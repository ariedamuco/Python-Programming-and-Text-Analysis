    Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I rise today to celebrate the achievement of one of West Virginia's finest healthcare facilities, Saint Joseph's Hospital in Parkersburg, West Virginia. Earlier this month, Saint Joseph's was recognized as one of the top 100 hospitals in the United States in a prestigious study conducted by the HCIA-Sachs Institute in conjunction with the University of Michigan School  of Public Health,. This is an enormous honor for one of West Virginia's critical health care providers. 
   St. Joseph's Hospital is an acute care regional healthcare facility. Located on the western edge of Wood County, the hospital's service area includes three counties in Ohio and eight counties in West Virginia, with a total population of 316,000. With the announcement of the top 100 hospitals, Saint Joseph's became the first facility in West Virginia to receive this great recognition. 
   I had the pleasure of visiting Saint Joseph's in October 1998, to partake in the ground breaking for their new $20 million extension. This extension has created over 100 new jobs at the hospital, adding to the 860 people already employed by Saint Joseph's. The extension replaced the physical facilities for surgical and emergency services, and consolidated the hospital's heart services. 
   The HCIA-Sachs study selects the top 100 hospitals based on five categories, depending on the number of beds and teaching status, and ranks them based on seven measures of clinical, operational, and financial performance. Saint Joseph's has been recognized as one of the top twenty large community benchmark hospitals, with more than 250 beds. The list encourages awareness of industry-wide benchmarks and the measurement of performance against peers. For example, the top hospitals have taken median average length of stay to a five-year low this year, and surpassed comparable hospitals in clinical quality measures, such as lower mortality and complications. 
   I find it highly gratifying that one of West Virginia's finest hospitals has been nationally recognized by this great honor. It is particularly striking that Saint Joseph's has been distinguished by a study with such very high standards as one of the top twenty facilities of its kind. I am so thankful to the Saint Joseph's Hospital's CEO Stephens Mundy, its doctors and nurses, and all of its employees for the amazing work that they continue to do to serve their community. The people of Wood County, West Virginia, and the surrounding areas, are indeed fortunate to have you as part of their community. Congratulations on this great achievement.

    Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, today I am especially proud to recognize the achievement of one of my state's most prized organizations, the Youth Museum of Southern West Virginia. Joining only 21 other museums nationwide, the Youth Museum has been selected as a recipient of this year's prestigious Institute of Museum and Library Service National Award for Museum Service. This award highlights the enormous contributions made by the Youth Museum to the growth and development of the children of Southern West Virginia. This organization is truly deserving of this national recognition. 
   Located in the beautiful mountains of Beckley, West Virginia, the Youth Museum has brought culture, art, and the rich tradition of Appalachian history to West Virginian school children since 1977. Earning the praise of teachers, parents, and school administrators, the Museum has touched the lives of thousands of families across the state. Without the vast resources of more urban contemporaries, the Youth Museum has helped to ensure that West Virginia's children have a sense of the diverse accomplishment and creativity that define their state's heritage. 
   An example of the unique and significant opportunities offered by the Youth Museum can be found in the Page After Page program. Recognizing the extraordinary number of talented writers to be found in our state, the Museum has brought together teachers, librarians, reading specialists, students, and native authors to create an exhibition that emphasizes literacy and the achievements of West Virginia artists. Combining a focus on improving reading skills with the unique and personal contributions of local writers, this program continues to challenge, stimulate, and inspire young readers across the state. 
   However, the Page After Page program is just one example of the Museum's commitment to providing positive and significant opportunities for West Virginia's youth. The Artists-in-Residence series, programs for special needs preschoolers, a planetarium, a science room, even a recreated pioneer village--the list of educational resources and activities is endless. Of course, this list reflects the hard work and dedication of an organization that has not wavered in its commitment to our children, or in its celebration of the unique and vital history of West Virginia. 
   For 23 years, the Youth Museum has been enriching the lives of the children and families in our great state. Truly, it was a privilege to nominate the Youth Museum of Southern West Virginia for this year's Award for Museum Service, and it was no surprise to learn that they were chosen for this prestigious national recognition. I am deeply proud of their accomplishment, and look forward to the many contributions the Museum will continue to make to the education of West Virginia's youth.

   Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I rise today on a personal basis to reflect a little bit about the SLADE GORTON I have known and worked with over a number of years now. Even as I welcome Mary Cantwell into the Senate, I also am very sorry to see SLADE GORTON go--just because of the very extraordinary character he brought to this institution. 
   I worked with SLADE very closely on the Commerce Committee. Our jurisdictions, so to speak, overlapped a good deal. Our interests overlapped a good deal. One of the pieces of legislation where I thought you saw SLADE working at his best, when he was so effective in the Senate, was the reauthorization of the Federal Aviation Agency. This was actually a very complicated piece of legislation. It was one that was particularly difficult because the Senate as a whole has not bothered to engage itself particularly with the whole subject of aviation and the enormity of the crisis which is facing us and which manifests itself in the summer and tourist season and then is quickly forgotten as soon as the tourist season is over and the delays diminish somewhat. One can see, as the industry grows, it also runs into more severe problems, financially and otherwise.

   Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I was absent from the Senate on the morning of Friday, October 27, 2000, during the vote on the motion to proceed to consideration of the conference report accompanying H.R. 2415, which contains the pending bankruptcy reform legislation. I was unable to return to the Senate in time for this unscheduled vote due to a commitment Friday morning in Charleston, West Virginia. Had I been in attendance in the Senate during that vote, I would have voted to proceed to the bankruptcy legislation. 
   My vote would not have changed the outcome of the vote on the motion to proceed.

    Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I am very proud that VISTA is celebrating its thirty-fifth anniversary this year. VISTA is special for me because it was my work in VISTA that brought me to West Virginia and changed the course of my career. 
   Because of my work in Emmons, WV, as a VISTA worker, I decided to make West Virginia my home and public service in government my life. In Emmons, I worked for a community center, preventative health care, and fought to get a school bus so those teens would get a high school education. From the grassroots, I learned how government can improve the quality of life in a community. I pursued a career in government, beginning with a seat in the West Virginia House of Delegates. My work in Emmons was very meaningful, and it changed me. I have stayed in touch with the people of Emmons and joined them this summer to celebrate the community finally getting clean water. 
   I have also stayed in touch with VISTA and was delighted to participate in the VISTA anniversary events, as many former VISTA workers did. 
   Mr. President, I ask to print in the Record, the remarks of John E. Gherty, president and CEO of Land O' Lakes, Inc., and more importantly a former VISTA worker. His remarks outline the history of VISTA and capture its vision for the future.

    Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I rise today to address a subject very close to my heart. Not long after my wife, Sharon, and I settled in West Virginia, my father presented me with a wonderful painting of the Kanawha River by Frederic Edwin Church, one of America's greatest nineteenth-century landscape painters. Thoroughly delighted with the painting, I became curious to know more about West Virginia's art history. What I discovered was a rich and varied tradition of artists, musicians and authors. Indeed, we in West Virginia have much to be proud of in the fields of fine art, music and literature, as well as theater, dance and architecture. 
   However, there has persisted a distinct lack of documentation of West Virginia's artistic tradition. That is, until now, with the publication of the groundbreaking book, Early Art and Artists in West Virginia. Compiled and narrated by Dr. John A. Cuthbert, in cooperation with West Virginia University Press, this book is the first of its kind. This wonderful compendium finally establishes a foundation upon which we can begin to explore the history of art in West Virginia, and examine the important contributions the state has made to the world of fine art. 
   Dr. Cuthbert offers us a richly illustrated explanation of the development of portrait and landscape painting, as well as lesser genres in the state. He has also compiled a directory of nearly one thousand artists who are a part of this special history, providing both teachers and scholars with an invaluable tool for further study. From the many visiting and native artists who worked in the panhandles in the early nineteenth century, to the members of the Hudson River School who delighted in the state's virgin forests several decades later, all are present in this remarkable volume. 
   The lovely portrait of Sophie B. Colston that graces the book's cover is but a sample of the caliber of their work. Set in a landscape that every West Virginian will recognize, this  masterpiece by Berkeley County's William Robinson Leigh suggests the underlying message of this book--that sophistication and elegance have long been a part of the state's celebrated mountain folk culture. 
   Since receiving Church's study of the Kanawha River from my father, I have continued to be intrigued by the fine art inspired by and produced in my adopted state. Few American communities the size of Charleston and Wheeling can boast symphony orchestras as accomplished as those found in these cities. Rebecca Harding Davis, Melville Davisson Post, Pearl S. Buck, Davis Grubb and Jayne Anne Phillips are but a few of the West Virginians who have contributed to the great canon of American literature. This uplifting part of our heritage deserves to be much better known. Early Art and Artists in West Virginia is a remarkable contribution toward this end. Thank you, John Cuthbert and West Virginia University Press, for this wonderful and important book.

    Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I rise today to celebrate the success of one of West Virginia's most successful non-profit health organizations. It gives me great honor to come to the floor today to be able to share with you the remarkable story of West Virginia Health Right, Inc. 
   West Virginia Heath Right was the brainchild of a group of dedicated volunteers who recognized a desperate need to provide free, quality health care to the homeless, the working poor, the un- and underinsured, de-institutionalized mental health patients, and countless others. Their vision was realized when they opened a small, mission-driven health clinic in Charleston, West Virginia in 1982. From these modest beginnings, West Virginia Health Right, Inc. grew tremendously fast. They soon found that the need in the community was far greater than they had expected and moved from their original location in a soup kitchen in Kanawha County, to a homeless shelter, and finally settled into the third floor of the Charleston Area Medical Center. In 1989, West Virginia Health Right moved to their own clinic building supported by funds from the community. In 1999, West Virginia Health Right again appealed to the community for support and found an overwhelming reception to their needs. They are now housed in a state of the art clinic in Charleston. 
   Modeling the success of the Charleston clinic, other free clinics began to sprout up in communities throughout the state at the rate of about one every two years. Today, Health Right has eight separate sites across West Virginia, including Charleston, Wheeling, Morgantown, Clarksburg, Huntington, Parkersburg, Bluefield, and Logan, which serve our State's poor and uninsured. Just recently, Health Right announced the opening of a new clinic in Beckley, West Virginia for which I am proud to serve as a board member. They will also be opening new locations in Summersville and Weirton. Remarkably, each of these facilities operates with just a small staff of employees, and relies entirely on the volunteer services of dedicated physicians and nurse practitioners from the area. 
   West Virginia Health Right, Inc. is a living example that just a few people can make a difference. Eighteen years ago, four doctors and a dozen volunteers set out with a vision to provide health care to those who needed it most. Today, Health Right is a network of more than 500 physicians and 15,000 volunteers serving 45,000 West Virginians each year. With the uninsured in this nation still at staggering levels, it gives me great pleasure to recognize the invaluable work of West Virginia Health Right, Inc., a group that rather than simply talking about a problem, is actually working to fill a vital need in our state. 
   Congratulations, West Virginia Health Right, for your success. And thank you for your tireless contributions to the state of West Virginia.

   Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, as the ranking member of the Committee on Veterans' Affairs, I urge my colleagues to support this comprehensive bill which would make changes to a wide range of veterans's benefits and services. The bill represents compromise on both sides of the aisle and in both Houses of Congress, and many, many hours of staff and Members' work. For that, I thank everyone involved. 
   The bill covers a wide spectrum of issues--from new educational benefits for service members to improvement in VA nurses' and dentists' pay. I would like to address some of the major provisions. 
   Mr. President, S. 1402, as amended, represents a comprehensive effort to address the shortfall in the amount provided for veterans' education. The current basic GI Bill benefit is $536 per month, which, according to College Board data, pays for less than 60 percent of the costs of a public four-year university. The cost of tuition and fees for public and private educational institutions rose approximately 90 percent from 1980-1995, while the MGIB benefit rates only increased 42 percent from 1985 to 1995. S. 1402 will provide an increase for fiscal year 2001 of 22 percent, raising the basic rate to $650 per month. 
   Additionally, this compromise bill adopts a Senate ``buy up'' provision that will allow servicemembers to elect to contribute up to an additional $600 (above the $1,200 that they contribute over their first year of service), in exchange for receiving four times their contribution. This additional contribution can be made at any time prior to the servicemember leaving service. Thus, it is targeted at those who definitely plan to pursue additional education when they leave service. 
   Although these increases fall short of the full tuition recommended last year by the Commission on Servicemembers and Veterans Transition Assistance, they will nevertheless provide a substantial improvement in assistance to veterans. The basic monthly benefit increase to $650, when combined with the maximum ``buy up'' contribution, would yield a monthly benefit of $800 per month, an increase of 49 percent over the current benefit. 
   I believe that education is the key to success in today's high tech, fast-paced economy. We must ensure that our nation's veterans do not wind up on the wrong side of the ``digital divide.'' It should be our policy to always encourage servicemembers and veterans to strive for greater achievement. Aside from the benefits that accrue to the individual veteran, we cannot overlook the benefits that accrue to our Nation when we provide a substantial educational benefit to veterans, including increased tax dollars from better salaries, greater stability through higher levels of home ownership rates, and a stronger recruiting tool for future servicemembers. 
   We also must remember our commitment to take care of the families of servicemembers killed on duty and families of veterans who are totally disabled due to their service. S. 1402 provides a corresponding increase in the monthly educational benefit, Dependents' Educational Assistance (DEA), provided to survivors and dependents of these veterans. Part of the reason that DEA is so low when compared to MGIB is that the MGIB rate has been indexed to the inflation rate, while the DEA has not. That is why it was so important to me that we index DEA, as section 111 of S. 1402 provides. This will ensure that the education benefit to eligible dependents and survivors will keep pace with the cost of education and MGIB benefits. 
   Last year, we expanded VA's authority to provide education benefits to veterans by including payment for pre-admission exam preparatory courses (SATs, GREs, etc). This year, through section 114, we are extending this valuable benefit to the eligible survivors and dependents of veterans through DEA. At some of the nation's top schools, scores on entrance exams can count for half of the total application, creating enormous pressure to score well. Studies by national consulting companies have shown improvement of over 100 points on the SAT exam scores for students who take exam preparatory courses. However, many of  these exam preparatory course are quite costly. One national provider charges as much as $750 for a two-month, part-time, SAT preparatory course. Fairtest, an educational advocacy group, argues that ``[t]he SAT has always favored students who can afford coaching over those who cannot. .....'' To be able to compete, it is critical that veterans' survivors and dependents have access to such courses. 
   Last year, along with Senator MURRAY and Senator DASCHLE, I introduced legislation that will provide much needed benefits to the children born with birth defects to female Vietnam veterans. I am enormously pleased that this legislation has been incorporated in S. 1402. 
   Section 401 will provide health care and compensation to children born with permanently disabling birth defects to women Vietnam veterans. The legislation had its inception in a comprehensive study the VA conducted of long-term reproductive health outcomes of women Vietnam-era veterans. After analyzing the records of over 4,000 women Vietnam veterans compared with 4,000 women Vietnam-era veterans, the study found a ``statistically significant increase in birth defects,'' particularly moderate to severe birth defects, in the children of the women Vietnam veterans. According to the study, the risk to a woman Vietnam veteran of having a child with birth defects was significantly elevated, even after adjusting for age, 
   demographic variables, military characteristics, and smoking and alcohol consumption of the mothers. 
   As VA does not have the authority under current law to provide health care or their benefits to the children of women Vietnam veterans disabled from birth defects other than spinal bifida, I worked with VA to craft legislation modeled after that groundbreaking spina bifida legislation to address this issue. 
   It is only fitting that we assist these children. Their mothers served our Nation with honor and courage, volunteering to be placed in harm's way, without knowledge of what effects their service may bring later. They were the nurses, mapmakers, air traffic controllers, clerical staff, Red Cross and USO workers, and others who supported our troops in the field. Unfortunately, some of their children have suffered because of their mothers' service, and it is time for them to begin to be repaid for that suffering. 
   Under the provisions of S. 1402, VA would be authorized to provide reimbursement for health care of the disabled children for their birth defect and associated conditions, vocational rehabilitation services, and a monthly allowance that is not countable as income for the purpose of other federal programs. 
   Women Vietnam veterans have waited 25 years for this acknowledgment of the special risks they faced. Helping their children born with birth defects is the logical extension of our policy to provide benefits for disabilities that result from service. It's the compassionate and the right thing to do, and I am enormously gratified that we are finally doing it.

   Mr. ROCKEFELLER. First, I would like to comment on the comments that were made by Senator TORRICELLI from New Jersey. I thought they were profound, moving, and obviously urgent. 
   What I regret to have to report to him is that the Senate Finance Committee, on which I serve on the minority side, has concluded there will be no markup. There will with no markup on the balanced budget amendment. So this is very sad. This is part of the denigration of the process of this entire institution. 
   There is no health care legislation that has come out of the Finance Committee, or anywhere else, in the last 2 years. We could go through that litany. 
   But I want to report my profound discouragement to the Senator that we were told yesterday there would be no markup, no markup on the one thing that we could do to help not only the people you are talking about but all the hospitals and hospices and skilled nursing facilities, home health agencies in our States which are suffering. 
   So we have to rely on the good will of the President when he meets with leaders, Republican leaders. Hopefully, maybe a Democrat will be included in that meeting. Maybe something can happen. 
   But this is where we have arrived at in this institution. It is unfortunate. It is wretched. It has a terrible consequence for the people who you so movingly and eloquently talked about.

   Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I come before the Senate today to speak about an issue--the plight of captive shippers--on which the Senator from North Dakota, Mr. DORGAN, spoke and on which I have been working for 16 years, every day I have been in the Senate, with a complete, absolute, and total lack of success. One doesn't ordinarily admit those things, but I say that because that is how bad the situation is. That is how unwilling the Congress is to address this problem even though it affects every single Senator and every single Congressman in the entire United States of America without a single exception. 
   How did this happen is the same question as asking why is it that people complain about planes being late but don't take any interest in aviation policy. We are a policy body. We are meant to deliberate; we are meant to discuss issues. We don't. We don't take any interest in aviation. So we complain but don't do anything. We take no interest in railroad policy, and so we don't complain and we don't do anything. 
   As a result, the American Association of Railroads, which is one of the  all-time most powerful lobbying groups in the country, has its way. As Senator DORGAN said, they have their way although there are only really four or five railroads left. When I came here in 1985, as the junior Senator from West Virginia, there were 50 or 60 class I railroads. Those are the big ones. Now there are four or five, probably soon to be two or three. 
   When the Staggers Act was passed to deregulate the railroads, which unfortunately this Congress did in 1980, they divided it into two parts. They said for those railroads which had competition, the market would set the price. But they said there are about--let's pick the number--20 percent of all railroads which have no competition. In the coal mines, steel mills, granaries, and manufacturing facilities that these railroads serve, there is no competition. Their rates would be determined by the Interstate Commerce Commission at that time. Now it is called the Surface Transportation Board. Very few of my colleagues know anything about the Surface Transportation Board or knew anything about the Interstate Commerce Commission, even though many of their people are suffering vastly from the consequences of the inaction of these two bodies. 
   We don't have railroad competition in many aspects of our economy. You can't move coal by a pickup truck and you can't fly it in an airplane, you have to move it in a train. Sometimes you can put it in a truck, but you have to basically put it in a train. The Presiding Officer knows that very well; he comes from a State that produces coal.

   Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Senator EDWARDS' amendment establishes a Technology Partnership Ombudsman at Department of Energy's National Laboratories. It is my understanding that the Ombudsman should promote the use of collaborative alternative dispute resolution techniques such as mediation to facilitate the speedy and low-cost resolution of complaints and disputes with industry partners. To ensure fairness and objectivity, however, it would be the Senator's intent that nothing in this Section be interpreted to empower the Ombudsman to act as a mediator or an arbitrator in the process.

   Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, as a member of the Congressional Coalition on Adoption, I would like to commend Senators MARY LANDRIEU and LARRY CRAIG for their leadership in creating the Angels in Adoption program. I am happy to join in this initiative to honor the special families that open their hearts and homes when they adopt a child. This year I want to recognize a special family from Falling Waters, West Virginia as our very own angels in adoption. The Merryman family has been nominated for the Angels in Adoption Award by Steve Wiseman, Executive Director of West Virginia Developmental Disability Council, for being outstanding examples of adoptive parents. 
   Scott and Faith Merryman have been happily married for 32 years and live in Berkeley County, West Virginia. They both work in the disability field, Scott as a supervisory mentor at the Autism Center and Faith at the West Virginia Parent Training Information Center, a resource center for parents of children with special needs. 
   They have 6 children, 8 grandchildren, and one great-grandchild. Two of their children, Richard and Hope, are adopted and they are in the process of adopting another foster child, Charity Megan. 
   Richard, who has cerebral palsy, is 26 years old, and now lives in his own apartment. Richard is a member of the West Virginia Team of the President's Committee on Mental Retardation and attended the International Academy in 1999. He is also a member of the West Virginia Developmental Disabilities Council and a self-directed activist on accessibility and other disability issues. 
   Hope was adopted at 13 days old because her birth parents were unable to take care of her. She is now 19 years old and enjoys working as an Assistant Manager in a local restaurant as well as spending time with her family. 
   Charity Megan came to the Merryman family when she was 14 months old from an institution. She is now 17 years old, and has severe disabilities including facial deformities, stunted growth, mental retardation, and a seizure disorder. 
   Despite the long hours of care and trips to the doctor, Scott and Faith say that they have learned a lot about the kind of things money can't buy--like love and laughter. 
   I am proud to honor the Merrymans for the love that they show their family, and to the commitment they share in promoting adoption. In my own state of West Virginia, we have had a 51 percent increase in the number of adoptions since 1995 because of caring families like the Merrymans. 
   We as a Nation need to continue to offer our support to these special families. As a member of Congress I will continue to introduce legislation that will build on the foundation of the 1997 Adoption and Safe Families Act to ensure our children a safe and stable home.

   Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, as the ranking member of the Committee on Veterans' Affairs, I am enormously pleased that the Senate has passed this bill to reestablish the Department of Veterans Affairs' duty to assist veterans in developing their claims for benefits from the Department. Senator MURRAY, who introduced the original Senate bill, S. 1810, that led to this compromise bill should be praised for her leadership on this issue. 
   The ``duty to assist,'' along with other principles such as giving the veteran the benefit of the doubt in benefits' determinations, are parts of what make the relationship between the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and the claimant unique in the Federal Government. Congress has long recognized that this Nation owes a special obligation to its veterans. The system to provide benefits to veterans was never intended to be adversarial or difficult for the veteran to navigate. That is why Congress codified, in the Veterans Judicial Review Act of 1988 (Public Law 100-687), these longstanding practices of the VA to help claimants develop their claims for veterans benefits. 
   Over time, the U.S. Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims attempted to give meaning to loosely defined, but well-ingrained concepts of law. In Caluza v. Brown, the Court identified three requirements that would be necessary to establish a well-grounded claim, which the Court viewed as a prerequisite to VA's duty to assist. These requirements were: (1) a medical diagnosis of a current disability; (2) medical or lay evidence of the inservice occurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) medical evidence of a nexus or link between an inservice injury or disease and the current disability. Through a series of cases, which culminated in Morton v. West, the Court ruled that VA has no authority to develop claims that are not ``well-grounded.'' This resulted in a change of practice where VA no longer sought records or offered medical examinations and opinions to assist the veteran in ``grounding'' the claim. 
   Veterans advocates, VA, and Congress grew very concerned over this situation and the resulting potential unfairness to veterans. Veterans may be required to submit records that are in the government's possession (e.g., VA medical records, military service records, etc.). Also, veterans who could not afford medical treatment and did not live near or did not use a VA medical facility (and thus had no medical records to submit) would not be provided a medical exam. Many veterans claims were denied as not well-grounded. 
   Therefore, Congress, with significant input from the veterans service organizations and VA, developed legislation to correct this problem. H.R. 4864, as amended, reflects the compromise language developed jointly by the staff of the House and Senate Committees on Veterans' Affairs. I believe that this bill restores VA to its pre-Morton duty to assist, as well as enhances VA's obligation to notify claimants of what is necessary to establish a claim and what evidence VA has not been able to obtain before it makes its decision on the claim. 
   In developing this compromise, it was very important to me to ensure that veterans will get all the assistance that is necessary and relevant to their claim for benefits. This assistance should include obtaining records, providing medical examinations to determine the veteran's disability or opinions as to whether the disability is related to service, or any other assistance that VA needs to decide the claim. On the other hand, it was also important to balance this duty against the futility of requiring VA to develop claims where there is no reasonable possibility that the assistance would substantiate the claim. For example, wartime service is a statutory requirement for VA non-service-connected pension benefits. Therefore, if a veteran with only peacetime service sought pension, no level of assistance would help the veteran prove the claim; and if VA were to spend time developing such a claim, some other veteran's claim where assistance would be helpful would be delayed. However we need to ensure that the bar is no longer set so high that veterans with meritorious claims will be turned away without assistance. 
   H.R. 4864, as amended, does specify certain types and levels of assistance for compensation claims. The majority of VA's new casework is in making these initial disability determinations. If the record could be developed properly the first time the veteran submits an application for benefits, subsequent appeals or claims for rating increases or for service connection for additional conditions would be much more accurate and efficient. 
   The compromise bill provides that VA shall provide a veteran a medical examination or a medical opinion when such an exam or opinion is necessary to make a decision on the claim. The bill specifies one instance when an exam or opinion is necessary--when there is competent evidence that the veteran has a disability or symptoms that may be related to service, but there is not sufficient evidence to make a decision. This determination may be based upon a lay statement by the veteran on a subject that he or she is competent to speak about. That is, if a veteran comes to VA claiming that she or he has a pain in his leg that may be related to service--and there is no evidence that the veteran, for example, was awarded a workers compensation claim for a leg disability last month--VA must provide an examination or opinion. The veteran can probably not provide evidence that the pain is due to traumatic arthritis; that would requires a doctor's expertise. H.R. 4864 does recognize that there are many other instances when a medical examination or opinion would be appropriate or necessary. 
   Again, by specifying certain types of assistance for compensation claims,  the bill does not limit VA's assistance to those types of claims or to a specific type of assistance. It expressly provides that nothing in the bill prevents the Secretary from rendering whatever assistance is necessary. It also does not undo some of the complementary Court decisions that require the VA to render certain additional types of assistance, such as those required in McCormick v. Gober. 
   Although VA is moving its claims adjudication system toward a team-based, case management system that will result in better service and communication with claimants, I felt that it was critical to include requirements that VA explain to claimants what information and evidence will be needed to prove their claim. VA will also be required to explain what information and evidence it would secure (e.g., medical records, service medical records, etc.) and what information the claimant should submit (e.g., marriage certificate, Social Security number, etc.). Currently, many veterans are asked for information in a piecemeal fashion and don't know what VA is doing to secure other evidence. Better communication will lead to expedited decisionmaking and higher satisfaction in the process. 
   H.R. 4864, as amended, provides for retroactive applications of the bill's duty to assist provisions, as well as the enhanced notice procedures. Now, claimants that were denied due to the Morton decision will be able to have their claims readjudicated in accordance with the provisions of this bill and receive VA's full duty to assist. This will also ensure an earlier effective date if their claim is successful. 
   It is critical that we honor our commitment to veterans and their families. We should not create technicalities and bureaucratic hoops for them to jump through. I am pleased that Congress is able to move this provision and begin the restoration of VA's duty to assist claimants in developing the evidence and information necessary to establish their claims for veterans benefits.

    Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I rise today to celebrate the philanthropy of one of West Virginia's most celebrated adopted daughters. Later this month at a formal naming ceremony, the Marshall University School of Medicine in Huntington, West Virginia, will be renamed the Joan C. Edwards School of Medicine at Marshall University. It gives me great honor to come to the floor today to be able to share Joan Edwards' remarkable story with the nation. 
   Born in London, England, Joan's family moved to New Orleans when she was only four years old. At the age of 17, Joan set off to tour the nation singing the ``Sugar Blues'' with Clyde McCoy and his Kentucky band. As a young girl, Joan's singing career brought her to Chicago, New York, and Pittsburgh, among other cities, where she met her future husband and Huntington, West Virginia native, James ``Jim'' Edwards. Joan and Jim were married soon after, and lived in Pittsburgh prior to returning to Huntington to work at the Edwards' family business, National Mattress Company. Together, Jim and Joan would build the family's business into a great American success story and were also able to take up their passion of breeding racehorses. 
   In 1991, after 54 years of marriage, Jim Edwards lost his battle with cancer. Shortly thereafter, Joan Edwards announced that she would present a total of over $20 million in contributions to the Huntington community from their estate. This included $1 million to the Marshall University School of Medicine, $1 million to the Huntington Museum of Art, $2 million to the Episcopal Church, and $16 million to the Cabell Huntington Hospital for the construction of an adult cancer center. 
   This story in and of itself is remarkable, but Joan Edwards' charity goes even beyond that. Since that time, Joan has donated an additional $1 million to the Fine and Performing Arts Center at Marshall and $2 million to address the University's most pressing needs. And Joan Edwards has not stopped there. She has raised the bar even further. Having lost both her husband and son to cancer, Joan has bequeathed an additional $16 million to the Marshall University Medical School with an additional $2 million dedicated toward preliminary planning, design, and development for the creation of a children's cancer center. 
   It is indeed fitting that Marshall University will bestow a great honor upon Mrs. Edwards, formally renaming its Medical School the Joan C. Edwards School of Medicine at Marshall University. I would also like to point out that only one-third of all of the medical schools in the nation are named after a benefactor. Of these institutions, Marshall University's School of Medicine will be the first in the nation named after a woman. This is such a fitting tribute for such an amazing woman. 
   Joan has demonstrated the true meaning of philanthropy. Her active engagement in academics, the arts, athletics, and health care has impacted the lives of countless people in West Virginia and across the country, serving as an inspiration to us all. She has done more for the foundation of the community than most people would ever be able to do, and we are fortunate to have her as part of the fabric of West Virginia. I thank Joan for all of her selfless acts, and as we celebrate this honor, I am reminded of how proud I am that she is a fellow West Virginian.

   Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, many of us have struggled for months to decide what is the right vote on China PNTR--the right vote for our individual states, the right vote for the Nation. I certainly have, as I have tried to grasp what effect PNTR with China might have on my state of West Virginia. 
   Over the last few months I've taken some time to listen and to talk with people in my state, to review where we are in West Virginia under the current trading system. I've tried to assess if West Virginia will be helped or disadvantaged if the Congress rejects PNTR. That is what I care about more than anything. 
   It is well known that West Virginia is a long way from enjoying the full benefits of the economic boom that we hear so much about. Unemployment remains over 5 percent, stuck stubbornly far above the national average. Our per capita income is $19,362, 49th among the states. Far too many of our working poor require food stamps, and far too many remain uninsured. And while I will fight every day to bring more and better jobs to West Virginia, the fact remains that we are a long way from providing the economic opportunities for the thousands of West Virginians who want to improve their lives, or are just struggling to survive from day to day. 
   There are many complex reasons that my state lags behind the nation economically. But one significant reason-- which I believe with all of my heart and which I cannot ignore--is the simple fact that our current international trading system is simply not working for the people of West Virginia. The status quo is not working for West Virginia, neither for its workers nor for its industries. 
   We are just not being fairly treated under the current rules. Witness the struggle we have faced to protect our critical steel industry. Cheap and illegal imports began flooding the U.S. market in late 1997. A full two years passed before the first trade cases were resolved and the domestic industry got any relief and remedy. In those two years, six steel producers went bankrupt. Thousands were laid off. The impact on those companies, their employees, and the steel communities was devastating. And that is why I introduced fair trade legislation that would give our steel industry a fairer chance to prevent illegal steel dumping in the future. The status quo, our current unfair trade laws, were not working for West Virginia. 
   We in West Virginia are not being protected by the current trading rules. They are causing us to lose ground, lose jobs, and lose industries. I love my state too much to allow this to continue without fighting in every way I know to make it better. I will not vote to continue the current rules. I will not vote to maintain the status quo. 
   A vote in favor of PNTR for China will allow us to deal specifically with China on steel. For example, under today's unfair trade laws, the President must take uniform action against all countries that are dumping their imports on our market. Under current law and the status quo, the United States cannot single out one country for a tough remedy. Under the bilateral's antisurge provisions, we could address an influx of imports from China specifically. That is just one example, there are a few other provisions of the bilateral that could also work to, in essence, strengthen our ability to guard against Chinese steel disrupting our market. 
   West Virginia's chemical industry will benefit greatly from the tariff reduction that will come from passing PNTR legislation. The chemical industry is the largest industrial employer in West Virginia with an average salary of $51,000. During this debate, I heard from all of our chemical companies about the potential they have to increase their exports to China once this agreement goes into effect. Companies like DuPont who wrote me recently with the following: ``DuPont currently exports to China almost $16 million of products from our plants in West Virginia, and we see those exports increasing as the Chinese economy grows. West Virginia is, in fact, the second leading exporter to China, surpassed only by Texas, among DuPont operations nationwide. West Virginia exports will drop to zero, however, if Congress does not enact PNTR legislation--because China will keep its tariffs high for U.S. exporters while lowering its tariffs for all other members'  nations of WTO. Enactment of this legislation is, therefore, extremely important to DuPont and to our 3500 employees in West Virginia.'' 
   It also means that as a part of the international trading regime, China will have to deal with 131 other trading partners who all will be incredibly vigilant to ensure that China is playing by the rules. It will not be a perfect system, but it will be a much better system. 
   So I say, Mr. President, when you have the opportunity to do trade and business with 1.2 billion people, to engage them with the world as we do today, to change the status quo that is not working for West Virginia, then you must do what is right. It's even more important when your state ranks 4th among all 50 states in percentage of products made that are exported abroad. That is why I will vote today to approve Permanent Normal Trade Relations with China. 
   To be clear, the vote we take today is not about China entering the WTO. Others have said this, but it bears repeating over and over. The American people must understand this: China will enter the WTO no matter what the Congress does. 
   So, the sole question we must answer is, what will the impact be if the Congress rejects PNTR? Has this annual review of our trading relationship with China had the impact we had hoped it would, and what will be the effect of rejecting PNTR on West Virginia and all the United States? 
   First, as to the impact on China. 
   I do not accept, indeed, I abhor, the unfair and sometimes inhumane conditions faced by 
   the people of that largest of the world's countries. I have spent a considerable amount of time in that part of the world and I know conditions there are unacceptable. All people who love freedom decry the violations of people's rights in China. As the leader of the free world, America must acknowledge its responsibility to do all in our power to better China's treatment of its people. 
   I also believe we should encourage nations like China, where fast-growing economies will increase both energy demand and greenhouse gas emissions, to use the cleanest technologies available. In fact, I view PNTR as the best means of introducing these mostly-American technologies, some of the most cutting-edge of which were developed in West Virginia, to the Chinese energy sector. 
   At the same time, I cannot say that the Congress' annual review of China has had any impact on China whatsoever--and we are just kidding ourselves if we think denying China PNTR now will improve labor or human rights. The annual PNTR review was supposed to provide us with some leverage to improve the conditions in China. But in reality, it has become mostly a feel-good, rubber stamp process here in the Congress that has no impact. Neither wages nor working conditions nor environmental safeguards have been advanced because we go through the annual charade of PNTR. I wish this were not true; the world experience says it is. 
   What will improve labor and human rights in China, in my view, is our working to bring China into a world living under law, acting to bring China into a fairer trading system without its restrictive tariffs and other barriers, and fighting to force China to deal in the world of nations under fairer rules, not just its own rules. Fighting to make China play by the rules--that's a fight I'm willing to make! 
   So I turn then to my second question: Will our country and my state be disadvantaged if we reject PNTR? 
   To that there is only one answer--I am convinced we, my state, my country, will be harmed if PNTR is rejected. No one else. 
   Remember, China will enter the WTO no matter how the Congress votes on PNTR. When that happens, and if we reject PNTR, all other WTO nations will have the upper hand, and all of our trading partners will benefit from lower tariffs and greater access to the world's largest market. Other nations will have all of the advantages in doing business there. Our workers, our industries, our farmers--all will have lost this new opportunity to gain fairer access to the largest of the world's untapped economies. Why would we want to squander that opportunity? 
   Rejecting PNTR means we lose--America loses--the many important concessions that were won last year in our government's negotiations with China. All will be lost, including unprecedented concessions that will give U.S. industries the upper hand in cases where the fairness of China's trading practices is in question. The bilateral agreement provides a twelve year product specific safeguard that ensures that the U.S. can take action on China if imports from that country cause market disruptions here in America. China has also agreed to grant U.S. industries the right to apply non-market methodology in anti-dumping cases for the next 15 years. This is a major boon for U.S. industries suffering from injury caused by unfair and illegal imports. China makes other concessions as well, which make it easier for businesses in this country to prove countervailing duty cases against China. 
   These new provisions could be used to help companies, like Portec Rail, in Huntington, West Virginia, who may have been harmed from dumping of Chinese steel rail joints. It seems to me that companies like Portec Rail might be early beneficiaries of these stronger import surge provisions. 
   Let me be clear, these provisions improve the status quo. They are stronger than our current unfair trade laws. Under the new agreement, China will finally be required to greatly lower its barriers to our trade there. China makes all the concessions. We have nothing to gain--and everything to lose--by rejecting PNTR. 
   And lose we will. What would be the likelihood of Chinese retaliation if we reject PNTR? There is little doubt in my mind that China would retaliate against U.S. economic interests. On a purely political level, it would bolster China's hardline forces of party control and state enterprise. And this could destabilize an area of the world that I care deeply about, the Taiwan Straits. I have spent a large part of my time working on the cross Straits issue between China and Taiwan. I want to see peace in that region. I want to see Taiwan join the WTO. But, rejection of this deal could have real dangerous consequences for Taiwan. China is simply too unpredictable, and could paralyze our efforts to promote peace and economic stability in Asia and around the globe. 
   Mr. President, of course we need to be vigilant and tough with China as we take advantage of this new economic opportunity. I fully realize that China has generally gone about its trading business however it saw fit, doing whatever it wanted and barring most competition. That cannot continue, and that is exactly why I believe we must bring China into and under the scrutiny of the WTO. We must make China play by a fairer set of rules, which means bringing them into a trading system governed by rules that we have helped create. And rules that we can enforce. 
   Mr. President, this is an opportunity for America that I am willing to fight for.

    Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, today I rise to celebrate the life and accomplishments of one of West Virginia's most esteemed citizens, Coach Jerome Van Meter. On August 15th of this year, Coach Van Meter will celebrate his 100th birthday. A remarkable milestone for a truly remarkable man, Coach Van Meter's birthday provides a special opportunity for all of West Virginia to join in thanking him for a lifetime of service to our state.  
   With a career that has spanned a century, there isn't much that Coach Van Meter hasn't accomplished. Known affectionately as just Coach to his many students, he led the Beckley Flying Eagles to three state championships in football, and six more in basketball. A member of the National High School Sports Hall of Fame, Coach was both a beloved teacher and principal and served on the faculty of Beckley College. In addition to the numerous honors and awards he has received, Coach Van Meter holds the great distinction of being a surviving veteran of both World Wars. 
   Today, however, the countless lives touched by Coach are his greatest legacy. The lessons he taught on the basketball court and football field brought many victories, but the lessons of life he taught his players and students shaped their destinies in more profound ways. Dedication, hard work, compassion and dignity are the touchstones of Coach Van Meter's career, and his example continues to inspire us. 
   Thank you, Coach, for the invaluable contributions you have made to the families and communities of West Virginia. As you celebrate this very special birthday, you have my deepest admiration and gratitude.

   Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, over the last several years health care reform has dropped off our national and Congressional agenda. We talk about it primarily to posture politically, not because we are determined to actually succeed in extending coverage. Too often, the goal seems to be to simply create a campaign issue and make voters believe we are working to solve the problem, when in reality no progress is being made. 
   This year, we have seen a lot of talking on health care, but it's clear that Congress' priorities lie elsewhere. Just this past week we passed a tax break that will affect only 1.7 percent of Americans, yet will cost us $50 billion a year when fully phased in. In the meantime, 40 million people, mostly of modest incomes, continue to live their lives with little hope of getting the health coverage they need. 
   The question that Congress needs to answer: will we continue to sit back and simply watch as the problem of the uninsured grows worse? 
   Along with Senator KENNEDY, and Congressmen DINGELL, STARK and WAXMAN, I obviously have very clear answers to this question. And today we are offering a commonsense, bi-partisan step that Congress can take this year to improve the plight of working, uninsured families. 
   We know that the majority of those without health insurance are concentrated in lower-income, working families. The Medicaid and CHIP Family Care Improvement Act would target our efforts to these families by allowing states to extend Medicaid and CHIP to the parents of eligible children. This is a sensible, affordable expansion that will make a real and immediate difference for many American families. 
   In addition, FamilyCare would provide assistance to increase coverage for workers in small businesses by providing grant money for states to pursue new and innovative approaches to expand health insurance coverage through small business. 
   Our plan also gives states a number of new tools to help improve outreach and enrollment in Medicaid and the State Children's Health Insurance Program. 
   FamilyCare would provide health insurance coverage to millions of low-income working families for a fraction of the cost of the recently-passed tax breaks that affect only a small number of people. 
   Eight years ago, the fight for universal health care had a surge of energy and there was a common purpose among political leaders and the American people. Unfortunately, little progress has been made since then. While the number of uninsured has grown from 36 million in 1993 to 44 million in 1999, we have stood by as a nation and simply watched. Over the next 3 years, about 30 percent of the population, 81 million Americans, can expect a gap in their health insurance coverage lasting at least one month. It is practically inconceivable--and morally wrong--that we are allowing this to happen in such a strong economy, with an extremely competitive labor market. 
   It is time to end the failed experiment of trying to let the disease cure itself. We need to accomplish the goal of comprehensive reform in any way we can--even if it means continuing to work on incremental changes, as long as we always keep our target squarely set on universal coverage. 
   Today, we are giving Congress the opportunity to take a major step forward in accomplishing this goal. With FamilyCare, we are simply taking a program that is already working to reduce the number of uninsured, and expanding it to cover more people who we know need the help. 
   This approach makes so much sense that even the conservative Health Insurance Association of America--the organization that helped to defeat universal coverage--has offered its support. In addition, our bill has four Republicans as original cosponsors. With this bipartisan bill we have a real opportunity to stop talking about expanding health coverage, and start acting.

   Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleagues, Senators GRASSLEY, JEFFORDS, and LINCOLN, in the introduction of legislation to establish a tax credit incentive program for the production of super energy-efficient appliances. This creative proposal will result in substantial environmental benefits for the nation at a very small cost to the government. 
   Our bill would provide for either a $50 or $100 tax credit for the production and sale of energy efficient washing machines and refrigerators. Today, these two appliances account for approximately 15 percent of the energy consumed in a typical home, which amounts to about $21 billion in energy expenditures annually. Although most Americans may not realize it, home appliances offer the potential for major energy savings across the nation. 
   Recently, several energy efficiency and environmental organizations joined with the appliance industry in endorsing considerably tougher energy-efficiency standards for washing machines. These proposed standards are now under active consideration by the Department of Energy for incorporation in new regulations. The new standards will result in tremendous energy-efficiency improvements that will have very positive environmental consequences over time. But there is a cost to these new minimum standards and, as we often find, reluctance on the part of industry and the public to incur the additional costs necessary to achieve higher energy efficiencies. Home appliances can be made more efficient but it would mean greater costs to consumers. I believe there is a necessary balance between the objective of obtaining higher energy efficiencies that reduce air emissions and the higher product costs that result. This is as true with respect to the purchase of appliances as it is with respect to the automobile, electric power, and other markets. I also recognize that there are understandable limits to the costs that society is willing to bear through regulation to obtain higher energy savings that result in environmental benefits. 
   However, that is not necessarily the limit at which point energy savings can be achieved. While many consumers may not be willing to pay extra for more energy-efficient appliances, I believe they can be encouraged to do so through incentive programs. The legislation we are proposing today would do just that by giving manufacturers either a $50 or $100 tax credit for every super energy-efficient appliance produced prior to 2007. The idea is to give manufacturers the means by which to create the most appropriate incentives to get consumers to purchase washing machines and refrigerators that are the most energy-efficient. Through these tax credits we will accelerate the production and market penetration of leading-edge appliance technologies that create significant environmental benefits. 
   The expanded use of super energy-efficient appliances will have significant long-term environmental benefits. It is estimated that as a result of this legislation over 200 trillion Btus of energy will be saved over the life of the appliances manufactured with these credits. This is the equivalent of taking 2.3 million cars off the road or closing down six coal-fired power plants for 
   a year. Energy savings of this magnitude pay significant environmental dividends. For example, it is projected that with these energy savings carbon emissions, the critical element in greenhouse gas emissions, will be reduced by over 3.1 million metric tons. In addition, the super energy-efficient washing machines will reduce the amount of water necessary to wash clothes by 870 billion gallons, or approximately the amount of water necessary to meet the needs of every household in a state the size of West Virginia for nearly 2 years. 
   Vice President GORE recently recommended a similar program of tax incentives for the purchase of home appliances as part of his energy savings initiatives--and I congratulate him for his leadership in this regard. I am very glad the Vice President is considering ways to balance how we produce energy savings and believe it is important that we discuss this balance of interests as part of our national dialogue to improve our energy efficiency. I am also extremely pleased this legislation is strongly supported by leading environmental organizations including the Natural Resources Defense Council, the Alliance to Save Energy, and the American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy. 
   The use of energy-efficient appliances is an important milestone on the road to a cleaner, lower-cost energy future. This common-sense initiative follows on the heels of other important bipartisan legislation that I am proud to have sponsored or cosponsored during this Congress to improve our nation's energy independence and the environment. During the first session of the 106th Congress, I was joined by Senators HATCH, CRAPO, and BRYAN in introducing the Alternative Fuel Promotion Act in an effort to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and lower our consumption of imported oil. Earlier this year I joined Senators JEFFORDS and HATCH on the Alternative Fuels Tax Incentives Act, which would accomplish many of the same goals. 
   I am especially proud to have joined with Senator BINGAMAN and six of my Democratic colleagues on the Energy Security Tax and Policy Act, a comprehensive energy policy bill that looks to improve our nation's energy independence while protecting the environment. Finally, it was my pleasure last week to join with Environment and Public Works Chairman BOB SMITH and the Ranking Democratic Member Senator BAUCUS on the Energy Efficient Building Incentives Act, which promotes the construction of buildings 30-50 percent more efficient than today's standard. As building energy use accounts for 35 percent of the air pollution emissions nationwide and $250 billion per year in energy bills, this legislation could produce a dramatic benefit for our environment, and this country's long-term energy needs.

   Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I believe in the importance of the New Markets initiative to promote growth and economic development in struggling communities across our country. I have worked closely with Senator ROBB on this effort, as well as the President and his Administration. Given the commitment of President Clinton and Speaker HASTERT, I believe we may have a real chance to enact meaningful legislation on New Markets. 
   But I do not believe the Santorum amendment is the right starting point. I have serious questions about the provisions in the bill labeled ``Charitable Choice.'' While I strongly support and admire the community development and social service work performed by faith-based organizations, I am deeply troubled by the potential for discrimination in hiring on the basis of an applicant's faith with programs funded by federal dollars. This is not good public policy. 
   Senator ROBB has announced his intention to introduce another New Markets bill, and I will continue to work closely with the distinguished Senator from Virginia. We introduced the original New Markets bill in August of 1999, and I am committed to working for passage of a final package. But such an important initiative deserves consideration in the Finance Committee, and more than ten minutes of flood debate. 
   West Virginia has several Empowerment Zones/Enterprise Communities, including Huntington, McDowell County, the Central Appalachia Community and the Upper Kanawha Community. These communities are working hard  to deliver on the promise of the President's economic development initiative, and I am proud of our progress. Together we can make a real difference. 
   I hope that the Santorum amendment will not prevail, but that Members will work together to build on the Clinton-Hastert initiative to develop vital legislation to promote New Markets. We should provide tax incentives to promote new investments. We should expand on the success of Empowerment Zones and create new Renewal Communities to help small businesses get started in struggling communities. We should invest in affordable housing by expanding the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit and promote home ownership by expanding Mortgage Revenue Bonds. We should make these strategic investments, but not include language that might allow discrimination in hiring practices which would cause controversy and hinder the important investments of New Markets.

   Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I rise to comment on the bill Senator KENNEDY and others have worked on which is formally called the Medicaid/CHIP Family Improvement Act, but I will simply refer to it as the Family Care Act. 
   Most of the people in this country who are uninsured work. A lot of Americans assume that if somebody does not have health insurance, there is lack of merit or effort on their part. Most of the people who do not have health insurance are, in fact, working every single day. They are working, and many happen to be the working poor. 
   The whole philosophy of the earned-income tax credit, which President Reagan started and a lot of people continued, is that if people are poor and are working, we say: Good, you have taken a job; as a result of taking a job, you have given up your Medicaid health care benefits, and in America we respect that you are taking a risk by going out into the marketplace. You are probably not getting health insurance because of the low wages you are being paid but, nevertheless, you value work and you are going ahead with it. 
   This is the same spirit we are talking about in the Family Care Act. We value people who work. We value people who work for low wages, and we want to help them and their families. 
   Essentially through the Family Care Act, not only do we have the CHIP program, with which we are all familiar, which was started in 1996, which has been moderately successful for 2 million out of the 11 million children in this country, but we expand that. We say: Let your parents be included in this, too, because you are all part of the same family. 
   The Senator from Alabama was just talking about the importance of protecting the family. This is an example of how to do that. The parent of the child receiving the Children's Health Insurance Program is probably without health insurance, so why not expand that to include that parent, which brings the family together on health insurance. It is sensible. 
   We also provide some money because it is very hard in places such as West Virginia and, I suspect, Alabama, both of which are essentially rural States, and most States in this country have very rural aspects to them--it is very hard to reach out and find the children. We go through the School Lunch Program, but not everybody wants to admit they are on Medicaid or they are available for the CHIP program. It is hard to reach out, so we provide more money to the States to do that in ways the States believe are appropriate. 
   We also provide States some money for other ways they might think of to do innovative planning to include parents and expand those who are uninsured. 
   It is interesting to me because we are talking a lot about health care but not doing very much about it. I remember when President Clinton was elected. Although his health care bill did not succeed, there was a lot of energy around here. The energy did not start out to be partisan. It started out that he was elected to do universal health care, and there was a lot of talk. 
   At that time, the only industrialized countries in the world that did not have universal health insurance were the United States and South Africa. South Africa now has universal health insurance, and the United States is still the only country which does not. 
   Of course, we are in a massively successful economic situation with a lot of people working and a lot of opportunities to make these changes. What I worry about and why I care about the Family Care Act is that we have tended more away from the fundamentals of health care towards what I call political posturing. I do not want to get into who is doing it and to what extent, but I think most people will agree there is a lot of political posturing occurring. 
   I am hopeful we will pass a prescription drug benefit. I am not sure we will. I am hopeful we will pass Medicare reform. I do not think we will. I spent a year with the Medicare Reform Commission. It was quite an exercise in futility. There were a lot of negative feelings going back and forth. It was not the kind of commission or work with which one really wanted to be associated in terms of expanding health care. 
   This bill is not about posturing; it is about trying to eliminate the number of uninsured as much as we possibly can. 
   I still very much have on my mind the concept of universal health care. I understand that is not the top subject of the moment. We are at an incremental stage. If I can do things incrementally, then I will do that. If I have to wait some years for universal health care, then I will have to do that. I will always be pushing for universal health care, but I will take steps as we can take them, and this Family Care Act is a splendid way to do that. 
   One of the problems is that since President Clinton's health care bill did not pass--and I will not comment on that--there were 36 or 37 million people uninsured in the country, and there was disagreement as to the number. That is a lot of people. Now there are about 43 million to 44 million uninsured. One can extrapolate from that that we have been talking but not doing much about it. There have been a couple of instances where there has been bipartisan legislation which has passed and has helped, but nothing really substantial, and it has been very sporadic. 
   We are looking at a situation where, over the next 3 years, approximately 30 percent of the population, or about 81 million Americans, can expect to have no health insurance for at least 1 month out of a year. Who is to say when a problem might occur, when a leg might be broken, when a cancer may be discovered or when some other problem might arise? Basically, that to me is uninsurance. 
   Business people like to have predictability, and individuals like to have a sense of predictability: I have it; I am safe. That is why it is called the Health Security Act. Security is very important in health care. 
   Others would say let the market do that. The market has worked wonderfully in many ways in our country. It has had a lot to do with the success of our economy. It probably has had more to do with the success of our economy than the very Chairman of the Federal Reserve the Senator from Alabama was talking about a few moments ago. We are an entrepreneurial country, but we carry entrepreneurship to those places where we are quite certain it is going to work. 
   There are those who take risks, but basically Americans, when it comes to something such as health care, are rather risk averse, and therefore the whole concept of predictability and security once again becomes particularly important. 
   I am very unhappy when I think of 81 million Americans having at least 1 month out of the year without health insurance. I do not suspect the market is going to turn that around because it declined to. The Health Insurance Association of America, which is not a particularly aggressive group on health care, would agree with that statement. They do not want to get into that business of doing that kind of insurance. 
   The Family Care Act is a sensible Government approach in which we simply take the CHIP program, which is beginning to work now at a rapidly increasing rate as States grow more comfortable with it, and say let's extend that to the parents. That is called incrementalism. It is sensible. It fits within a pattern. It is logical, and it  also helps those who tend to be from the working poor. 
   I think we should do all we can to help people who are poor and who work and who choose not to go on welfare. 
   I think it is time to act. The family care amendment is not in any way political. It is not even large scale. But it does help. It is something that we will be voting on next week. With a strong degree of intensity, I encourage my colleagues to vote for it. 
   I thank the Presiding Officer and yield the floor.

   Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate has taken an important step toward protecting the lives and property of all Americans with the passage of the Firefighter Investment and Response Enhancement Act. I am proud today to join with Senators DODD and DEWINE as a cosponsor of this legislation. I wish to thank Senator DODD and Senator DEWINE for the leadership and effort they have shown on behalf of the men and women serving as firefighters across the nation. I would also like to commend the many other Senators who already have signed on as cosponsors of this important legislation. 
   The Firefighter Investment and Response Enhancement Act seeks to address the enormous amount of fiscal need faced by our nation's fire departments, both paid and volunteer, and does so with an eye to the human costs incurred by both firefighters and the general public these brave men and women protect every day. Every year, more than 4,000 people are killed and 24,000 are injured by fire in the United States. Sadly, about 660 of those killed each year are children. One hundred of the individuals who lose their lives to fire each year are firefighters, the very men and women who are fighting to protect others. Many of these deaths and injuries could be avoided by simply using the technology and equipment that while currently available, is often so expensive that fire departments are unable to purchase it. Similarly, many of the deaths and injuries could be avoided with increased efforts at fire prevention and training. Fire departments in many of our towns and cities spend the bulk of their entire budgets on administrative costs and compliance with existing safety regulations, and can simply not afford the available safety equipment and training. As a consequence, far too many volunteer firefighters and EMTs are forced to pay for their own training because their departments simply do not have enough money to have them trained. 
   West Virginia fire departments share in this enormous need for additional funding. There are about 16,000 firefighters in West Virginia serving in 437 fire departments. Virtually every one of those departments are underfunded. West Virginians were forced to cope with almost $73 million of property damage due to fires in 1999. More importantly, 45 civilians were killed and two firefighters were killed in the line of duty. Much of the loss of life and property, and many of these injuries could have been avoided if fire departments had the funds to deal with emergencies as effectively as possible and to establish prevention programs. 
   Over the past few months, my state has grieved the tragic loss of two firefighters whose deaths may well have been prevented if their departments had access to grants available under S. 1941. Angelo ``Wayne'' Shrader, a firefighter with the East River Volunteer  Fire Department, in Princeton, WV, who also worked as a Communicator with the Mercer County ``911'' service, died as a result of injuries incurred fighting a fire as part of an understaffed local fire department. Similarly, Fire Lieutenant Robbie Brannon, of the City of Bluefield Fire Department, died as the result of injuries, including a heart attack, he suffered fighting a residential fire with a crew short 
   two firefighters because of budget constraints. I humbly join with colleagues on both sides of the aisle today in honor of the bravery and sacrifice of Wayne Shrader and Robbie Brannon, and the many firefighters in West Virginia and across the nation who continue to protect us each day. 
   Like fire departments all across the country, West Virginia fire departments do receive support from State and local governments. Unfortunately, it is simply not enough. Indeed, fire departments in West Virginia are just like those in every other state, with equipment and personnel needs requiring substantial additional funding. Equipment such as thermal imaging cameras would be a tremendous aid to firefighters and could result in lives being saved, but such equipment is very expensive. Similarly, new and technologically advanced fire engines would be an enormous help to fire departments and the towns and cities they serve. Unfortunately, with current funding levels, most fire departments cannot upgrade their equipment and many must raise funds themselves just to fuel the antiquated vehicles many must still keep in service. 
   However, the greatest need fire departments in West Virginia have is the need for increased training. Additional training would be an invaluable resource to fire departments across the state. There simply is not enough money available. Three years ago, the projected five-year need for the fire departments in Raleigh County, West Virginia, alone was $14 million. While the Firefighter Investment and Response Enhancement Act would not cover that entire need, it would be a tremendous aid to fire departments as they attempt to meet their various needs. 
   For many years, fire departments and firefighters across the nation have simply dealt with funding shortfalls, and yet have managed to protect our communities despite the limited resources available to them. However, we cannot expect these miracles to be performed any longer. Bake sales and bingo can only pay for so much. It is vital that the federal government become involved. The men and women serving as firefighters play an important role in the quality of life in our communities, and it is high time Congress recognizes their contribution. It is our responsibility to provide adequate funding sources to keep firefighters from facing dangers that could be mitigated or eliminated though better training, the availability of state-of-the-art equipment, and the implementation of fire prevention programs. 
   The Firefighter Investment and Response Enhancement Act provides a portion of this much-needed relief. The legislation authorizes $1 billion to be distributed by FEMA to fire departments across the nation on a competitive basis. No more than ten percent of this money is to be used for administrative costs. This assures that the money is really getting to the fire departments that so desperately need help. Further, at least ten percent of the funds are to be used to establish vital fire prevention programs to stop fires before they start. The remaining appropriations will be available on a competitive basis to address a wide variety of needs faced by fire departments across the nation. This allows money to be used for the most desperate needs of individual departments. 
   It is past time that we provide some relief to our nation's brave firefighters who have managed to get by on far too little for far too long. Once again, I commend the Senate for taking this action on behalf of our nation's firefighters. I also wish to thank Senator DODD and Senator DEWINE for sponsoring this legislation to supply a portion of that much-needed aid. Little that we do may be as immediately important as the help we should act quickly to provide our fire departments. By helping our nation's fire departments, we are truly helping everyone.

   Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, in 1994 we passed the original Violence Against Women Act, creating programs that addressed the many forms of domestic violence all-too prevalent in the United States today. The bill helped communities create shelters, build partnerships among law enforcement agencies to respond to violence against women, and provide legal assistance to battered women. The bill also established a domestic violence hotline that receives hundreds of calls daily from people concerned about violence in their families. Now, we have the opportunity and responsibility to reauthorize this legislation to give women and children a way out of violent and unhealthy situations. 
   For groups that strive to combat domestic violence, the original Violence Against Women Act was a turning point in their battle. In my state, the West Virginia Coalition Against Domestic Violence stands as an outstanding example of the great work that groups devoted to the noble cause of stamping out domestic violence can do when Congress acts appropriately. With the added funding provided by the Violence Against Women Act, the Coalition was able to quadruple its staff, increase the budgets of its shelters to  meet their day-to-day needs, and increase services to under-served parts of the population of West Virginia. Many of the women who escape from violent homes cannot afford legal services, but thanks to grants authorized under the Violence Against Women Act, thirteen civil legal assistance programs are now in place around West Virginia providing free representation for women. 
   The Coalition also computerized its entire network, enabling instant communication with offices in other parts of rural West Virginia. By creating a database that compiles information on offenders from all over the state, they were able to work with regional jails, sheriffs, and other law enforcement agencies to use this valuable resource. I am proud to say that several other states have used West Virginia's system as a model, helping to combat domestic violence within their borders. 
   Passing the Violence Against Women Act of 2000 not only sustains existing programs, but creates several new initiatives that extend help to different groups and communities. The bill establishes a new formula for calculating some of the grants, enabling small states like West Virginia to continue to expand their services. In addition, it augments current policies with protections for older and disabled women, and builds on legal assistance programs to further expand coverage. 
   Perhaps most importantly, the passage of this legislation conveys the important message that the federal government considers domestic violence to be a serious issue. Those of us in Congress share in this concern with the people we serve. We can take some pride that by acting to address these problems, we may have moved some State governments to improve their services to abused spouses and children, and to increase the penalties meted out to the abusers. 
   By paying attention to this enormously important issue, and by enhancing the current legislation, we are taking steps in the right direction. Although the measures in the original legislation have helped to alleviate the problem, we must continue to wage a persistent fight as long as anyone feels unsafe in their homes.

   Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I am proud to be joined by Senators JEFFORDS and BREAUX in introducing the Tax Relief for Working Families Act of 2000. This bipartisan bill is designed to strengthen the effectiveness of the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) in reducing child poverty and promoting work. 
   Our bill will increase the EITC for families with three or more children. Families could qualify for almost an additional $500. Obviously, raising a large family costs more, and these families have a higher poverty rate of 29 percent, more than double the poverty rate of children in smaller families. Nearly three out of every five poor children live in families with three or more children. 
   A report by the Committee for Economic Development found that the ``EITC has become a powerful force in dramatically raising the employment of low-income women in recent years.'' The report also recommended further expansions of the EITC. Since research shows that larger families have greater problems leaving welfare for work, this legislation should build upon our welfare reform efforts. 
   But even more compelling than national statistics are the real stories from West Virginia families. One woman in Huntington, West Virginia is struggling to raise five daughters and care for her husband who was disabled in a roofing accident. That family is managing on approximately $13,000 a year. She works the night shift, but must currently rely on the public bus. Her shift begins at midnight, but the last bus is at 9:00 p.m. so she takes the earlier bus, and spends several hours waiting for her shift instead of having time with her family. Last year, she used the EITC to pay her bills, including a winter coat for one of her daughters. With an increase, she hopes to save for a used car. 
   Another West Virginia mother is recently divorced and struggling to raise four sons, ranging in age from sixteen to seven. Her 16-year-old son has Downs Syndrome. Last year she earned $13,800 and she used her EITC to purchase a used van so she would have reliable transportation for her 50-mile commute to work. Another year, the EITC helped pay for new mattresses for her children's beds. With an increase, she'd like to save a little money in case of an emergency or for better housing. 
   These are real stories of real families who are working hard to make ends meet but need and deserve more help. 
   This is a bipartisan bill. We have closely consulted with leading groups like the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, Catholic Charities U.S.A., the United Way of America, and the Progressive Policy Institute. 
   In addition to increasing the EITC available to large families, our bill includes several bipartisan provisions to simplify the credit by conforming the definition of earned income and simplifying the definition of a dependent child. 
   Some may question the cost of expanding the EITC, but I believe, compared to other tax proposals such as providing additional marriage tax relief, investing an additional $8 billion over the next five years is a reasonable investment to help low-wage working families. Most of these families are married. All are struggling, but working hard to do the right thing for their children. In its letter supporting our efforts, Catholic Charities U.S.A. describes our legislation is ``pro-family, pro-marriage, and pro-work.'' 
   During the 1998 tax year, over 19 million working Americans got $30.5 billion in tax relief, thanks to the EITC. In my state, about 141,000 West Virginians claimed $210.7 million. About nineteen percent of West Virginia taxpayers benefit from the EITC. In my state, 84 percent of taxpayers earn less than $50,000. I believe that this legislation to expand the EITC for families with three or more children will help more West Virginians than many of the other, more expensive provisions under consideration as part of the marriage penalty relief debate. 
   We know that the EITC works. It encourages work, and it helps lift families out of poverty. I urge my colleagues to join with Senators JEFFORDS and BREAUX to help hard working families raise their children.

   Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Madam President, yesterday was the 50th anniversary of the beginning of the Korean War, an often overlooked, yet very important event in history. ``Forgotten'' is a term used too often about the Korean War; for veterans and their families, the war is very real, and something they can never forget. 
   Officially, the war was the first military effort of the United Nations, but American involvement was dominant throughout the conflict. Thousands of Americans traveled to a distant land to help defend the rights of strangers threatened by hostile invasion. Unfortunately, many who fought bravely to aid the Koreans lost their lives while waging the war. 
   Today, I want to pay homage to all who served in this war. The troops from the United States and the 20 other United Nations countries who provided aid to the South Koreans deserve our great acclaim every day, but even more so on this special anniversary. These great countries united to preserve the rights of South Korea, a small democracy threatened by the overwhelming power of the Communist government. South Korea did not have sufficient military resources to protect its interests. Fortunately, the United Nations member countries were not about to sit back and watch North Korea, with the aid of China and the Soviet Union, annihilate the democracy in the south. 
   On June 25, 1950, troops from Communist-ruled North Korea invaded South Korea, meeting little resistance to their attack. A few days later, on the morning of July 5th--still Independence Day in the United States--Private Kenny Shadrick of Skin Fork, West Virginia, became the war's first American casualty. Kenny was the first, but many more West Virginians were destined to die in the conflict--in fact, more West Virginians were killed in combat during the three years of the Korean War than during the 10 years that we fought in Vietnam. In one of the bloodiest wars in history, 36,940 more Americans would lose their lives before it was all over. In addition, more than 8,000 Americans are still missing in action and unaccounted for. 
   Five years ago, we dedicated the Korean War Memorial on the Mall in Washington, DC. This stirring tribute to the veterans of this war poignantly symbolizes the hardships of the conflict. 
   The Memorial depicts, with stainless steel statues, a squad of 19 soldiers on patrol. The ground on which they advance is reminiscent of the rugged Korean terrain that they encountered, and their wind-blown ponchos depict the treacherous weather that ensued throughout the war. Our soldiers landed in South Korea poorly equipped to face the icy temperatures of 30 degrees below zero, their weaponry outdated and inadequate. As a result of the extreme cold, many veterans still suffer today from cold-related injuries, including frostbite, cold sensitization, numbness, tingling and burning, circulatory problems, skin cancer, fungal infections, and arthritis. Furthermore, the psychological tolls of war have caused great hardship for many veterans.  
   As a background to the soldiers' statues at the Memorial, the images of 2,400 unnamed men and women stand etched into a granite wall, symbolizing the determination of the United States workforce and the millions of family members and friends who supported the efforts of those at war. Looking at the steadfast, resolute faces of these individuals invokes in the viewer a deep admiration and appreciation for their importance to the war effort. 
   Author James Brady, a veteran of the Korean War, spoke for all those who served in the war when he wrote, ``We were all proudly putting our lives on the line for our country. But I would later come to realize that the Korean War was like the middle child in a family, falling between World War II and Vietnam. It became an overlooked war.'' Mr. Brady conveys the sentiments of many of the veterans who served in this war and underscores our need to give these veterans the recognition they are long overdue. 
   Today, I salute the courage of those who stood up for democracy while fighting for the freedom of strangers. Through their unselfish display of determination and valor in the battles they endured, they sent an important message to future generations. I thank our Korean War veterans; their bravery reminds us of the value we put on freedom, while their sacrifices remind us that, as it says at the Korean War Memorial, ``Freedom is not free.''

   Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I thank the Presiding Officer and the Senator from Virginia. 
   This is really a moral issue, and the question is, Are we going to do it? We keep putting it off. We keep talking about it. We keep saying, let's have a commission, let's do a resolution, let's study it some more, let's make the process work perfectly. 
   I spent most of the afternoon in the Finance Committee trying to work out a resolution on this. Frankly, at the end, there was some hope. But there was also some discussion about what happens if we don't get to vote on prescription drugs. There was a discussion of that. 
   I don't want to see that happen. This will probably be our only vote on prescription drugs in this entire session. It is a bipartisan bill. I have made some compromises. Others have made compromises. It is a solid bill. It is probably the only vote we will have on it. 
   It is a moral issue, not a political issue, a moral issue that seniors don't have prescription drugs under Medicare. They ought to. JOHN BREAUX is right: Prescription drugs are like a bed in a hospital in 1965; now we are going to modernize it, it is available for all. 
   It is an amendment we should pass. It is a moral, not a political, issue. This will probably be the only vote on prescription drugs we will have in this session of the Senate.

    Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, today Senator KENNEDY and a bipartisan coalition are introducing the National and Community Service Amendments Act of 2000 to strengthen this program of community service throughout our country. I am proud to be an original cosponsor of this bill because I know how public service has enriched my life. As elected representatives, we are entrusted with preserving the strong democracy and just society that our founders envisioned. The programs supported by this legislation, such as AmeriCorps, extend the opportunity to young people to do something for others. 
   While working in the Peace Corps, at an Asian desk, I was motivated to accept the challenge made by president Kennedy and I joined VISTA. Through VISTA, I came to West Virginia and a ``coal camp,'' a small, struggling town called Emmons. Working to improve life in Emmons was not easy. But after a lot of effort, I was able to both make friends and work to make some kind of difference. We pulled down an abandoned school house in southern West Virginia and hauled the boards back to Emmons, where we built a community center. We brought a mobile health van for women to get Pap smears for the first time. And we waged a long, hard fight to get the school bus to stop close enough so the teenagers did not have to drop out of school just because the transportation to high school did not exist. Those two years in Emmons, and the experiences gained there, changed me forever. I stayed in West Virginia and chose to make public service my career. 
   When President Clinton chose to unveil a new domestic civil-service program in 1993, I was proud to stand by him as he announced the creation of AmeriCorps in Princeton, New Jersey. AmeriCorps is an exciting program promoting community service, like VISTA. Under AmeriCorps, members invest their time in community service and earn educational awards that help finance college or pay back student loans. 
   Since its inception just a few years ago, AmeriCorps has renewed community service across our nation with a network of programs designed to meet the specific needs of an area. In West Virginia, AmeriCorps has established more than a half dozen programs that help children learn how to read, provide them with caring mentors, and promote healthy lifestyles. 
   In highlighting a few of these programs, I must begin with the AmeriCorps Promise Fellows. These individuals service eighteen West Virginia counties, striving to mobilize  communities to provide children with resources critical to their development. In the same way that I helped the community of Emmons build a center where young people could learn and play, AmeriCorps Promise Fellows work to establish safe places and structured activities in their local areas. Another program, Energy Express, provides balanced meals, an environment that abounds with literature, and the attention of mentors to school-aged children during the summer months. I visited the Energy Express site in Pineville, West Virginia, and read to children there. AmeriCorps programs also aid adult members of the community, as evidenced by the success of Project MOVE in west-central West Virginia that strives to move people from welfare to work. After the first year, the heads of households in twenty families had become employed and had sustained themselves for more than three months. 
   These three programs are just a sampling of what AmeriCorps does in a rural state like West Virginia. In more urban areas throughout the country, AmeriCorps has programs that address the unique needs of those cities and their populace. 
   I place an enormous value on public service, and I know that I gained much from my VISTA experience in Emmons. Continuing AmeriCorps, VISTA and our range of community service programs will enhance the lives of Americans, young and old, who join and enrich our communities.

   Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I believe it is vital to make a clear statement against all violent hate crimes against individuals because of race, color, religion, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, or disability. This is a basic point, and the number of hate crimes in our country is truly disturbing. When such a case claims headlines and dominates national news for a few days or a few weeks, people are troubled and sad. But we can and we should do more to oppose hate crimes. 
   My hope is that having leaders at all levels, including the U.S. Senate, speak against such hate crimes will send a powerful message that such violent behavior should not be tolerated. No one in our country should be afraid of violence because of their race, religion, color, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, or disability. When such crimes occur, families are devastated and entire communities are stunned and hurt. 
   In addition to sending a strong message, the Kennedy amendment would offer federal help to combat violent hate crimes, including up to $100,000 in  federal grants to state and local law enforcement officials to cover the expenses of investigating and prosecuting such crimes. Federal grants would also encourage cooperation and coordination with the community groups and schools that could be affected. The bipartisan Kennedy amendment is a balanced attempt to combat hate crimes by helping state and local officials.

    Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, today we celebrate West Virginia's 137th year as a state. West Virginia joined the Union in the midst of the Civil War when President Lincoln admitted it to the Union as the 35th state on June 20, 1863. 
   The spirit of pride and determination that gave the first West Virginians the courage to start anew can still be seen in the ever-innovative and evolving ways that West Virginians have adapted to changing economics and culture. This is apparent in the transitions of the coal and steel industries as well as in the increasing cultivation of the tourism industry. However, through the continual change, West Virginians have held a heritage that remains rich in song, craft, and tradition. It is as visible at the State Fair of West Virginia in Lewisburg, the Appalachian Heritage Festival in Shepherdstown, and the Tamarack Arts Center in Beckley as it is at Bob's Grocery in Lindside. The state has an abundance of coal, steel, forests, rivers, and mountains, but her greatest resource has always been her people. 
   This natural charm of West Virginians is reflected in the scenic treasures that crown the state. Though born during a time of turmoil, present-day West Virginia is an emblem of peace and tranquility. Ernest W. James captured it perfectly: 
 There autumn hillsides are bright with scarlet trees; And in the spring, the robins sing, While apple blossoms whisper in the breeze And where the sun draws rainbows in the mist of waterfalls and mountain rills, My heart will be always in the West Virginia hills.  
   So on this, West Virginia's 137th birthday, I am enormously proud to invite my colleagues to join me in recognizing and celebrating this West Virginia Day.

   Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, recently my colleagues, Senators GRASSLEY, KENNEDY, JEFFORDS, and HARKIN introduced The Family Opportunity Act of 2000. I have proudly signed on to this important piece of legislation which will help hundreds of thousands of American families who have children with disabilities get access to Medicaid as well as obtain much needed support and information. 
   The Family Opportunity Act is modeled after last year's successful Work Incentives Improvement Act, which assures adults with disabilities can return to work and not risk losing their health care coverage. This new Act would create a state option to allow middle-income parents who have a child with special health needs to keep working, while having an option to buy in to Medicaid coverage for their child. 
   In my own state of West Virginia, over 50,000 children are known to have a disability. I have heard personally from many of these families, who remind me about their daily struggles of sacrificing time, energy, and finances to provide the best environment for their child. In the past, this has meant that parents often refuse jobs, pay raises and overtime just to keep their incomes low enough so that they can qualify for services under Medicaid for their children with special health care needs. 
   Medicaid coverage is so crucial to the child because many private plans do not offer essential services such as occupational, physical and speech therapy, mental health services, home and community-based services, and durable medical equipment such as walkers and wheelchairs, which if uncovered, can be financially devastating to a family. Under the Family Opportunity Act, families would be required to first take employer-sponsored health coverage if available. The option to buy in to Medicaid would be used as a supplement to existing private insurance or as stand alone coverage if employer-based coverage were not an option. 
   In addition to creating Medicaid buy-in options for families, the Family Opportunity Act proposes the establishment of Family to Family Health Information Centers. These Centers, staffed by both parents and professionals would be available to help families identify and access appropriate health care for their children with special needs, as well as answer questions on filling out the necessary paperwork to establish health care coverage. 
   The Family Opportunity Act promises to promote early intervention, ensures medically necessary services, offers support, and will help restore family stability. I applaud my colleagues for proposing this important legislation, but even more important, I give a standing ovation to the dedicated families who give so greatly of themselves to care for their children.

    Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I come to the floor to urge the passage of the Domenici, Bingaman and Burns amendment to the Department of Transportation Appropriations Act, Senate Amendment 3432. This amendment appropriates $20 million for grants supporting the Small Community Air Service Development Pilot program, properly targeting necessary funding to needy small airports. 
   When I became Ranking Member of the Aviation Subcommittee, I was determined to make support of small airports a priority. This March, I helped craft the Wendell H. Ford Aviation and Reform Act of the 21st Century (FAIR-21), the Federal Aviation Administration and the Airport Improvement Program bill authorizing $40 billion for aviation funding, the largest increase in aviation funding ever. This included significant new funding for rural airports. In 1998, I had authored the Air Service Restoration Act, directing the Department of Transportation to make new priorities and incentives supporting the development of airports in small communities, which was incorporated into FAIR-21. The Domenici-Bingaman-Burns amendment builds on these efforts and makes the proposed funding a reality. 
   The Domenici-Bingaman-Burns amendment provides the funding small  airports need. Small airports are an essential part of our aviation infrastructure. Without improvements to our small airports, we will stymy the economic growth of less developed areas. We know transportation is vital to economic development and that improving air transportation needs more Congressional attention. Senator DOMENICI sponsored this amendment with Senators BURNS and BINGAMAN and made it a priority and possible. But I would like to especially note the work of my good friend and respected colleague, Senator BINGAMAN, who deserves tremendous credit for his assiduous efforts to make sure this funding is available. I wholeheartedly endorse this amendment and urge its adoption as part of the Department of Transportation Appropriation Act.

   Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Massachusetts. I thank the Presiding Officer. 
   The American Medical Association says:  
   The AMA strongly supports attaching the Norwood-Dingell patients' of rights bill to the DOD reauthorization bill. Patients and physicians have worked for more than half a decade on a bill that protects patients. Now is the time to make it law.  
   They further say:  
   The Republican counterproposal put forward on June 4 was unacceptable making it little better than the HMO protection act passed by the Senate last summer. The bill was a sham.  
   That is the American Medical Association. 
   I listened to my colleagues, all of whom I have enormous affection for, and they know I respect them. I work with them on many things. As they describe the conference process, I can't really believe what I am hearing, because I have been in that conference. What I am hearing on the floor and what I heard in the conference is two entirely different worlds. 
   I would like to expand on that, but I don't have the time. But we have asked for proposals. We haven't gotten proposals. We should not be in the business of suing HMOs or corporations. We said we wouldn't do that. Senator KENNEDY said it many times. Congressman DINGELL said it many times. If you want to write the language which says that corporations cannot be sued under this bill, we will accept the language. We don't want to sue corporations unless they themselves intervene in the decision which produces death or injury. 
   What could be clearer than that? 
   To listen to the argument from this side, one would think it was something entirely different. This is reduced to a political discussion. As Democrats, we feel passionately about the Patients' Bill of Rights and want 161 million Americans or more to be covered by this, rather than the 48 million which would be covered by the present Senate bill. We want them, first, to have coverage if the bill passes; and second, if the bill doesn't pass, to know so that there could be created a ground swell for future action over who is accountable. It is accountability not only for HMOs, but it is accountability for Congresspeople on both sides. 
   Our Patients' Bill of Rights--basically, the one that has been introduced which I urge my colleague to support--is incredibly sound and sensible. It gives people the kind of protection they want. 
   Senator FRIST understands well that a child needs a pediatric cardiologist; an adult needs an adult cardiologist. An adult's fist is not the same as a child's fist. They require different kinds of surgery. In the bill the other side proposes, that would not be possible. They could not go out of their plan to get that kind of help. In our bill they could. 
   That is an example of the kind of attention we placed in this amendment. 
   I urge my colleagues to support the bill we have before the Senate. It is much better for the American people.

   Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, today I gladly lend my support to the Alternative Fuels Tax Incentives Act being introduced by Senator JEFFORDS, along with Senators HATCH, ROBB, KERRY, BRYAN, and CHAFEE. I join with my colleagues because of my longstanding dedication to increasing the use of alternative fuels for transportation, and my understanding that to do so we must stimulate interest in the still fledgling alternative fuel vehicle industry. The success of this industry, and the acceptance of these vehicles in the market place, is critical to lowering our dependence on imported oil, improving the quality of the air we breathe, and reducing the greenhouse gases our nation emits. 
   Let me take a few moments to relate some of the reasons why it is so important that we reduce our consumption of petroleum and use alternative sources of energy. The first and most tangible reason is the need to reduce our nation's dependence on foreign oil. Currently, we import more than half of the oil consumed in this nation. That translates to $180,000 per minute that is being spent to purchase foreign oil. That's bad for our balance of trade, but more important, none of us want to continue to have our energy costs fluctuate and spike at the whim of OPEC or any other foreign organization. The recent price increase shows just how important this is, and how vulnerable we are. 
   A second reason is that it is critical that we reduce the transportation sector's negative impact on air quality. While the automobile industry has made great strides in reducing the emissions of cars and trucks, the improvement has been largely offset by the dramatically increasing number of miles these vehicles are driven each year, and by our increasing desire for larger, more powerful vehicles. In 1980, light trucks, a category that includes minivans and SUVs, accounted for only 19.9 percent of the U.S. automobile market. Traditionally, these vehicles have been exempted from corporate average fuel economy (CAFE) standards. In the past couple of years, some in Congress have been successful in blocking any adjustment to CAFE standards, including the inclusion of SUVs and minivans. Now the reason for including them is even more obvious. By 1998, these larger vehicles accounted for 47.5 percent of the automobile market, with SUVs alone accounting for 18.1 percent. Clearly, doing something to cut air pollution and to reduce greenhouse gas emissions will require an enormous change in our transportation sector. 
   Because I believe it is the right thing to do for the people of West Virginia, and for the nation as a whole, I have been a long-time supporter of research into, incentives for, and commercial implementation of alternative fuel technologies. During my first term in the United States Senate, I introduced the Alternative Motor Vehicle Act of 1988. That legislation has been credited with a dramatic increase in the production of alternatively fueled vehicles,  notably the so-called flexibly-fueled vehicles, which run on either alternative fuels or gasoline. In fact, 500,000 of the 17 million cars sold in the United States in 1999 were flexible-fuel vehicles. In 1992, when Congress passed the 
   Energy Policy Act (EPAct), I authored and supported a number of provisions in that law to promote the use of alternatively-fueled and electric vehicles through tax credits for vehicle purchase and installation of supporting infrastructure. 
   Finally, just over a year ago, along with my colleagues Senators HATCH, CRAPO, and BRYAN, I introduced the Alternative Fuels Promotion Act, S. 1003. Both the Alternative Fuels Tax Incentives Act introduced today, and the Alternative Fuels Promotion Act introduced last year, would provide the alternative fuel vehicle industry some of the help it needs to begin to get a sustainable foothold in the market place. While these bills differ in the size and type of tax incentives, I strongly believe that both bills are appropriate steps toward a cleaner environment and a more energy independent nation. 
   As I have stated on the Floor of the Senate before, the options for bringing about change in the transportation sector are somewhat limited. Congress could impose new taxes, mandates, or regulations. However, these approaches are sometimes unpopular with both the American people and our colleagues in Congress. I believe the best way to bring about the change we need is to provide incentives for manufacturers to develop and sell clean technology and for consumers to buy and use this technology. I believe that the Alternative Fuels Tax Incentives Act being introduced today offers manufacturers and consumers these necessary incentives. 
   Our domestic automobile manufacturers have developed a number of clean-running and efficient vehicles. These vehicles are virtually indistinguishable from their gasoline-powered counterparts in terms of performance, safety, and comfort. However, there are still two major barriers to widespread acceptance. The first is cost. Though manufacturers have made great strides in reducing the cost of these vehicles, most, including those powered by natural gas, propane, methanol, and electricity, are still significantly more expensive than their gasoline-powered counterparts. 
   A second critical roadblock impeding acceptance of alternatively fueled vehicles is the lack of an adequate refueling infrastructure. I received a call a few months ago from a woman who had just purchased a compressed natural gas-powered car made by a domestic manufacturer. Her entire car pool loved the car, especially the absence of any ``exhaust smell'' when you stood behind the car. She was calling to find out if we could help her locate more places to fuel it. She lives in Boston, and knew of only three fueling stations within a reasonable driving area. If this is the case in a major metropolitan area--which has a significant number of compressed natural gas-powered fleets in operation--it is clear that we have a long way to go. The Alternative Fuels Promotion Act offers strong incentives aimed at minimizing these roadblocks. 
   We know that when national policy supports the creative energies and potential of the private sector, progress is made at a faster rate. The private sector is leading the way in developing alternative fuel vehicle technology. We need to provide consumers with a strong financial incentive to use this technology. Certainly, our continued dependence on foreign oil and the contribution of conventionally-powered vehicles to air pollution--including greenhouse gases--compels us to try. I encourage my colleagues to take a hard look at our environment and our national energy security, and to pass the Alternative Fuels Tax Incentives Act during this Congress.

    Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, today I would like to recognize and celebrate the recent expansion of K.S. of West Virginia. It seems like just a short time ago, in August of 1995 to be precise, that I had the privilege of announcing that this Japan-based company would be moving to Ravenswood, West Virginia. 
   Remarkable things have happened since that day almost five years ago. At that time, just two Japanese firms called West Virginia home. Today, I am honored to say that seventeen Japanese companies are thriving in our state, creating good paying jobs that support both families and communities. 
   K.S. of West Virginia has played an important role in that success, and I would like to personally extend my gratitude to the Kato family for their unwavering support and belief in us. Our efforts in Japan would surely suffer were it not for the positive voices of our friends here at K.S. Indeed, Mr. Kato's enthusiasm and excitement about West Virginia is unmistakable and contagious. West Virginia has found a valuable ally and a good friend in Mr. Kazuo Kato, and his tireless work continues to be appreciated. 
   Too often in this country we have witnessed the destruction of families and whole communities as the result of the corporate philosophy of the bottom line. However, companies like K.S. of West Virginia, who recognize the importance of their employees and communities, demonstrate that compassion and sound judgement are the real keys to success. K.S. is an example of the kind of company that truly deserves our praise and support. 
   There is no clearer example of this than an issue Mr. Kato and I have been working on over the past year. As the leader of K.S., Mr. Kato faced a difficult situation with costly ramifications. Yet, instead of maintaining the status quo, Mr. Kato made a series of innovative decisions that will have far-reaching effects for both K.S., and the U.S. steel industry. 
   Not only a leader in the business world, K.S. has shown leadership in the West Virginia community, as well. Companies like K.S., who believe that their success is measured not just by overall profit margins, but by the amount that is shared with the people who make them profitable, teach us a valuable lesson in management, ethics, team work and mutual respect. This philosophy is as ancient as Confucius or the Bible, and as relevant as the news you read in this morning's paper. 
   Indeed, there are 115 individuals who have contributed to the prosperity of K.S. of West Virginia. Their hard work is not taken for granted, and as this company grows, so does the value of their loyalty. We are blessed in West Virginia to have parents and grandparents who taught their children that by working hard and playing by the rules a person can be successful--each employee at K.S is a reflection of this tradition and a credit to our State. 
   As part of his core teaching, Confucius emphasized that people in positions of leadership have a sacred obligation to serve those who have entrusted them with power. If this power is abused, then the entire system would break down, dooming any enterprise. Thus, I am proud to add my voice to the collective celebration of the success we are witnessing at K.S. of West Virginia. To Mr. Kato and his family, and all the members of K.S. of West Virginia, I extend my thanks and congratulations. You have demonstrated that by working together, unattainable dreams can become reality.

   Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I am proud today to recognize and welcome the visit to Washington, DC by a group of my fellow West Virginians for this Sunday's ``Million Mom March.'' 
   The Million Mom March, coinciding with Mothers' Day, is a grassroots effort led by people across the country--Dads and Kids included--dedicated to educating our children and our nation about guns; both the dangers posed by their misuse and the tragic toll this misuse has taken on our country's youth, their friends, and their families. The people who attend this event here in Washington will have gathered in the parking lots of schools, churches, and synagogues across the country, and will have come here to let those of us in Congress know, in no uncertain terms, that we need to be doing more to protect our children. 
   I am pleased to say that among those relaying that message this weekend will be a delegation of Moms from West Virginia, many with their entire families in tow. As they point out, one difference many of these West Virginian Moms may have from others participating in this weekend's events is that they also have hunters in their own families. In fact, it would not surprise me at all to find out that more than a few of the folks marching were hunters themselves. 
   In West Virginia, we respect the rights of law-abiding citizens to keep and bear arms, and we consider parents and children hunting together to be a time-honored tradition. Yet our state legislature has already taken the responsible step of limiting possession and legal ownership of handguns to those 18 and older. Now the West Virginian Moms join with their counterparts from around the nation to demand that Members of Congress respond appropriately to the epidemic of American children killed and injured by accidents and crime involving guns. 
   Unfortunately, all too often when we in Congress discuss the misuse of guns, the debate turns into a pointless back-and-forth about whether we have too many gun laws, or too few. Rather than engage in that debate, I would just invite my colleagues to consider these staggering statistics: 
   One in 910 American children die because of the misuse of guns before the age of 20. 
   American children under the age of 15 are twelve times more likely to die from gunfire than children in 25 other industrialized countries combined. 
   Seventy-seven percent of murder victims aged 13-17 are killed by a firearm. 
   Last year: 
   4,205 children and teens were killed by gunfire; 
   2,562 were murdered by gunfire; 
   1,262 committed suicide using a firearm; and 
   306 died from an accidental shooting. 
   Each day: 
   Two children under the age of 5 are murdered; 
   Six children and youths under 20 commit suicide; 
   Ten children and youths under 20 are homicide victims; and 
   Twelve children and youth under 20 die from firearm misuse. 
   Between 1979 and 1997, gunfire killed nearly 80,000 children and teens in America--25,000 more than the total number of American soldiers killed in battle in Vietnam. 
   Firearms wounded an additional 320,000 children during this same period. 
   In that period, more than 25,000 children took their own lives with firearms, and nearly 10,000 died as a result of an accidental shooting. 
   In 1997, my home state of West Virginia lost 23 children younger than 20 to firearm misuse, up seven from the previous year. Nine were murdered, ten committed suicide, and three were the victims of accidents. 
   Mr. President, last year the United States Senate passed the Juvenile Justice bill. Among its provisions, this bill contained some courageous efforts to address the culture of crime and violence in which our children are being raised. The bill also featured some common-sense measures designed to make guns safer, and provisions to keep firearms out of the hands of criminals. The Senate also sought to close the so-called gun show loophole. Sadly, our seeming inability to have any discussion about guns has kept the conferees on this bill from reporting back to the respective houses with a version for final passage. 
   My purpose here today is to join the Million Moms in calling attention to the bottom line. We live in a society in which the lives of children are tragically at risk because of the virtually unfettered availability of guns. Our respect for the constitutional rights of gun owners should never overwhelm the love and caring we have for our children. I commend the Moms, from West Virginia and around the country, who come to remind us what our priorities should be.

    Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, on behalf of myself and Senator MURRAY, I wish to introduce a bill, the Children of Women Vietnam Veterans' Benefits Act of 2000, which would amend title 38, United States Code, to provide compensation and benefits to children born with certain birth defects to women Vietnam veterans. 
   This bill is essentially similar, except for minor technical corrections, to S. 2494, the Children of Female Vietnam Veterans' Benefits Act of 2000, which I introduced on May 2, 2000. Mrs. MURRAY had asked to be an original cosponsor of that bill, but through an inadvertent clerical error, she was not listed as an original cosponsor on the bill when it was printed. I wish to note, for the record, that it was her intent to be an original cosponsor of S. 2494.

   Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation that will maintain the promised health benefits of a small group of retired coalminers and their widows--the  Coalminers and Widows Health Protection Act of 2000. Retired coalminers and their widows were promised lifetime health benefits by the companies they worked for and by the federal government more than a half century ago. This commitment goes back to 1946 when President Truman guaranteed miners they would have lifetime health benefits in exchange for their return to the mines. The promise was well understood in the coalfields, and reiterated in successive coal wage agreements throughout the last half century. Congress affirmed that promise when it enacted the Coal Industry Retiree Health Benefits Act in 1992 (as part of the Energy Policy Act) to protect the health benefits of about 120,000 retirees and avoid a nationwide coal strike. The Coal Act has ensured that a small group of retirees would continue to get the health benefits that they earned and were promised for eight years now. There are now only about 65,000 miners and retirees remaining in the Fund--70% of whom are elderly widows of retired miners. Their average age is 78 years old, and more than 45% of the population is over 80 years old. 
   Once again, in this new century, the health care of this small group of retired miners and widows is threatened due to both significantly increased health care costs and a series of adverse court decisions. Congress must act this year to prevent a reduction in their health care benefits. Last year, we faced the first shortfall in the trust fund that pays for retired miners health benefits, and Congress responded. Senator BYRD and Congressman RAHALL's leadership forestalled a health care benefit cut. They included a stop-gap $68 million in last year's final omnibus Appropriations bill to avert a cut. If Congress fails to act this year, retired miners and their widows will be in imminent danger of losing health benefits as early as next Spring. 
   I am glad to report to my colleagues that the Clinton/Gore Administration recognized the need to shore up the retired miners' health fund and included in its budget a number of provisions that together secure miners' benefits well into the next decade. The Coal Act related provisions in the President's budget are based on one premise--these retired miners were promised lifetime health benefits and a promise made must be a promise kept. The Administration strongly reaffirmed the federal government's commitment to retired miners and their widows by proposing to transfer $346 million in new monies over the next ten years to the Combined Benefit Fund to ensure there will be no benefit cuts. The Administration's budget also clarified a few provisions of the Coal Act to avoid unnecessary litigation about the clear meaning of the statute. The Coalminers and Widows Health Protection Act does not include all of the Administration's proposed solutions for jurisdictional and practical reasons, but I am very grateful for their comprehensive solution to maintaining promised benefits, and believe each of their proposed remedies deserve serious consideration by Congress. 
   The Coalminers and Widows Health Protection Act does three things. It provides for an annual mandatory transfer of general funds to the Combined Benefit Fund to maintain its long term solvency and prevent a reduction in miners' health benefits. The annual transfers are set at a level to avoid any reduction in benefits and amount to $346 million over ten years. This bill also clarifies two aspects of the Coal Act to resolve disputed or misunderstood provisions of the law. The first clarification involves the timing of Social Security Administration's assignment of retired miners to the companies that had employed them and promised to finance their lifetime health benefits. The second clarification involves assignments to successors-in-interest of coal companies that had agreed to finance lifetime health benefits, as well as to the successors-in-interest of persons related to those companies, which is explicitly provided for in the Act. These clarifications will avoid further unneeded litigation expenses. These two clarifications do not score for the purposes of determining the cost of enacting them to the federal government. 
   I want to report to my colleagues that there is a bipartisan, bicameral process underway to determine how we can best shore up the miners' trust fund. Staff are meeting regularly. Chairman ROTH has informed me that he is committed to finding a way to preserve these promised benefits, and I welcome his strong support, as well as that of Senator MOYNIHAN and several other Members of the Finance Committee who are actively involved in this process. 
   One hundred thousand coalminers were killed while working in the mines last century. Nearly another hundred thousand suffered debilitating job related illnesses. This bill will give retired miners and their widows the health security they were promised and deserve. We owe them that security. They earned it. And you can rest assured that as Congress deals with the priority issues of funding government functions and operations through the annual budget process, and as proposed tax cuts and other legislative items are contemplated, I intend to see to it that we meet our responsibilities to retired coalminers. 
   There are about 20,000 thousand retired miners and their widows living in West Virginia--and tens of thousands of more living in virtually every state of the Union. The Coalminers and Widows Health Protection Act will tell them that they can count on their health care benefits being there for them when they need them, just as they were promised.

   Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleagues in highlighting a powerful call to action on science and technology funding issued by our nation's high technology, academic, and labor leaders. 
   On March 22, 2000, forty-seven CEOs of high technology companies, Presidents of our leading universities, and representatives of labor organizations came together in an unprecedented Council on Competitiveness letter petitioning Congress for ``significantly higher long-term investments in our national science and technology enterprise.'' This investment, they stated, should come in the form of increased ``public-sector investments in frontier research'' such as research in the ``[p]hysical sciences, math, and engineering.'' This letter also includes a clear warning--Congressional failure to appropriate more funding for science and technology research will threaten America's competitive advantage in information technology, biotechnology, health science, new materials, and other critical technology-intensive fields. As we all know, many economists, including Alan Greenspan, have asserted that our country's leadership in these areas is an important reason for our current economic success. A refusal to support America's dominant position with adequate appropriations today threatens our economic success tomorrow. 
   The Council on Competitiveness letter also reveals that increased federal funding to science and technology will positively affect another key policy issue--the scarcity of technologically skilled workers. The debate over whether to raise the number of H1-B visas has alerted all of us to the technology industry's critical need for more highly skilled workers. In the New Economy large numbers of ``knowledge-based'' workers are essential to economic growth. Because we are not training enough American knowledge-based workers, high-tech companies have asked Congress to increase the number of H1-B visas granted to skilled workers who are willing to immigrate from other countries. 
   Appropriating more funding for science and technology research will increase the number of technologically trained Americans, thus addressing the current scarcity of knowledge-based workers. The letter explains that: ``Education and training of scientists and engineers are tied to federally sponsored research performed in the nation's laboratories and universities. When federal R&D commitments shrink, so too does the pool of technically trained talent, forcing industry and academia to look abroad for skilled knowledge workers.'' I therefore urge all my colleagues who support increasing the H1-B cap to support increased federal science and technology funding--we must develop more American technology workers. 
   It is important to understand that this letter's signatories are not alone in their recommendation for more substantial funding for science and technology research. The House Science Committee wisely wrote in a 1998 study titled ``Unlocking Our Future: Toward a New National Science Policy'' that ``[t]he federal investment in science has yielded stunning payoffs. It has spawned not only new products, but also entire industries. To build upon the strength of the research enterprise, we must make federal research funding stable and substantial, maintaining diversity in the federal research portfolio, and promoting creative, ground breaking research.'' 
   Similarly, a Business Week editorial on July 26, 1999 stated that ``[b]ecause of productivity gains, the economy can now operate at a higher speed without inflation....... [P]romoting the New Economy also requires wise policy from Washington. We need to support basic research and education at all levels, the seed corn of innovation.'' 
   These arguments are supported by noted MIT economist Lester Thurow in a June, 1999 Atlantic Monthly article, where he comments that: ``[a] successful knowledge based economy requires large public investments in education, infrastructure, and research and development....... Private rates of return on R&D spending (the financial benefits that accrue to the firm doing the spending) average about 24 percent. But societal rates of return on R&D spending (the economic benefits that accrue to the entire society) are about 66 percent....... This result, never contradicted in the economic literature, provides powerful evidence that there are huge positive social spillovers from research and development ..... Because the government doesn't care exactly which Americans reap the benefits, it has a very important role to play in R&D. Rates of return on R&D spending are far above those found elsewhere in the economy. Government now pays for about 30 percent of total R&D, but with a 66 percent rate of return it should be spending much more.'' 
   In recognition of this need for greater public support of science and technology research, last year the Senate unanimously passed the Federal Research Investment Act (S. 296). This bill would double our investment in civilian science and technology over the next decade. The Administration also understands how critical publicly funded R&D is to the country's vitality. Its budget includes a strong and balanced program which will begin to recharge our sagging R&D portfolio. The administration's program is consistent with the spirit and the text of the Federal Research Investment Act and the Council on Competitiveness letter. 
   Unfortunately, our Congressional Budget Resolution calls only for a small increase in federal investments in science and technology. We have a chance to make an important investment in our country's future and to lay the groundwork for continued American high-tech leadership. I urge my colleagues to heed our high-tech, academic, and labor leaders' call to action on federal R&D support and work together to achieve more substantial appropriations for science and technology.

   Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I am extremely pleased to be here today to introduce the Telemedicine Improvement and Modernization Act with Senator JEFFORDS and many other of my Senate colleagues. This bill incorporates two issues that I care about passionately--health care and technology. 
   Telemedicine has the potential to bridge the gap that currently exists between patients and providers. More than 25% of our Nation's senior citizens live in areas where speciality care may not be available. In states like my own where there are very few primary care or specialty care resources and travel is difficult, telemedicine is critical to ensuring that people in remote areas are getting health care they need. By expanding access to health care through telemedicine, we also improve the quality of care available to people living in underserved areas. Personally, I believe that we are just beginning to tap the enormous potential of technology to advance quality health care, especially in rural areas. 
   Yet, Medicare's telemedicine program is inefficient in its current form. These inefficiencies threaten the future of telemedicine services. When we first created this program, our knowledge of the potential of this new technology, or its practical applications was very limited. Today we have a much better understanding of how telemedicine actually works. With this new knowledge, we can repair the inefficiencies of the current system and encourage the use of this highly effective health practice. By accomplishing this goal, we can ensure that quality health care is available to all seniors and disabled Americans regardless of where they live. 
   There are 8 main elements of the bill:

    Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I am pleased and proud to introduce the MediKids Health Insurance Act of 2000. Congressman STARK is introducing a companion bill in the House. 
   This legislation is, without a doubt, ambitious. It is a deliberate effort to try to ignite a national commitment to the goal of insuring all of our children. For some, that is an idealistic proposition that does not seem achievable. With this bill, I want to call on the public and my colleagues to consider once again the clear and convincing case for investing the necessary resources in the health of our children--and therefore, in the well-being of their families and our entire country. I will continue to work hard on every possible step to achieve this ultimate goal, but with this legislation, I urge lawmakers, health care professionals, and citizens to recognize the imperative of reaching that goal sooner rather than later. 
   Our children are not only our future, they are also our present. What we do for them today will greatly affect what happens tomorrow. Yet even though we recognize these facts, we still have not found a way to guarantee health coverage for children. Without health insurance, many of these children go without health care all together. 
   Children are the least expensive segment of our population to insure. They are also the least able to have control over whether or not they have health insurance. Yet we now have over 11 million uninsured children in this country. And this number is steadily climbing higher and higher every year. 
   Our success in expanding Medicaid and passing the State Children's Health Insurance Program was a meaningful, significant start at closing the tragic gap represented by millions of uninsured children. However, Congress  cannot point to these programs and declare that our work is done. We still have much more to do. The percent of children in low-income families without health insurance has not changed in recent years. Even with perfect enrollment in S-CHIP and Medicaid, there would still be a great number of children without health insurance. 
   This is partially due to our increasingly mobile society, where parents frequently change jobs and families often move from state to state. When this occurs there is often a lapse in health coverage. Also, families working their way out of welfare fluctuate between eligibility and ineligibility for means-tested assistance programs. Another reason for the number of uninsured children is that the cost of health insurance continues to increase, leaving many working parents unable to afford coverage for themselves or their families. All of this adds up to the fact that many of our children do not have the consistent and regular access to health care which they need to grow up healthy. 
   That is why I am introducing the MediKids Health Insurance Act of 2000. This bill would automatically enroll every child at birth into a new, comprehensive federal safety net health 
   insurance program beginning in 2002. The benefits would be tailored to the needs of children and would be similar to those currently available to children under Medicaid. A small monthly premium would be collected from parents at tax filing, with discounts to low-income families phasing out at 300% of poverty. The children would remain enrolled in MediKids throughout childhood. When they are covered by another health insurance program, their parents would be exempt from the premium. The key to our program is that whenever other sources of health insurance fail, MediKids would stand ready to cover the health needs of our next generation. By the year 2020, every child in America would be able to grow up with consistent, continuous health insurance coverage. Like Medicare, MediKids would be independently financed, would cover benefits tailored to the needs of its target population, and would have the goal of achieving nearly 100% health insurance coverage for the children of this country--just as Medicare has done for our nation's seniors and disabled population. It's time we make this investment in the future of America by guaranteeing all children the health coverage they need to make a healthy start in life. The MediKids Health Insurance Act would offer guaranteed, automatic health coverage for every child with the simplest of enrollment procedures and no challenging outreach, paperwork, or re-determination hoops to jump through. It would be able to follow children across state lines, or tide them over in a new location until their parents can enroll them in a new insurance program. Between jobs or during family crises such as divorce or the death of a parent, it would offer extra security and ensure continuous health coverage to the nation's children. During that critical period when a family is just climbing out of poverty and out of the eligibility range for means-tested assistance programs, it would provide an extra boost with health insurance for the children until the parents can move into jobs that provide reliable health insurance coverage. And every child would automatically be enrolled upon birth, along with the issuance of the birth certificate or immigration card. 
   As we all know, an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. Providing health care coverage to children affects much more than their health--it affects their ability to learn, their ability to thrive, and their ability to become a productive member of society. I look forward to working with my colleagues and supporting organizations for the passage of the MediKids Health Insurance Act of 2000 to guarantee every child in America the health coverage they need to grow up healthy. 
   Mr. President, I stand before you today to deliver a message. That is that it is time to rekindle the discussion about how we are going to provide health insurance for all Americans. The bill I am introducing today--the MediKids Health Insurance Act of 2000--is a step toward eliminating the irrational and tragic lack of health insurance for so many children and adults in our country. 
   Partial solutions to America's ``uninsured crisis'' lie before Congress, and I recognize the sense of realism and care that are the basis for proposing incremental steps towards universal coverage. As someone involved in the tough battles in years past to achieve universal coverage, I will continue to do all I can to make whatever progress can be made each and every year. 
   But I also believe it is important to not lose sight of the ideal--and our capacity to reach that ideal--of the United States of America joining every other industrialized nation by ensuring that its citizens have basic health insurance. Until we succeed, millions of children and adults will suffer human and financial costs that are preventable. 
   Therefore, Mr. President, I offer this legislation to both enlist my colleagues in an effort to insist that all of our nation's children are insured as quickly as possible and to lay out the steps that would achieve that goal. At a time when Congress seems stalled by politics and paralysis, and is therefore failing to make any tangible progress in dealing with rising number of uninsured Americans, I hope this bill will help to build the will and momentum so desperately needed by our children for action that will change their lives and strengthen our very nation. I ask my colleagues from both sides of the aisle to join as co-sponsors.

   Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, this past Sunday, April 30, was the 25th anniversary of the end of the Vietnam war. And that reaches deep into the soul of every Member of this body, all across America, and all across the world. 
   Our involvement with Vietnam was filled with discord, it was filled with anxiety, and it tore sections and generations of our country apart. It began slowly. It gradually escalated and became ``a bottomless quagmire'' for America, ``our longest, costliest, and ..... least popular war,'' until it finally came to an end. 
   Many in our country were very ambivalent about this war. Some thought we didn't fight hard enough, some thought we turned our backs on the South Vietnamese, and some thought we should have fought a lot harder. 
   Many became disillusioned with our Government. I think that experience changed the nature of American politics and public life for at least some time to come. 
   However, there should be no ambivalence whatsoever about those who fought that war. Today I want to pay homage to those who fought that war. It doesn't matter whether you were for or against the war. All who served there deserve our appreciation, our respect, our caring, our compassion. It would have been easier to fight in a popular war. There are such wars, oddly enough. It is obtuse to say that, but it is true. 
   But it took guts, courage, and endurance to fight in that war and survive it; to resist the erosion of the bad morale which overtook at least part of our ground forces in Vietnam. And then, of course, there was the lack of united support from the home front which had to have just overwhelming consequences, not only while the soldiers were there, but even more so when they returned. 
   Those who served did their duty, and they did it under very difficult, trying circumstances. Their motto might very well have been what Alexander Pope said:  
   Act well your part, therein all honor lies.  
   Looking back at this war, like the war before it and others, what strikes me with enormous poignancy and tenderness, is how young our soldiers were. Many were teenagers--18- and 19-year-old men and women--from familiar and comfortable surroundings, leading lives we all might identify with, sent to a completely foreign country, a foreign culture, halfway around the world, not knowing what to expect. They encountered baking heat, torrential rain, fire ants, leeches, and the enemy. They could not imagine the world of horror that awaited them when they got there. Presumably they were trained and told about it, but I think it was unimaginable to them when they got there. There was no clear enemy line. They could be ambushed at any minute. They couldn't tell enemies from allies. 
   Some never came back. The more than 58,000 names on the Vietnam Memorial Wall attest to that. But painful as it is to view those names, it does not begin to encompass the scope of pain caused by that war. Like a pebble thrown in a pool, each single name on the wall is ringed by concentric circles of others touched by that person's death--widows, mothers, fathers, sisters, brothers, aunts, uncles, friends. For all in that pool, certain hopes and dreams died as well. We grieve for all of them. 
   Some came back wounded. In an instant, life could change. Soldiers could step on a landmine; they could be killed by friendly fire; they could come under random attack. They never knew from moment to moment. Due to the wonders of modern medicine, many of those who, in earlier wars, would have died, did not and were saved; they survived. But merely surviving posed tremendous burdens on those who did. The process of adapting, accepting, and moving on is easy to say, very hard to do. 
   So I salute the stubborn resilience and perseverance of those who did move on with life after recovering from injury. 
   Some came back suffering from emotional trauma--people call it PTSD--and many other things. For them, it has been a very hard road to make peace with the past. They are still haunted by it, fighting it in their nightmares, in startle reflexes to sudden noises which bring back memories of perceived danger. They may turn to  alcohol to numb the constant pain, to drown the memories. 
   Veterans suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder deserve our most profound compassion, love and caring. As we have discovered, PTSD in fact goes back even to World War I. We are discovering a lot of things about the consequences of war. We have no way of knowing what people have been through, those of us who were not there. But we cannot judge their continuing pain. We cannot judge them. But we can honor them, and we need to do that, to respect them for what they have done, and to hope they will recover as others did. 
   As a Senator from West Virginia, I have more than a personal interest in this war. Statistics show that West Virginia's soldiers suffered more casualties per capita during that war than any other State in the Union. On this day, I salute our West Virginia veterans in particular. I am enormously proud of the sons and daughters of West Virginia, who, as they have done throughout history, volunteered or were drafted, and went to fight and to protect their country and their freedom, mountain men doing what needed to be done. 
   That fighting spirit and strength of character runs incredibly deep in this Senator's State, and this Senator is very proud of it. 
   Lyndon Johnson called the war ``dirty, brutal and difficult.'' It tore apart our country, devastated lives, caused tremendous personal hardship and unbearable pain. Twenty years later, the scars are still healing. 
   I am reminded of the words of Maya Lin, the young architect student who designed the Vietnam Memorial. In conceptualizing the form of her design, she wrote:  
   I thought about what death is, what a loss is. A sharp pain that lessens with time, but never quite heals over. The idea occurred to me there on the site. Take a knife and cut open the earth, and with time, the grass would heal it.  
   With time, the wounds of Vietnam will heal. But we should never forget the courage and bravery of those who served there. Let us always honor our men and women who fought and died in Vietnam.

   Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I introduce, on behalf of myself and Senator MURRAY, legislation that would aid the children born with birth defects to female Vietnam veterans. This legislation, the Children of Female Vietnam Veterans' Benefits Act of 2000, is long overdue. As we commemorate the 25th anniversary of the end of the war, it is a particularly appropriate time for passage of this important legislation. 
   Women played a critical role in Vietnam. As nurses, they provided lifesaving care to the wounded and comfort to the dying. Their compassion and selflessness is legendary. Others served in countless other ways, as clerks, mapmakers, photographers, air traffic controllers, Red Cross and USO workers, and other volunteer roles. Their support was crucial to the war effort. 
   Last year, the VA completed study on women Vietnam veterans which concluded that there was a ``statistically significant increase in birth defects'' in their children. VA generally does not have the legal authority to provide health care and compensation to the children of veterans, except in the case of spina bifida. 
   The legislation we are sponsoring would apply to children of women Vietnam veterans born with birth defects, other than spina bifida, which resulted in permanent physical or mental disability, except for certain birth defects determined by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to result from genetics, birth injury, or fetal or neonatal infirmities with well-established causes. The benefits would include health care, vocational rehabilitation services, and financial compensation, depending on the degree of disability. 
   In closing, I emphasize that the health care and benefits provided by the Department of Veterans Affairs play a crucial role in supporting the healing process I spoke of earlier. While no amount of remuneration can ever truly compensate for bodily injury and emotional trauma, we have the responsibility to provide the tools for coping and to ease the difficulties of daily life. I urge my colleagues to support this measure. 
   This bill will provide health care and compensation to the children of women Vietnam veterans who were born with permanently disabling birth defects. Though they have waited 25 years for this acknowledgment, this legislation has the ability to significantly improve the lives of women veterans and their disabled children. These women and children have endured incredible and ongoing hardships for this country, and their significance must be realized. We can no longer ignore the responsibility the government owes to women veterans. 
   This bill has its origin in a study the Department of Veterans Affairs did on women Vietnam veterans. In response to the concerns of many women Vietnam Veterans, Congress required that VA perform a comprehensive study of any long-term adverse health effects that may have been suffered by these women. This mandate led to three separate but related epidemiologic studies of women Vietnam-era veterans: 1) a post Vietnam service mortality follow-up; 2) an assessment of psychologic health outcomes; and 3) a review of reproductive health outcomes. This particular study, released in 1999, analyzed the reproductive outcomes of over 4000 women Vietnam veterans, compared with 4000 women Vietnam-era veterans. 
   The study revealed that the risk of a woman Vietnam veterans having a child with birth defects was significantly elevated, even after adjusting for age, demographic variables, military characteristics, and smoking and alcohol consumption of the mothers. Upon review of the resulting conclusions, the VA study's task force recommended that the Secretary seek statutory authority to provide health care and other benefits to the offspring of women veterans with birth defects. Secretary West approved of this recommendation. The tragic realization of the birth defects present in so many of the children of women Vietnam veterans brings light to a situation that cries out not only for our sympathy, but for an acceptance of governmental responsibility and action. 
   VA does not have the authority under current law to provide health care or other benefits to the children of women Vietnam veterans disabled from birth defects other than spina bifida. Thus, the enabling legislation that I introduce today is absolutely necessary in order to address the compelling needs of these children. 
   Currently, VA has the authority to compensate and aid veterans, and the dependents of these veterans, for disease or injury to the veteran due to service. Millions of veterans, from every branch of the Armed Forces, have been helped by this benefit. These small amounts of compensation can in no way fully redress the physical and psychological injuries that war has caused these veterans, their children, and their spouses. But it does serve to assist these veterans to live active and fulfilled lives, and it would assist with making up for lost income over the years, due to the injuries. However, no benefits have been extended to the children of veterans, for their own harm. 
   In 1996, VA was given special authority to provide benefits and compensation to the children of Vietnam veterans for their own disease associated with their parent's service--for those children born with spina bifida. The legislation I am introducing today is modeled after that ground breaking spina bifida legislation. We owe that same debt to the children born with birth defects to women Vietnam veterans. My cosponsors and I believe that providing this assistance to children disabled by birth defects associated with their mother's military service would be a fitting extension of the principle of providing benefits for disabilities that are incurred or aggravated as a result of service on active duty in the Armed Forces of the United States. 
   I am seeking to aid the children of women Vietnam veterans who have been tragically affected by birth defects. These women fought for their country, and served this Nation with honor and courage. They volunteered to be placed in harm's way, without knowledge of what effects their service may bring later. Many were nurses who cared for wounded soldiers, and offered enormously important support services to all those in active duty. Indeed, these women provided such an incredible nursing service to injured soldiers that less than 2% of all treated casualties during the war died. These women saw death and disease, and they experienced their own forms of disillusionment with the war. These women  fought on the front lines; they were not kept away in safe places during the conflict. 
   Further, I want to add that these women performed a service for women who have been in any way involved in the Armed Forces since then, by contributing to the changes in the military structure of the 1970s and since. Women performed critically important roles during the Vietnam war. Their ongoing contributions were recognized as altogether essential. Disastrously, some of their children have suffered because their mothers were so courageous, and it is time for them to begin to be repaid for that suffering. 
   Though long overdue perhaps, now is a particularly appropriate time for passage of this important legislation. As we celebrate the 25th anniversary of the end of the Vietnam War, we 
   must remember the women Vietnam veterans who served this country so well, all those years ago. These women paid for their service not only with their own bodies, but too often with the bodies of their children who were born years later. It is my opinion that this legislation is late in coming, but there is no time like the present. As we take these recent months to remember the Vietnam War, I can think of no more fitting time than this for this bill. After all, though the fighting in Vietnam came to an end 25 years ago, the consequences of that fighting are still dramatically present. 
   At the heart of this legislation, this bill would apply to children of women Vietnam veterans born with birth defects, other than spina bifida, which resulted in permanent physical or mental disability, except for birth defects determined by the Secretary of Veterans' Affairs to result from familial disorders, birth-related injuries, or fetal or neonatal infirmities with well-established causes. 
   The legislation authorizes VA to provide or reimburse a contractor for health care delivered to the disabled children for the birth defect and associated conditions. This health care would include home, hospital, nursing home, outpatient, preventative, habilitative, rehabilitative and respite care. It also includes pharmaceuticals and supplies required by the birth defect, such as wheelchairs, if appropriate. 
   The legislation also provides compensation from the VA to the children at four payment levels. The benefits would be for $100, $214, $743, and $1,272, per month, depending upon the severity of the child's disability. Future cost-of-living adjustments would be based on the Consumer Price Index, just as other veterans and Social Security benefits are adjusted. 
   This bill also authorizes VA to furnish the disabled children with important vocational rehabilitation services. The services would include: VA design of a training plan that is individually designed, accounting for the individual needs of the child; placement and post-placement services, personal and work adjustment training. It may also include education at an institution of higher learning. The programs would generally run 24 months, but if necessary, the Secretary may extend the program for an additional 24 months. 
   This legislation would be effective one year after the date of enactment, in order to allow time for regulations to be established. VA estimates that the costs for this legislation would be approximately $25 million over five years. 
   In conclusion, I believe that we must help the children born with disabling birth defects associated with their mother's service in Vietnam. It is the logical extension of our policy to provide benefits for disabilities that result from service. It's the compassionate thing to do--to ensure that these children have the health care and other benefits they need to survive. As a nation, it is our unwavering responsibility to deal with all the consequences of war, not just the easy and obvious ones.

   Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, today I am here to talk about our Nation's most vulnerable children--those innocent kids who are in the child protection system because they have been abused or neglected by parents, many of whom have drug or alcohol problems. Over 500,000 children are in foster care nationwide and 3,000 children are in West Virginia. Each one deserves a safe, permanent home according to the fundamental guidelines set by the 1997 Adoption and Safe Families Act. 
   National statistics range between 40 percent and 80 percent of families in the child welfare system struggling with alcohol or drug abuse, or both. One recent survey noted that 67 percent of the parents involved in child abuse or neglect cases needed alcohol or drug treatment, but only one-third of those parents got the appropriate treatment or services to deal with their addiction. In my own state of West Virginia, over half of the children placed in foster care have families with alcohol or drug abuse problems, and we know even more children are at risk of neglect, but are not in foster care yet because of their parent's substance abuse problems. 
   Another sad, stunning statistic is that children with open child welfare cases whose parents have substance abuse problems are younger than other children in foster care, and they are more likely to be the victims of severe and chronic neglect. Once such children are placed in foster care, they tend to stay in care longer than other children. 
   I believe the only way to achieve the critical goals of a safe, healthy, and permanent home for every child is to tackle the problem of alcohol and drug abuse among parents. What happens to parents who abuse alcohol or drugs ultimately will decide that child's fate. To help the child, we must address the addiction of their parents. 
   The issue of alcohol and drug abuse is difficult. Part of the 1997 Adoption and Safe Families Act required the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to study this problem within the child welfare system. This important report, Blending Perspectives and Building Common Ground, outlines our challenges. There is a lack of appropriate treatment and services, especially services designed to meet the needs of parents in the child protection system. Unfortunately, there is poor communication and collaboration between alcohol and drug abuse agencies and child protection agencies. Issues such as confidentiality, different definitions of who ``the client'' is, and different time frames for decisions make collaboration harder. For example, under the 1997 Adoption and Safe Families Act, state agencies and courts are expected to consider termination of parental rights if a child has been in foster care for 15 of 22 months. Treatment programs designed for single clients have different time frames. 
   To address the challenge, we must find new ways to encourage these two independent systems to work together on behalf of parents with an alcohol or drug problem and their children. 
   In addition to treating the patient's addiction, we must also provide for the needs of their child. 
   Therefore, we need to create incentives for both agencies to consider the total picture--What are the child's needs? What are the parent's needs? How can we effectively serve both, and meet the fundamental goals of the Adoption Law that every child deserves a safe, healthy, permanent home. 
   The HHS report sets five priorities. First, it calls for building collaborative working relationships among agencies. It stresses that addiction is a treatable disease, but access to timely, comprehensive substance abuse treatment services is key. Keeping clients in treatment is crucial, but serving parents is harder because services must also be available to their children. As mentioned, children of abusing parents need special services. The final priority  in the HHS study is for research and more information on the interaction between substance abuse and child maltreatment. 
   Today, I am proud to join with my colleagues, Senator SNOWE, DEWINE, and DODD to introduce legislation to address this troubling issue. We have worked for months with state officials, child advocates and officials in the substance abuse community to develop the Child Protection/Alcohol and Drug Partnership Act of 2000. This bill builds on the foundation of the Adoption and Safe Families Act of 1997--fundamental goals of making a child's safety, health, and permanency paramount. 
   To accomplish these bold goals, we need to be bold by investing in partnerships that will respond to the needs and priorities outlined in the comprehensive HHS study. I believe a new program and a new approach are essential. A new system is needed to address the special concerns of this unique population--parents with alcohol and drug problems who neglect their children. A program designed to serve a single male with drug problems doesn't respond to the needs of a mother and her child. 
   To be effective, we must link child protection workers with those involved in alcohol and drug treatment programs. Forging new partnerships takes time--and it takes money. That is why our legislation invests $1.9 billion over 5 years to combat the problems of drugs and alcohol abuse in families in the child welfare system. 
   I understand this is a large sum, but alcohol and drug abuse is a huge problem. Before reacting to the cost of the bill, consider what the costs are if we do nothing. 
   If we do not invest in alcohol and drug abuse prevention and treatment for such families, children will be neglected or abused. Young children will be placed in foster care, at a wide range of costs, and they will linger there longer than other children without family substance abuse problems. 
   In 1997, the House Ways and Means Subcommittee received testimony from Professor 
   Richard Barth who noted that many newborns in substance abuse cases already had siblings placed in foster care. Barth estimated that if only one-third of the mothers with substance abuse problems got successful, early treatment upon the birth of their first child, instead of waiting until later, many years of foster care placements could be prevented and millions of dollars could be saved. 
   Our bill is designed to tackle this tough issue so agencies do not wait too long to help vulnerable children. Our bill will promote innovative approaches that serve both parents and children. It will offer funding for screening and assessment to enhance prevention. It will support outreach to families and retention so that parents stay in treatment. It can support joint training, and educate alcohol and drug counselors about the special needs of children and the importance of a safe, permanent home. It can support out-patient services or residential treatment. It allows investments in after-care to keep families and children safe. 
   If we do invest in such specialized alcohol and drug treatment programs for families, we can achieve two things. For many families, I hope, treatment will be successful and children will return to a safe and stable home. But for others, we will have tried, and learned the important lesson that some children need an alternate place--some children need adoption. Under the Adoption and Safe Families Act, courts cannot move forward on adoption until appropriate services have been provided to families. That is the law, and we must follow it. Therefore, to move some children towards adoption, services must be tried for their families. 
   We want a responsible approach that will include accountability. It requires annual reports to assess how much progress is made each and every year. Reports should measure success in treating parents, but equally important will be measures of children's safety and family stability. 
   Over the years, we have worked on child welfare issues in a positive, bipartisan manner. I am proud to continue the bipartisan approach as we grapple with such tough controversial issues as alcohol and drug abuse among parents in the child welfare system.

    Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I wish to take this opportunity to explain why I missed the vote on the motion to invoke cloture on S. 2285, the Federal Fuels Tax Holiday bill, and more importantly, to explain why I would have voted against cloture on this bill. 
   I had to be absent for this vote because I was traveling to Taiwan, where I became the first Member of the U.S. Congress to visit its newly elected leadership. I made the trip to discuss and reinforce Taiwan's close economic ties with my state of West Virginia, and to relay our country's interest in Taiwan and its continued stable relations with China. 
   Had I been in Washington, DC, for this vote, I would have most assuredly voted against it. I would have opposed cloture for a number of reasons, including my philosophical opposition to the frequent use of the cloture procedure by the majority to foreclose Democratic initiatives. However, I was happy to see that this cloture motion failed because of more substantive concerns. Quite simply, this bill represents bad tax policy, bad energy policy, and bad transportation policy, all dressed up in an election year wrapper. 
   Proponents of the gas tax ``holiday'' would have us believe that this bill--which would have cut more than $200 million in federal highway money for West Virginia--was offered to do something about the recent price increases for gasoline and other fuels. Petroleum products are taxed at the refinery, not at the pump, and consumers would not have seen any of the savings passed through to them. Consumers in some states would even have seen their state gasoline tax go up in response to the federal tax going down. The effect of this bill would have been the creation of a windfall for oil companies and middlemen, with West Virginians still paying much more than the national average for a gallon of gas. 
   Mr. President, I would like to briefly discuss some of the problems with this legislation. The proposed 4.3 cent reduction would translate to more than $4 billion in lost revenue that would otherwise go to the Highway Trust Fund. The complete elimination of fuel taxes that would have been triggered by the price of gas going above $2.00 would explode that shortfall to more than $20 billion--all to be made up from a surplus that some would argue does not exist. These funding reductions would have put hundreds of thousands of Americans out of work, jeopardized projects to upgrade our aging transportation infrastructure, and put millions of highway users at risk. 
   In addition to the severe cutback in the highway funding mechanism, which we were so happy to put in place two years ago with the passage of TEA-21, the impact of the fuel tax repeal would have left the Airport and Airway Trust Fund under-funded to the tune of about $700 million a year. The effect on airline passenger safety, and on airport construction and maintenance projects, would be devastating. 
   Repeal of the gasoline excise tax would have eliminated the tax incentives we in Congress have instituted to expand the use of alternative fuels. Without the general excise tax from which to partially exempt alternative or blended fuels, there would be no realistic means of bringing our nation into compliance with fuel diversity standards we have previously worked to put in place. As this temporary worldwide shortage of gasoline demonstrates so painfully at the pumps, the United States needs an energy policy that weakens the grip of foreign suppliers. 
   Finally, Mr. President, I would like to comment on an earlier cloture vote on this issue. On March 30 I voted for the cloture motion on the motion to proceed to this bill. I voted this way not because I supported the gas tax repeal, but precisely because I thought the Senate should proceed to consideration of the bill, so that its many faults could be debated, and the bill could be voted down.

   Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I will not suggest that people vote against the amendment of the Senator from New Hampshire, but it is interesting to me that in his original amendment, he said that Congress ``should'' pass a Medicare prescription drug benefit. He changed it to the budget resolution ``assumes that among its reform options, Congress should explore a Medicare prescription drug.'' That is a very different content statement regarding the seriousness about prescription drugs. I do not, however, oppose his amendment.

   Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of Senator ROBB's amendment to insist that tax cuts do not take priority over ensuring that tens of millions of seniors receive affordable outpatient prescription drug coverage. 
   This is a commonsense amendment about priorities. If we have hundreds of billions of dollars in the next several years to spend on tax reductions that will primarily benefit the wealthiest Americans--and that's what my Republican colleagues are saying when they voted for $250 billion over 5 years in tax cuts for some married people just last week--then we should certainly enact a meaningful Medicare out-patient drug benefit first. It's important to note that when it comes to tax cuts for married people, the Republican proposal doesn't even focus on eliminating the marriage penalty, but rather, gives large bonuses to only certain upper-income married couples. The cost of the Senate Finance marriage bonus proposal explodes in the out years. And yet, when it comes to finding a way to offer Medicare beneficiaries a prescription drug benefit there are all kinds of ifs and conditions. 
   Senator ROBB is right to say let's do first things first. I urge my colleagues to vote for his amendment that makes a statement about our order of priority. I know too many West Virginia seniors who too frequently go without food, or heat, or other necessities because they are forced to make the terrible choice between the drugs they need and other necessities of life. This is just plain wrong. We should provide all Medicare beneficiaries with a health care benefit that meets their needs. It is ludicrous that the Medicare program doesn't currently offer this critical component of health care today. We should change that, and we have the resources to do it this year. We have the resources if we don't fritter them away by picking favored constituencies for special tax breaks. 
   Let's look at the facts about how the Republican budget treats tax cuts and how it treats the real hope of many Americans that we will find a way to provide a Medicare outpatient prescription drug benefit. The Republican budget's statement of purpose is to provide $150 billion in tax cuts over 5 years. It provides the money to the Senate Finance Committee to do it. It is a certainty. It will have the protection of reconciliation. 
   The Republican budget resolution on Medicare prescription drugs does nothing more than suspend existing budget rules to allow for a Medicare drug benefit should the Senate meet its moral responsibility to provide one. It doesn't say do it. It says you can do it. It includes only a $20 billion placeholder to finance a drug benefit. Most people agree that won't be sufficient to offer a decent drug benefit to all Medicare beneficiaries. Moreover, the Republican budget resolution puts a 3-year time limit on a possible Medicare drug benefit--with absolutely no guarantee that the benefit would be continued after 2005. The Republican budget resolution also conditions 2004 and 2005 funding of a possible Medicare drug benefit on Medicare reform. Congress clearly has not reached any consensus on how to approach Medicare reform. 
   Mr. President, we have a unique window of opportunity to do something good for millions of seniors and disabled Americans. I strongly urge my colleagues to do what is right and vote for the Robb amendment to provide prescription drug coverage to Medicare.

    Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Rural Telecommunications Modernization Act. This Act would create a tax credit for companies that invest in providing broadband telecommunications services available in rural areas. The convergence of computing and communications has changed the way America interacts and does business. Individuals, businesses, schools, libraries, hospitals, and many others, reap the benefits of networked communications more and more each year. However, where in the past access to low bandwidth telephone facilities met our communications needs, today many people and organizations need the ability to transmit and receive large amounts of data quickly--as part of electronic commerce, distance learning, telemedicine, and even for mere access to many web sites. 
   In some areas of the country companies are building networks that meet this broadband need as fast as they can. Technology companies are fighting to roll out broadband facilities as quickly as they can in urban and suburban areas. They are tearing up streets to instal fiber optics, converting cable TV facilities to broadband telecom applications, developing incredible new DSL technologies that convert regular copper telephone wires into broadband powerhouses. 
   Other areas are not as fortunate. In rural areas access to broadband communications is harder to come by. In fact, there are only a few broadband providers outside big cities and suburban areas nationwide. This is because in many cases rural areas are more expensive to serve. Terrain is difficult. Populations are widely dispersed. Importantly, many of our broadband technologies cannot serve people who live more than eighteen thousand feet from a phone company's central office--which is the case for most rural Americans. 
   The implications for the country if we allow this broadband disparity to continue are alarming. Organizations in traditional robust communications and computing regions, often located in prosperous urban and suburban communities, will be able to reap the rewards of the so-called ``New Economy.'' Organizations in other areas, often in rural areas, including many areas in my State of West Virginia, will suffer the consequences of being unable to take advantage of the astounding power of broadband networked computing. 
   Just as companies that employ technological advances are decimating their less technologically savvy competitors, businesses in infrastructure-rich areas may soon decimate competitors in infrastructure-poor areas. This is just as true for rural students and workers trying to gain new skills who are competing against their non-rural peers in the New Economy. The result of this digital divide could be disastrous for rural Americans: job loss, tax revenue loss, brain drain, and business failure concentrated in rural areas. 
   Denying rural Americans a chance to participate in the New Economy is also bad for the national economy. Businesses will be forced to locate their operations and hire their employees in urban locations that have adequate broadband infrastructure, rather than in rural locations that are otherwise more efficient due to the location of  their customers or suppliers, a stable or better workforce, and cheaper production environments. Additionally, without adequate infrastructure, the businesses and individuals in these communications infrastructure poor areas are less likely to be integrated into the national electronic marketplace. Their absence would put a damper on the growth of the digital economy for everyone--not just for those in rural areas. 
   Therefore, we must do everything we can to ensure that broadband communications are available to all areas of the country--rural as well as urban. The Rural Telecommunications Modernization Act addresses this problem. 
   The Rural Telecommunications Modernization Act would give companies the incentive to build broadband facilities in rural areas by using a very focused tax credit. It would offer any company that invests in broadband facilities in rural areas a tax credit over the next three years. This tax credit will help fight the growing disparity in technology I just described. 
   The credit is only available for certain investments. First, investments must be for ``broadband local access facilities.'' Second, investments must support ``high-speed broadband telecommunications services.'' And third, investments must serve only ``rural counties.'' 
   The Rural Telecommunications Modernization Act is part of the solution to the critically important digital divide problem. Rural Americans deserve the chance to participate in the New Economy. Without access to broadband services they will not have this chance. I hope that the Members of this body will support this important bill.

    Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I am proud to introduce today the ``Recognition of Physician Assistants in the Department of Veterans Affairs Act of 2000,'' which I am delighted to cosponsor with Senators JEFFORDS and HUTCHISON. The bill before us would establish within the Veterans Health Administration an advisory position on physician assistants--an action long overdue. 
   It is baffling to me that the VA--the largest single employer of physician assistants in the country--does not provide direct representation for physician assistants. VA has nearly 1,200 physician assistants working in hospitals and clinics, yet VA is the only federal health care agency that does not have a physician assistant in a leadership role. Skimming through the VA phone directory, we find much needed representation for social workers, dentists, audiologists and speech pathologists, nutritionists, recreational therapists, and nurses. Physician assistants, however, are hidden within the bailiwick of the Chief Consultant for Primary and Ambulatory Care. 
   This lack of physician assistant leadership has translated into a lack of knowledge about the profession at the national level--which, in turn, has filtered down to the local level. For example, the scope of practice for physician assistants is not uniformly understood in all VA medical facilities and clinics. Practitioners in the field also report confusion regarding such issues as privileging, supervision, and physician countersignature. Some facilities unnecessarily restrict the ability of physician assistants to provide medical care, while others will not hire physician assistants. The unfortunate consequence of these restrictions is to limit veterans' access to quality medical care. 
   In June 1997, the final report of a work group to explore internal practice barriers for Advanced Practice Nurses,  Clinical Pharmacy Specialists, and Physician Assistants was issued. To date, we have seen no response regarding what VA plans to do to implement the recommendations contained in the report. 
   Although the work group's report does not contain a specific recommendation for an advisory position, the report clearly states that ``many times unnecessary, inappropriate restrictions have been placed on their [PAs] practice.'' An advisor would be especially helpful in clarifying all issues associated with the profession, including education, qualifications, clinical privileges, and scope of practice. I firmly believe that such an advisor is the key to removing barriers to greater use of these valued health care professionals. I also encourage VA to move ahead with the other recommendations contained in the work group report. 
   I personally understand the huge importance of physician assistants. My own state of West Virginia is highly dependent upon their expertise. We count on them to provide quality health care in a cost-effective way. 
   In closing, I thank the Veterans Affairs Physician Assistants Association, which has always provided me with the most up-to-date information about the state of the physician assistant profession. I hope the Committee on Veterans' Affairs will work expeditiously to pass this bill out of committee. Physician assistants--and their patients--are depending upon it.

   Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, the words of my friend from the State of Washington are not justified except if they are returned to him and to his staff. 
   The process of working legislation is extraordinary. This has been a very long process, more or less a 2-year process. Working with Senator Slade Gorton from the State of Washington over the years has been a great privilege for me and continues on this bill, which is the Wendell H. Ford Aviation Investment and Reform Act for the 21st Century, which is a long title, but we had to give it a long title in order to be able to give it an acronym, which is FAIR-21. FAIR, that is what the bill is.  Wendell Ford, should he be listening, should be very proud. 
   We have had half a dozen temporary extensions on this bill. It has been 2 years in the making. When Senator GORTON talks about the enormous number of hours spent by Sam Whitehorn of the committee staff, Kerry Ates of my own staff, and members of his own committee and personal staff, he is exactly right. It has been an extraordinary and frustrating process but a successful one. 
   There are many Members of the Senate and the House to thank. It was one of those situations where you had the authorizing committees, the budget committees, the appropriations committees, in both Houses, coming to an agreement--which is very rare in something of this sort, and all in a fairly short period of time. Frankly, including obviously Senator GORTON, I think I really want to thank the majority leader, Senator TRENT LOTT, for stepping in in a most remarkable way, most forcefully, at a critical time, to bring the parties together and make sure we pushed toward a solution. 
   In the end, I think we have achieved a bipartisan House-Senate compromise of which I, for one at least, am very proud. We have a final bill that will set us on an entirely new path in terms of the FAA, and in a larger sense for aviation in this country, which has enormous impact. For the aviation community, and those of us who work with them--and I thank them for their help on this bill, also; not all of them being happy about all aspects of it, but that is in the nature of things--hopefully this good economic news, of the passage of this bill, is, however, entirely overshadowed by fear that most of us have about the state of our system as it is now, of our aviation system particularly in regard to air traffic control and other matters in our infrastructure. 
   At current levels, our system is already so overburdened we are suffocating from congestion and delays. The country suffers through it. Is there a popular uprising? There does not seem to be one. But the fact is, it is a suffocating situation, a dangerous situation. We are increasingly concerned about safety, with every single reason to be, given the doubling of the number of air passengers and many more cargo planes and passenger planes to be built in the future. Whatever you see today, try to double it in your mind and then figure the same number of runways. How on Earth are people going to accept a situation where delays are growing longer and it becomes more dangerous unless we do something about it? This bill does. Delays have increased by 50 percent. Today, one in four flights is delayed more than 15 minutes. That is not what passengers want. That is not what airlines want. 
   To be very blunt about it, if there is no change in the way 
   we are doing business, we will come to a situation before the year 2015 where there will be, somewhere in this world, a major airplane crash every 7 to 10 days. That is the course. It is a terrible course, a dangerous course, and one which this Congress cannot allow to go on and which this Congress, in fact, with this bill, does a great deal about. 
   We have fallen behind. Unless we get started immediately in the effort to modernize our air traffic control system, to fix our airports, we stand a very good chance of never being able to catch up, never catching up to the curve, much less getting ahead of it. That is fundamentally what this bill, FAIR-21, is about. 
   It is about fixing the system. It is about trying to get ahead of the growth curve with our most significant increase ever in airport and air traffic control funding, and some fundamental reforms in the way we do business in our system. It is about improving safety and service for the traveling public and supporting aviation employees under great stress in their challenging jobs. Senator GORTON and I have each seen that on many occasions. These people work under incredible tension all the time. They work with very old equipment. 
   It is about increasing competition. It is about giving a leg up, finally, to small communities such as I have in my State, as does Senator GORTON, as does every Senator in his or her State--small communities that were left behind when we did airline deregulation 20 years ago. 
   So, FAIR-21, this bill, will provide $40 billion for the FAA in fiscal year 2001 until fiscal year 2003. It is a 25-percent increase in total aviation funding. The key investments will be fixing aviation infrastructure, to wit, airport funding will increase by 33 percent, and air traffic control modernization funding will increase by 40 percent. That is so desperately needed. FAA funding operations will also increase by approximately 15 percent over the same period. We are beginning to nudge into the area to start fixing our problems. 
   This bill represents the will of the Congress, hopefully, and the will of the American people, to take a dangerous situation and start to fix it. For the very first time, FAIR-21 establishes that all revenues and interest paid into the aviation trust fund by airline passengers, lo and behold, will be spent on aviation. That seems quite fair to me. That means that $33 billion of the $40 billion will be guaranteed from the trust fund, not taken off-budget, which this Senator would have liked to have seen but was not going to happen; so not taken off-budget but protected through points of order and with a strong commitment from the Appropriations Committee to fully fund all accounts. This was part of the magic of the process that Senator TRENT LOTT, Senator GORTON, and others worked out to make people satisfied. 
   All told, this represents--and my colleagues should hear this--the biggest total increase in aviation investments ever. I know few problems receive that kind of boost unless the Congress perceives there is a crisis. What we learned over recent years about aviation was that a crisis was coming. I am thankful we have the foresight to take action now. 
   To move beyond the funding issue for a moment, I want to point out a few of the key aviation law and policy changes contained in this bill which I think are very helpful and good: 
   Whistle-blower protection for aviation and airline employees who report safety problems; 
   A $1.50 increase on the cap of the passenger facility charge for airport projects, which is enormously helpful to local airports; 
   An Air Service Development Program, with grants up to $500,000 each for innovative efforts to improve air service in small communities; in other words, small communities can do something and get a match; 
   A ban on smoking everywhere, even internationally; 
   Easing of the slots rule at O'Hare, LaGuardia, and Kennedy Airports. This carries with it some controversy. Compromises were made. Not everybody was happy. But resolution was reached; 
   New criminal background checks and training for airport security personnel as the pressure on all of that continues to increase; 
   Increased funding for the essential air service program is enormously important in my State of West Virginia and every single area where there are rural airports. The State of the Presiding Officer has its fair share of those; 
   Finally, new and increased penalties for airline customer service violations. That goes along with the effort Senator GORTON and I led to have a passenger bill of rights, which the airlines could have first crack at, which seems to be working out very well but, on the other hand, we are watching very closely. 
   We have had a lot of time to work on this bill and, in my view, it has gotten better and better during the process and reached a crescendo in the last several days. It is a bold conference report designed to protect our future. I hope my colleagues will join me and the Senator from the State of Washington in sending this bill to the President. 
   So much of the work is done not just by Senators willing to compromise and House Members willing to compromise but, most importantly, by staff who worked through the night often to make sure things came out very well. 
   When we began the effort to enact meaningful legislation to address the needs of our air transportation system, we knew it would be a difficult process. Even anticipating that, I can tell you that it has been more difficult than any of us could have imagined. 
   This bill has been more than two years in the making, with nearly a half-dozen temporary extensions in the process. There are many Members in  the Senate and House to thank for all of the hard work and effort it took to bring this to a conclusion. Members on and off the conference committee have really rolled up their sleeves to work out a very difficult compromise. And above all others, the majority leader stepped in during these critical and delicate last few months to push us toward a final solution. 
   In the end, we've achieved a bipartisan, House-Senate compromise that I am very proud of. We have a final bill that I believe will set us on an entirely new path for the FAA and aviation. 
   Aviation in this country is at a crossroads. Aviation is a critical engine of economic development at the national and local levels, and it has the potential for unprecedented and incomprehensive growth over the next decade. 
   The travel and tourism industry employs 1 in 17 Americans. 
   Air travelers spend over $500 billion each year in the U.S. and generate more than $70 billion in federal, state and local taxes. 
   Aviation is the only U.S. industry that has consistently enjoyed a positive trade balance. 
   By 2009, enplanements are projected to increase to 1 billion people, from 650 million in 1999. 
   In many respects this is good news--it is one of the great success stories of our booming economy. Yet, for the aviation community and those of us who work with them, this good news is entirely overshadowed by fears about the state of our system. At current traffic levels, our system is already so overburdened that we are suffocating from congestion and delays, and we are increasingly concerned about safety. 
   Almost every week, another red flag goes up about the looming crisis in aviation. 
   Scheduled flying times have increased 75 percent on the top 200 routes in the nation. 
   Delays have increased by 50 percent, and today one in four flights is delayed more than 15 minutes, at a cost to the economy of more than $4 billion. 
   Recent data shows a rise in runway incidents (so-called runway incursions), and we read too often about near-misses in the skies. 
   If there is no change in the current accident rate before the year 2015, there is expected to be a major airline accident somewhere in the world every 7-10 days. 
   Yet, from 1998 to 1999, the FAA had to reduce safety inspections by 10 percent and cut 5 percent of its security staff. 
   All of us--the airlines, the airports, and the Congress--have had a difficult time keeping up with the pace of growth. The result is that, as a nation, we've fallen behind. Unless we get started immediately in the effort to modernize our traffic control system and fix our airports, we may never catch up. 
   That's fundamentally what this bill, FAIR-21, is all about. It's about fixing the system and trying to get ahead of the growth curve--with our most significant increase ever in airport and air traffic control funding and some fundamental reforms of our system. 
   And it's about improving safety and service for the traveling public; supporting aviation employees in challenging jobs, increasing competition, and giving a leg up finally to small communities who were left behind in airline deregulation twenty years ago. 
   FAIR-21 will provide $40 billion for the FAA for FY 2001-2003--a 25 percent increase in total aviation funding. The key investments will be fixing aviation 
   infrastructure--airport funding will increase by 33 percent and air traffic control modernization funding will increase by 40 percent. FAA operations funding also will increase, by approximately 15 percent over the same period. 
   For the first time, FAIR-21 establishes that all revenues and interest paid into the aviation trust fund by airline passengers will be spent on aviation. That means that $33 billion of the $40 billion bill will be guaranteed from the trust fund--not taken off-budget but protected through points of order and with a strong commitment from the Appropriations Committee to fully fund all accounts. The remaining $6.7 billion would come from the General Fund, subject to appropriations. 
   For fiscal year 2001, the bill fully meets the President's budget request for FAA operations and air traffic control equipment, and it exceeds the President's budget request for AIP by $1.2 billion. 
   All told this represents the biggest total increase in aviation investments ever. I know that few programs receive that kind of boost--unless a crisis exists. What we have learned about aviation is that a crisis is coming. And I'm thankful we have the foresight to take action now. 
   To move beyond the funding issue for a moment, let me also highlight a few of the key aviation law and policy changes contained in this bill that I think are particularly important. I am very pleased that the bill contains: whistleblower protection for airline and aviation employees who report safety problems; a $1.50 increase in the cap on the passenger facility charge for airport projects; an Air Service Development program, with grants of up to $500,000 each for innovative efforts to improve air service in small communities; a ban on smoking on all flights to and from the U.S., including international flights; an easing of the slot rules at O'Hare, LaGuardia and Kennedy Airports; a focus on reducing the number of runway incursions that can result in serious accidents; new criminal background checks and training for airport security personnel; increased funding for the Essential Air Service program; and new and increased penalties for airline's customer service violations. 
   We have had a lot of time to work on this bill, and in my view it has gotten better and better. It is a bold conference report designed to protect our future, and I hope my colleagues will join me in sending it on to the President for his signature. 
   Before we end the debate this morning, I want to say a few things. Again, all of the staff from the Commerce Committee, my office, the offices of the other conferees, and the House staff, deserve our thanks. They spent months working on this bill. In fact, this bill was started almost 2 years ago. Countless hours, late nights, lots of missed family events. We owe all of them our thanks. 
   I also want to thank, and I know Senator HOLLINGS and others share this, Hans Ephramson-Abt. Many of you probably have encountered him. He is a gentleman, first and foremost, who has worked for years to help the families of victims of aviation disasters. The conference report changes the liability laws for accidents offshore, preserving the ability of people like the children of Montoursville, PA, who vanished in the TWA flight 800 tragedy. Hans lost his daughter, Alice, on KAL 007, shot down off of Korea in September 1983. He has done a great service in helping others, and for that we all owe him a debt of gratitude. 
   Finally, I want to say that we have had a long debate over the last several years about FAA reform. For now, that issue has been resolved. Over the next several years, working with Administrator Garvey, or her successor, we will look at other ways to improve the FAA. Today, the bill before you does many creative things for the FAA--giving it the tools to be more business-like, but retaining its crucial role as safety arbiter. The bill, for example, gives the FAA the ability to enter into long-term leases for satellite communications services, something that will save the FAA money. It establishes a public-private funding mechanism to expedite the installation of air traffic control equipment, with the priorities set by the private sector. It structures the FAA after corporate models, establishing one person to be accountable for air traffic control operations and plans. It establishes a Board to oversee those activities. The FAA, because of actions led by the Commerce Committee and Senator LAUTENBERG, today has procurement and personnel flexibility that no other governmental agency has. We have achieved a lot over the last several years, and with this bill, continue to make progressive changes to the FAA, without compromising safety. I know that there are some in the Administration that are not satisfied, and probably will never be satisfied, but this is a good bill and one that will do a lot for our aviation system. I urge my colleagues to fully support this bill.

   Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I only make a couple of comments. I indicated this is the largest increase in aviation spending in history. I did that out of a sense of pride because of the urgency of the situation we face. This is not money which is being spent for the sake of money; it is money being spent so we will not walk into the disaster we are now headed towards. 
   I remind my colleagues--the delays, the near misses, the pressure, the outdated equipment, the insufficient time for preparation at work, salaries, money for various purposes--we cannot take an air traffic control system or modernize an FAA in the way they want to do it, we cannot pay the many thousands of people who work to keep it safe in this country, without spending money. 
   It has been said a number of times that the number of people who will be flying in this country will be a billion in less than 10 years. Cargo traffic on a worldwide basis, as well as in our country, will increase exponentially. The number of planes flying in the skies will increase by at least 50 percent in less than 10 years. Think about that. We have the same number of runways; we have 20- to 30-year-old computers trying to figure out what altitudes the planes are flying and figure out how to separate them; we look at all the different tracking systems we have in our aviation system and we would be embarrassed to have that equipment in our own Senate offices. It is a crisis. Therefore, it is a priority. We are talking about the saving of American lives and lives across the world. Money must be spent. 
   It is not that other transportation is any less important. This Senator benefits enormously from the services of Amtrak. An airplane crash does something to the Nation's psychology. It can take 2 or 3 years for an airline to recover from an instant which costs lives. The economic impact and, most importantly, the human impact and the pressure on people who run the  aviation system to prevent these things from happening, to have safe skies, is absolutely overwhelming. It is something which is not recognized sufficiently by the American people and which we are, happily, recognizing in this bill. 
   The Secretary of the Department of Transportation is happy with this bill and will recommend to the President that he sign it. Jane Garvey, the FAA Administrator--somebody in whom I have an enormous amount of confidence, who has run Boston's airport by herself and knows the situation cold--is very much in support of this. 
   After all, we have not taken anything off budget. The aviation trust fund is still on budget. We have not built any firewalls. We have acted in a responsible fashion. However, we have applied more money because this is a particularly special crisis which, thank heavens, after a number of years, Congress has finally recognized. 
   In my earlier remarks, I failed to mention BUD SHUSTER in the House, the chairman of their committee, and JIM OBERSTAR, dear friends of many years. What they and their colleagues have done is extraordinary. I think we have a superb bill. It is not a perfect bill, but it is, as in all things, the result of compromise. I think, generally speaking, we have a bill of which to be extremely proud. I know the Senator from West Virginia believes that very strongly. 
   Unless there are others who wish to speak, I hope our colleagues will vote to pass this conference report when the time comes this afternoon. 
   I yield back the remainder of my time.

   Mr. ROCKEFELLER. We have known a long time we have been underfunding our aviation system as a whole, particularly our air traffic control system, reforming the FAA--all the rest of it --building airports. 
   Overall, aviation funding is increased by 25 percent in this bill. It is a start. FAA operations funding is increased. Airport money is increased by 33 percent; air traffic control modernization is increased by 40 percent. 
   This is the first shot we have at making the airways safe for the American people. I urge my colleagues to support the bill. 
   Mr. President, I note Senator LAUTENBERG wanted to have 1 minute in opposition, but I do not see him on the floor. I do not know what to add further to that. 
   I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, as the ranking member of the Committee on Veterans' Affairs, I am enormously pleased that the Congress has passed this comprehensive bill which would make extensive changes to a wide range of veterans' benefits and services. This legislation is the culmination of extensive oversight and investigation, as well as the normal process of developing legislation--hearings and markups in both the House and Senate. Further, the bill represents compromise on both sides of the aisle and in both Houses of Congress. It represents many, many hours of staff and Members' work, and for that, I thank everyone involved. 
   The bill covers a wide spectrum of issues--from long-term care to new educational benefits for servicemembers. I will address some of the more substantive provisions. 
   Mr. President, H.R. 2116, as amended, represents a comprehensive effort to address the long-term care needs of our veterans. 
   We know that there is an expanding need for long-term care in our country, and in the VA, the demand is even more pressing. About 35 percent of the veteran population is 65 years or older, and that number will grow dramatically in the next few years. With this legislation, we are taking an important step forward for our veterans, and I am hopeful that it signals a new concern for providing long-term care for all elderly Americans. 
   For the first time, the VA will be required to provide extended care services to enrolled veterans. Section 101 directs the VA to provide nursing home care to any veteran who is in need of such care for a service-connected condition, or who is 70 percent or more service-connected disabled. In addition, the VA is directed to provide noninstitutional care, such as home care and adult day health care, to all enrolled veterans. This latter provision was included in the Veterans' Long-term Care Enhancement Act of 1999 which I introduced this summer. Within three years of the bill's enactment, VA would evaluate and report to the House and Senate Committees on Veterans' Affairs on its experience in providing services under both of these provisions. 
   Under the bill, the VA is also required to operate and maintain extended care programs so as to ensure that the level of extended care services is not less than the level of such services provided during fiscal year 1998. 
   Finally, in order to offset the cost of this new program expansion, the conference agreement requires new long-term care copayments for services exceeding 21 days in any year. Veterans who have compensably rated service-connected conditions and veterans with incomes below the pension rate are exempted from these copayments. Under this provision, VA would be required to develop a methodology for establishing the amount of copayments, taking into account the income of the veterans, the need to protect the veteran's spouse from financial difficulties, and the desire to allow the veteran to retain a personal allowance. Further, it was the conferees' desire that copayments would not apply to patients who are currently receiving long-term care services. 
   Section 102--also based on the Veterans' Long-term Care Enhancement Act of 1999 which I authored--mandates that the Secretary of Veterans Affairs carry out a series of pilot programs, over a period of three years, which would be designed to gauge the best way for VA to meet veterans' long-term care needs: either directly, through cooperative arrangements with community providers, or by purchasing services from non-VA providers. 
   While VA has developed significant expertise in long-term care over the past 20-plus years, it has not done so with any mandate to share its learning with others, nor has it pushed its program development beyond that which met the current needs at the time. Some experts even believe that VA's expertise is gradually eroding. For VA's expertise to be of greatest use to others, it needs both to better capture what it has done and to develop new learning that would be most applicable to other health care entities. 
   A key purpose of the pilot program would be to test and evaluate various approaches to meeting the long-term care needs of eligible veterans, both to develop approaches that could be expanded across VA, as well as to demonstrate to others outside of VA the effectiveness and impact of various approaches to long-term care. To this end, the pilot program would include specific data collection on matters such as cost effectiveness, quality of health care services provided, enrollee and health care provider satisfaction, and the ability of participants to carry out basic activities of daily living. 
   Another provision based on my veterans' long-term care legislation would authorize the VA to establish a pilot program for assisted living services. Assisted living is the last remaining gap in VA's long-term care continuum, and the Federal Advisory Committee on the Future of VA Long-Term Care recommended that VA be granted the authority to provide assisted living services. I urge VA to undertake this pilot program, as it will provide a basis on which to recommend expanding the authority. 
   Mr. President, earlier this year I joined with Senator DASCHLE as an original cosponsor to S. 1146, the Veterans' Access to Emergency Care Act of 1999. In June, I offered the provisions included in this bill as an amendment to a veterans omnibus measure being discussed at a Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs markup. The amendment was agreed to by a majority of the Committee members. 
   Just this week I was reminded of the need for better coverage for non-VA emergency care. The wife of a seriously ill veteran in my state of West Virginia called my office. Her husband is a non-  service-connected, low income veteran with no health insurance. Recently, severe chest pains sent him to a VA medical center. Because he is a cardiac patient and because he was in so much distress, his family wanted to call the rescue squad to transport him to the VA medical center. The veteran refused. Why? Because he had used the ambulance service before in an emergency situation, leaving the family with a sizeable bill that they are unable to pay. So, this sick veteran almost crawled to the family car, insisting that his family drive him. Once there, the VA medical staff told the veteran and his family that by not calling for an ambulance, the veteran was placed at risk. 
   Section 111 would authorize the VA to make non-VA emergency care reimbursement payments on behalf of enrolled veterans in all priority groups, provided the veteran has received VA care within a two-year period prior to the emergency and has no other health insurance options. 
   While this emergency care provision is significantly more restrictive than I had wanted, it is a valuable first attempt at ensuring that veterans who do not have other health insurance options--like the seriously ill West Virginia veteran who refused when his family tried to call for an ambulance--will be reimbursed for their non-VA emergency care services. In negotiating this provision, I was resolute in pushing for all enrolled veterans to have this coverage. I will be watching closely to ensure that this more limited emergency care provision is working for our veterans. 
   Section 112 is based on legislation introduced by Senator ROBB. It would establish a specific eligibility for VA health care for veterans who were awarded the Purple Heart. This provision is designed to provide priority for enrollment to these veterans who have no other special eligibility for care. 
   According to the Military Order of the Purple Heart, there are about one-half million veterans with this award. Roughly half of these honored veterans already would qualify for high priority care based on a service-connected disability or because of income. 
   The recipients of the Purple Heart award are American heroes, and I thank Senator ROBB for his leadership on this measure, which will ensure that the remaining 500,000 Purple Heart veterans will have unfettered access to VA health care services. 
   Military retirees have had a difficult time accessing various health care programs. Reductions in military treatment facilities, in particular, have restricted military retirees' health care options. Section 113 attempts to improve their situation. 
   Under the bill, the Secretaries of Defense and Veterans Affairs will be directed to enter into an agreement to allow for VA reimbursement for health care services provided to military retirees. Veterans who have retired from military service and who are not otherwise eligible for VA care will not be responsible for copayments. 
   In order to protect current enrollees, the Secretary must document that VA--in a given area--has the capacity in such an area to provide timely care to enrollees and has determined that VA would recover its cost of providing such care. 
   I am very pleased that House and Senate conferees were able to reach agreement on this provision to improve care for military retirees. 
   Section 117 is of particular interest to me as it addresses VA's specialized mental health services for veterans. 
   Last year, I directed my staff on the Committee on Veterans' Affairs to undertake a study of the services the Department of Veterans Affairs offers to veterans with special needs. Earlier this summer, I received the report my Committee staff wrote based on their 8-month oversight investigation, which sought to determine if VA is complying with a Congressional mandate to maintain capacity in five of the specialized programs: Prosthetics and Sensory Aids Services, Blind Rehabilitation, Spinal Cord Injury (SCI), Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders (PTSD), and Substance Use Disorders. I was dismayed to learn that because of staff and funding reductions, with the resulting workload increases and excessive waiting times, the latter two programs are failing to sustain services at the needed levels. 
   With specific regard to PTSD, VA has been moving to reduce inpatient treatment of PTSD, while expanding its use of outpatient programs. VA's decision has been fueled in part by studies of the cost effectiveness of various treatment approaches. The potential to stretch limited VA dollars to be able to treat more veterans is appealing. However, VA needs to be cautious before subscribing to the idea that outpatient care is as good as inpatient care for all veterans with PTSD. For some of the more seriously affected veterans--those who have not succeeded in 
   shorter inpatient or outpatient programs, are homeless or unemployed, or have dual diagnoses--longer inpatient or bed-based care may be a necessity. 
   Substance use disorders also present complex treatment problems and have taken the brunt of reductions in specialized programs. Some substance use disorder programs have terminated inpatient treatment completely, except for veterans requiring short detoxifications in extreme situations. While some medical centers have closed inpatient substance use disorder beds, they have worked to provide alternative, sheltered living arrangements. Unfortunately, not all facilities have made these efforts. Many have moved directly to the closure of inpatient units without first developing these other alternatives. 
   As an outgrowth of this oversight effort, I developed legislation to require that VA provide better care for veterans in need. I thank Chairman SPECTER for accepting this legislation and including it in S. 1076, the Veterans Benefits Act of 1999. 
   Under section 117, the Secretary of Veterans Affairs is required to carry out programs to enhance the provision of specialized mental health services to veterans. The conference agreement specifically targets services for those afflicted with PTSD and substance use disorders. The legislation also requires that $15 million in funding will be made available, in a centralized manner, to fund proposals from the VISNs and the individual facilities to provide specialized mental health services. The legislation specifically ensures that this $15 million in grant funding will be over and above what VA currently spends on these programs. 
   The focus of Section 117 is on expanding outpatient and residential treatment facilities, developing better case management, and generally improving the availability of services. Though not specifically mentioned in the legislation, I encourage VA to carry out programs for the following: (1) additional outpatient and residential treatment facilities for PTSD in areas that are underserved by existing programs; (2) short-term or long-term care services that combine residential treatment of PTSD; (3) dedicated case management services on an outpatient basis for veterans suffering from PTSD; (4) enhanced staffing of existing PTSD programs; (5) additional community-based residential treatment facilities for substance use disorder programs; (6) expanded opioid treatment services; and (7) enhanced substance use disorder services at facilities where such services have been eliminated. 
   In my view, VA's mental health treatment programs, in general, have been cut back to the point that veterans in some areas of the country are suffering needlessly. That is why I am so pleased that H.R. 2116 includes provisions to prompt VA to begin to rebuild some of what has been lost. 
   Section 201--based on the House bill--would allow the Secretary of Veterans Affairs the authority to set copayments, both for pharmaceuticals and for outpatient treatment. Currently, all veterans who are below 50 percent service-connected disabled, and veterans whose income is below the pension level, are required to pay $2 for each 30-day supply of medication. And all ``category C'' veterans are required to pay copayments based on the estimated average cost of an outpatient visit--currently $45.80. 
   The outpatient copayment rate needs to be adjusted. This charge is incurred each and every time a category C veteran receives outpatient care, regardless of the services provided. There is no doubt that $45 for a routine outpatient visit is unreasonable at best, and at its worst, may, in fact, discourage veterans from getting the primary care they need. I am confident that VA will study this issue closely and will  set the outpatient copayment to be more in line with managed care plans which charge either $5 or $10. 
   While I am supportive of adjusting the outpatient copayment, I have serious concerns about increasing the pharmaceutical drug copayment. The House Committee on Veterans' Affairs was adamant that the Senate recede to this increase to help offset the Senate-sponsored program expansions in long-term care and emergency care. And although the $2 per prescription charge that veterans are paying now may seem like an insignificant amount to some, I can assure my colleagues that to the veteran and his family living on a very limited income, it is quite significant. I hear from a number of veterans whose income hovers just above the pension level, who must pay the assigned copayment for their pharmaceuticals. Many of them are older veterans who are on a number of different medications for multiple medical conditions. 
   It is critically important that we do not place this segment of our veteran population in the same situation as many of our aging population receiving care in the private sector--having to choose between buying their medication or putting food on the table. 
   In an effort to prevent this from happening, I strongly urge the VA to set maximum monthly and annual copayment amounts which are sensitive to the financial situation of veterans for those who have multiple outpatient prescriptions. I will be closely watching the implementation of this provision to ensure that it does not impose an undue burden on our veterans. 
   While the Senate was not able to stave off the House in increasing prescription copayments, we were able to flatly reject a House provision to require copayments for hearing aids and eyeglasses. Such a provision would penalize veterans who are taking advantage of a needed benefit. 
   Section 206 extends the VA's program for the evaluation of the health of spouses and children of Gulf War veterans for four years. I pushed for the original legislation providing for these health evaluations after hearing about Gulf War veterans and their families who reported miscarriages, birth defects, and other reproductive problems. 
   Last year, the Congress modified this program to allow VA to use fee-basis care. It seems that these modifications are working well, as many new dependants have applied and are now waiting to be seen. 
   I am delighted that this program has been extended because the need for assessments continues. By this time last year, 2,800 dependents had applied for the program, and this year that total is up to 4,000. However, although 4,000 dependents have applied for the evaluations, VA has only completed 1,140 examinations. I urge VA to process these examinations as rapidly as possible. These dependents of servicemembers should not be delayed in their quest for answers. 
   Section 208 contains provisions to improve VA's enhanced use lease authority. I am delighted with these provisions, because I believe enhanced use leases are a critical component of VA's management strategy for its property. Many terrific projects that better serve veterans and assist the VA have been developed under this authority. By way of this legislation, we are encouraging VA to develop more enhanced use lease projects to leverage its assets, rather than begin to dispose of irreplaceable property. 
   Since VA received enhanced use authority, it has been used in a variety of ways. One approach has been to lease land to companies that build nursing homes where VA can place veterans at discounted rates, resulting in savings of millions of dollars. Another use has been to provide transitional housing for homeless veterans. Other projects have created reliable child care and adult day care facilities for VA employees' families, so that they can care for veterans without having to worry about the health and safety of their loved ones. In other locations, VA regional offices are moving onto VA medical center campuses, resulting in more convenient access for veterans and better cooperation between the Veterans Benefits Administration and the Veterans Health Administration. 
   Section 208 of H.R. 2116 would remove many of the current barriers preventing VA from having an even more successful enhanced use lease program. It would allow VA to enter into leases with terms of up to 75 years, rather than the current 20 and 35 years, while eliminating the distinction in lease terms that exists between leases involving new construction or substantial renovation, and those involving current structures. 
   I am very interested in seeing VA engage in more of these projects, so I am pleased to see that H.R. 2116 would require the Secretary to provide training and outreach regarding enhanced use leasing to personnel at VA medical centers. The bill also requires the Secretary to contract for independent assessments of opportunities for enhanced use leases. These assessments would include surveys of suitable facilities, determinations of the feasibility of projects at those facilities, and analyses of the resources required to enter into a lease. I hope that more training--which until now has been sporadic and provided primarily on a by-request basis--and a more systematic and centralized approach would assist the VA in maximizing its enhanced use lease opportunities. 
   While VA currently has a policy which allows for fee-basis care for chiropractic care, section 303 of H.R. 2116 requires the VA Under Secretary for Health, in consultation with chiropractors, to establish a wider VA policy on chiropractic care. While conferees have agreed that VA should establish a policy regarding chiropractic care, they have remained silent on mandating that VA furnish veterans with chiropractic treatment. Indeed, it is Congress' intent that this provision not be read as an endorsement for chiropractic care. 
   Complementary and alternative medicine, including chiropractic care, are important aspects of health care. I urge VA to use this opportunity to develop a policy on all forms of complementary and alternative medicine. In particular, the report ``VHA Complementary and Alternative Medicine Practices and Future Opportunities'' recommended that VHA consider providing acupuncture, following guidelines set forth by the National Institutes of Health, since NIH has already approved acupuncture as an effective treatment for back pain. 
   I am extremely disappointed that the House would not move the Senate Montgomery GI Bill (MGIB) enhancement legislation. The Senate passed MGIB enhancements on three occasions this year, but the House did not respond.

   Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I rise today to join a bipartisan group of my colleagues in support of the John H. Chafee--Foster Care Independence Act of 1999. 
   My friend and colleague John Chafee will be honored numerous times in the coming years for his extraordinary public service to both the state and country that he so loved. He should be. There will be many fitting ways to pay him tribute by advancing the many causes important to him. 
   Enacting the fundamental principles of his bill into law today will be one small way that we can all honor a man who was an outstanding member and statesman in a way that I think he would appreciate because it helps some of our citizens who are most in need. 
   Senator Chafee has been a tireless champion for children and young people who need a voice, and occasionally some muscle, for many years. I had the privilege to work with him on just some of his efforts to help children, and in particular, to help repair and improve our adoption and foster care policies. 
   Senator Chafee's unflagging commitment to vulnerable young people was  exemplified by his work on the legislation now before the Senate. Just a few days before his death, he approached me personally to talk about what we could do to ensure that this legislation would pass into law this year. 
   I also believe that John himself would not agree with honoring him as a motive--he would expect us to pass this legislation for the teens in foster care who need and deserve more help. On October 13th, Senator Chafee and I held a subcommittee hearing on this bill, and it was our last hearing together. John was engaged in talking to the teens at the hearing and after listening to them, he knew that fighting to get this bill done was the right thing to do. 
   Since John cannot fulfill this vision, I am grateful to the Republican leadership for carrying forward in his name. Senators NICKLES, LOTT, and other members of the leadership have worked very hard to make this one of the final bills we will pass in 1999. 
   Our First Lady, Mrs. Clinton, has also been a special leader on behalf of vulnerable children. In 1997, she helped focus the national spotlight on the need to promote adoption. This year, she has helped to focus much needed attention on the challenges facing teenagers who age out of foster care, and has challenged us to improve the system for such teens by expanding the Independent Living program. 
   I am keenly aware of the child welfare work that remains. I have worked closely this year with Senator GRASSLEY and understand the concerns that he has about the need for greater accountability and independent oversight for our nation's child welfare system. Senator GRASSLEY believes that there must be independent review of the foster care system, and he is advocating that every state establish Independent Foster Care Review Boards composed of volunteers. I have agreed with Senator GRASSLEY that this is a worthy strategy and I am committed to continue working with him next year as we seek innovative and effective ways to better serve all of our nation's abused and neglected children. 
   In addition to Senator GRASSLEY'S concerns, there are other issues in child welfare that need continued work. That is why I have also worked with Senators DEWINE, LANDRIEU, and others on a bill that will strengthen our child abuse and neglect courts, and another that will ensure that all abused and neglected children with special needs are eligible for adoption subsidy. These are just a few of the steps we need to take in 2000 and beyond. 
   While we still have much to do, we have made some progress. We have been pleased to learn that one of the desired outcomes of the 1997 Adoption Act, moving children more swiftly from foster care into permanent homes, has begun to become a reality. Adoptions throughout the country are up dramatically, far exceeding expectations. In September, the President announced that 35 states had exceeded their goals for adoption placements and received bonus payments as a result. This is wonderful news for America's foster children. 
   Yet, at the same time, it's disturbing to know that approximately 20,000 young people each year who turn 18 and ``age out'' of the foster care system suddenly face the cold and often cruel consequence of no home, no family, no medical coverage and no system of support in place. In my own state of West Virginia, only 185 of the more than 1000 foster children over the age of 16 were able to get additional help through the state's Independent Living program.

   Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I thank my distinguished senior colleague who has been daunting and relentless in his pursuit of his amendment, which is a very good amendment, an amendment which deserves to be passed. 
   What is fascinating to me has been said before by others. I will go back to the letter from John Podesta at the White House, the Chief of Staff to the President. He said that any solution that would undercut water quality protection under the Clean Water Act, or under SMCRA, the Surface Mining Control and Recreation Act, simply is unacceptable, and that the President's opposition to appropriations riders that would weaken or undermine environmental protections under current law would be unacceptable. 
   I emphasize as strongly as I possibly can he is wrong in that statement. The fact that he is wrong in that statement is of the utmost importance to our colleagues if they or their staffs are listening as they come to a decision about this amendment. If he were right, that would be an entirely different matter. However, he is not right. To make it perfectly clear, we have included that in the legislation that Senator BYRD and Senator MCCONNELL put forward. I will read it again for those who may not have been listening before: Nothing in this section modifies, supersedes, undermines, displaces or amends any requirement of or regulation issued under the Federal Water Pollution Control Act or the Surface Mining Control Reclamation Act of 1977. 
   It would be law. It is the case, in any event. We added this not because we thought it would be fortuitous to add it, not because we needed to add it, but because it was true at the outset. We did it to make the point even clearer for those who would raise this point. 
   Senator BYRD made the points most clearly and most powerfully. This amendment, on which we are asking for support, simply puts into law the memorandum of understanding which I hold in my hand, which has been signed off by the Environmental Protection Agency, by the Office of Surface Mining in the Department of Interior, and by the Corps of Engineers. The signatures are here--the signature from the Environmental Protection Agency, a very high senior official, the signature from the Regional Director at the Office of Surface Mining, the signature from the brigadier general of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and the signature from an official in West Virginia. 
   The point is the Environmental Protection Agency has approved, and the OSM and the Corps of Engineers have approved and given their official written stamp of approval in writing, right here. This equals this amendment. There is no difference therein. I am not one who either baits or ridicules the environmental movement nor do most of my colleagues. 
   This country is constructed under the republican nature of its form of government as a system of checks and balances. I have a tremendous interest in health care public policy. I spend a lot of time being upset with the Health Care Finance Administration called HCFA. There are people, obviously, who are upset by EPA. By and large, I  think EPA tries to do within its own understanding the best job it can. By and large, I think one of the reasons the environmental condition of our country is gradually improving, although slowly, is because some of those people take positions which are not popular with members of this body or the other body or with Governors or with the public. I do not ridicule what they do. 
   However, I do think they know in their hearts that what Senator BYRD and Senator MCCONNELL and some of the other Members are trying to do is completely consistent with the intent of Congress, in fact, in the case of SMCRA, for over the last 20 years. 
   Let me say this before I talk about the importance of mining in West Virginia and the problems of simply potentially eradicating coal mining--not just across West Virginia and Kentucky but, if this were to be extended and this were to catch fire, eradicating the potential for the 57 to 60 percent of electricity which is fueled by the use of coal across this country--that there is a balance. I recognize, sometimes when people say that, people say that is a word they use to get out of this situation or that situation. But this country has to run on a balance. One cannot simply say to southern West Virginia, to central West Virginia, to northern West Virginia, to other parts of our country: We are going to make these enormous changes, very radical in their content today because tomorrow will be a new day, because transition in America somehow just simply happens, and we move from one sort of a core industry type of economy in West Virginia to a modern, totally smokeless type of economy, and there does not need to be any interruption. So we will come in and we will stop this business called mountaintop mining. 
   In the process of that, we are probably, unless this amendment is agreed to, going to stop much of the underground mining of West Virginia and Kentucky and the 13 to 16 States in this country that produce coal because the effect under the law, under the judge's rule, says this can happen. 
   I want my colleagues to understand something about my State of West Virginia. We are not on the coasts. We do not have the advantage of the trade that flows to the Atlantic coast or the Pacific coast. We do not have the advantage yet, entirely, of the access that comes from the interstates that cut through our mountains and would allow us to become part of the flowing economy that so much of the rest of the Nation simply takes for granted. But most importantly, let me say to my colleagues, and let them hear this, please, with understanding: Only 4 percent of the land of West Virginia is flat. Only 4 percent of the landmass of West Virginia is flat. All of the rest of it is going uphill or going downhill, either at great steepness, very great steepness, or somewhat lesser steepness; it is not flat. Only 4 percent is flat. 
   Imagine, then, trying to construct an economy, an economy developing, much less the life of schools, the life of families, the life of recreation, the life of a State, on 4 percent of the land and then moving up the side of hills, where one can do that, and hoping the winter will pass quickly because it is very hard to plow those roads. It becomes a very difficult situation in the southern part of our State. 
   You cannot simply say we mine coal today and we do biotechnology and information technology tomorrow. You cannot walk across the Grand Canyon in one step. 
   Senator BYRD and the junior Senator from West Virginia, together, in different ways, have been trying very aggressively, over the last number of years, to modernize the economy of West Virginia. We have been doing so with a respect for our basic industries--steel, chemicals, coal, wood, natural gas, et cetera--but also understanding that the world is changing, that we are globalized. This Senator has spent the last 15 years making trips back and forth to various Asian countries, trying to globalize the economy of West Virginia through reverse investment and through the increase of exports. Indeed, the increase of exports in the last 5 years has gone up by 50 percent in West Virginia. So we are making 
   progress. 
   But we do not start from the base that so many other States have. So what happens in southern West Virginia if the Senate or the Congress turns its back on this amendment is something I would like people to think about. We would lose approximately $2 billion in wages. Senator MCCONNELL, in his very good remarks, mentioned 4.1 percent of people are unemployed in this Nation. That is not true in the part of the State that we are talking about, in West Virginia. The counties I would mention would be six. In McDowell County there is over 14 percent unemployment today. The reason it is not higher is because so many of the people who were there have left. If they had stayed there, the figure would be much higher. 
   In Mingo County, which has a lot of coal reserves of very high quality--that is high Btu, low-sulfur-content coal--it is over 14 percent, over 14 percent. The national average is 4.1 percent--that is terrific, in Connecticut, Colorado, other places. I am proud of that, happy for that. But in Mingo County it is 14 percent. In Boone County it is less than that; it is 13.9 percent. A lot of our low-sulfur, high Btu, highly desirable for the making of steel coal is produced in that county; Logan County, 13.5 percent; Lincoln County, almost 11 percent; Wyoming County, almost 11 percent. 
   Can one understand what that means to me as a human being, much less as a U.S. Senator, when one struggles in land which is so steep, so desperately steep, land which used to be, many millions of years ago, higher than Mt. Everest? Because that is what the Appalachians were; they were the tallest mountains in the world. Over these millions of years, they have been ground down, but they have not been ground down to a level where economic activity is readily accessible. We cannot put the great big highways so easily into that kind of terrain. 
   Senator BYRD has done a remarkable job in trying to do that. But not all those roads have been built, and only a couple of those have been built in southern West Virginia because the cost per mile is so prohibitively high. Even if the Federal Government provides the money, the State can't match it. So progress is slow. 
   I also want to say something that is very important to me personally. This Surface Mining Act goes back to when I was Governor. The Senator from Idaho made those comments. I did not agree with everything the Senator from Idaho said, incidentally, about either the Environmental Protection Agency or other things, but I agree with the thrust on what he wants to do with this amendment. But I was Governor of West Virginia at that time. We were faced with this question of what we were going to do about surface mining and the Federal act. 
   I will say two things. One is that I have known for a long time, and I have been told by many people in and out of government, that a good deal of the Federal act was based upon what it was that we were doing, what it was I was causing to happen as Governor in West Virginia, in the way that surface mining was carried out. In other words, West Virginia, I will then say from that statement, has a higher level of requirements of surface mining than do other States and higher, in general terms, I might say, than the Federal Government. 
   But I also want to say Cecil Andrus, who is from the West and was tough--he was a tough Department of Interior Administrator, Secretary of the Interior--gave West Virginia something called primacy on surface mining. 
   All of this we are talking about--surface mining being the opposite of underground mining; anything that is not underground is surface; whether it is mountain mining or surface mining, it is all up above the ground--he gave us primacy. We were the first State in the Nation and the only State for quite a period of time to receive primacy. 
   What he was saying by that is that you in West Virginia do your surface mining reclamation so well that we are going to give you the authority to go ahead, and we will back out of it completely; we have no jurisdiction anymore; you have jurisdiction unless you start to do things which are wrong. Then we will take it back. 
   I was very proud of that. That caused me to have some of the views I have today. 
   When we talk about not gutting the Clean Water Act or not gutting SMCRA, we in West Virginia cannot afford to gut, so to speak, those Federal  acts in a far more intense way than most other States because if we do, we are hurt by them much more than other States because of the enormously mountainous, hilly nature of our State, with only 4 percent of it being flat. All the rest of it goes up or it goes down at one level or another. We have to respect the laws. 
   Mountain mining has changed a bit over the years in the sense that it has gotten rather larger in the area it covers. Most of us in Congress understand that mountaintop mining in West Virginia is never going to be the same. In fact, the congressional delegation in the House and the Senate wrote an article in the West Virginia papers in which we said it is true, it never is going to be the same. 
   It may be possible we cannot afford to have, as far as the mountains are concerned, these enormous areas that are mined all at once. But when somebody comes along and says, oh, you should do that, you should restrict the size because you can't fill valleys, they are wrong. Under the Federal law, they are wrong. The Federal law specifically provides for that. I will not read it. I will simply hold it up. Here it is in SMCRA. It specifically provides for being able to do valley fill. 
   If the Federal judge who made this decision in West Virginia wants to eliminate that--but then again, in his opinion recently, he said: Nothing I am saying here is anything on the basis of merit; it is all on the basis of saying we want a little peace and calm so that the Federal Government, the Congress, can litigate on this matter and decide what needs to be done, which is why Senator BYRD, Senator MCCONNELL, and a number of us went ahead with this amendment. 
   We did have a system whereby the two sides--I do not even like to use the words ``two sides''--the environmental community and the industrial community, could come together and work together. We had a system in which one of the people who works with me spent 5 weeks in the coal fields working with the environmental people, working with the State people, working with the mining people, working with the union people. They came very close to almost a total agreement on what should be done. There was only one area on which they could not reach final agreement. It was something called a buffer zone. They could have reached a final agreement. Then the Corps of Engineers came along and blew the whole thing out. 
   I appeal to my colleagues to understand there is a role and a place for reason, compromise, balance, and sensible action in all of this. This world is not divided between people who are strictly environmental in their purposes and people who are strictly for jobs in their purposes. There has to be that balance. 
   Global warming is a fact. I do not dispute the science. I look around me; I feel the temperature; I understand what is going on. On the other hand, at the same time I have those 
   feelings in my bosom, having to speak grown up as an adult, as a VISTA volunteer in the southern coal fields of West Virginia, that these people who are mining coal--the coal miners Senator BYRD talks about so eloquently--are doing what they know how to do and doing it the best way they possibly can. 
   If we are not able to get our amendment accepted, if the judge lifts the stay, if his decree goes into effect, mining will more or less cease to exist in West Virginia because nobody will invest; nobody will say: All right, let's just wait for a couple of years and then we will come back and look at West Virginia. That will not happen. It will be more or less the end of mining in West Virginia, not just in southern West Virginia, but it will probably be all over West Virginia because everywhere there are effects of the judge's opinion. 
   We have to have both. We have to have a way for people to provide the electricity the Senator from Idaho talked about to turn on those computers. We have to have a way to light up this Senate and to light up the homes of people all over America. As I indicated, 57 to 60 percent of all the electricity in this country is made by coal. It is not made by nuclear power. It is not made, at this point, by natural gas. It is made by coal. It is a fact of life. Reasonable people understand that. 
   You cannot just obliterate that and pretend there are not going to be consequences. Nobody wants economic devastation. I do not think any of our colleagues want economic devastation on the State of West Virginia. I do not think that is in their hearts; I do not think that is what is in their minds; but that is what is in the process of happening unless this Byrd-McConnell amendment is, in fact, agreed to and becomes part of the national law. All it will do is put into law precisely what the Environmental Protection Agency, the Office of Surface Mining, and the Corps of Engineers have officially signed off on as policy. 
   The stakes are tremendously high in West Virginia, and the stakes are tremendously high not only in Kentucky but all across this country. This is kind of a watershed decision we are about to make. Are we going to find some kind of a compromise, a way of working things through, or are we going to deem each other to be enemies, one to another, one on one side, one on the other--one environmentalist, who either feels or is deemed to feel they have no interest in jobs--which I doubt because environmentalists are people, too--or on the other side coal miners who then turn on environmentalists as being totally hostile people. All that does is degrade the content of public discussion and degrade the possibility of a reasonable resolution. 
   I hope very much this amendment will be adopted. I regret very much the White House has been so difficult on this whole matter, having given their word to the senior Senator from West Virginia and then reversed it the next day, having given their word on matters of steel during the course of a campaign in the northern part of our State and then reversed their view on that. 
   One almost wonders whether or not there is an assault that is taking place on West Virginia. 
   But we are struggling. We know that along with two or three other States, we have more economic problems than any other State in the country. We live with that. We live with that every day. We try our very best. Senator BYRD, and this Senator, and our congressional delegation, try our very best every single day to try to improve the economic situation of our State, bringing in new industry that does not create any kind of pollution or industries that are entirely smokeless and entirely of a new order. But it cannot be done, as Senator BYRD said, overnight. 
   So you cannot have a crashing decision which descends on the good people of southern West Virginia and northern West Virginia that deprives them not only of their self-respect but of their ability to eat, to get medical care, or to exist as human beings. 
   We have not distinguished ourselves in this country in taking men or women in their 40s or 50s or 60s, and saying: All right. You are finished as a coal miner. Now we are going to train you to do something else. We talk about it all the time, but we do not do it. We do not know how to do it. The Canadians do; we do not. 
   So to banish people into oblivion is not something which is common with the practices of the soul of America, any part of the soul of America, or any part of the soul of this body. That is what would happen, however, were this amendment to fail. 
   I commend to my colleagues the integrity of the Byrd-McConnell amendment; I commend to my colleagues the honesty and the environmental soundness of the Byrd-McConnell amendment; and I commend to my colleagues the enormous crisis which potentially will take place if it fails because, as has been said, what starts in West Virginia--because this has now been picked up by the national movement--will move from State, to State, to State, to State.

    Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I rise today to honor three West Virginia individuals who have recently been awarded ``Adoption Angel'' awards by the Congressional Coalition on Adoption. Larry and Jane Leech and Judge Gary Johnson are truly ``angels'' in adoption. 
   President Clinton recently proclaimed November ``National Adoption Month''. It is a good time to re-commit ourselves to doing all we can to ensure that all children have the opportunity to grow up in safe, stable and permanent homes. 
   During Adoption Month in 1997, the Adoption and Safe Families Act, a bill I sponsored, was signed into law. This act, for the first time ever, made children's safety, health and opportunity for loving, stable families the paramount factors to consider when planning for children in foster care. The act provided incentive bonuses for states successful in increasing adoptions. 
   My state of West Virginia has made a lot of progress in moving kids out of foster care and into permanent homes. When the adoption bonuses for 1999 were announced, I was proud that West  Virginia, because three of our state's children. Brian, Shawn and Sarah Keane, had the honor of introducing President Clinton the day the bonuses were announced. The 3 Keane children along with 208 more West Virginia foster children moved in with their adoptive families in 1998. 
   Our State is working hard to increase public awareness of adoption and children needing homes. A quarterly newsletter, ``Open Your Heart, Open Your Home'' features stories of waiting children and successful adoptive families. In May, Dave Thomas came to West Virginia for the third annual Foster and Adoptive Parent Recognition Day, to recognize adoptive parents who provide homes for children with special needs. 
   We have been able to make this progress largely as a result of the efforts of the individuals who were honored by the Congressional Coalition on Adoption, and other dedicated and hard-working West Virginians like them. Let me tell you a little about these ``angels''. 
   Larry and Jane Leech have been foster parents for many years, opening their home and their hearts to children in need of both. Working with the West Virginia Department of Health and Human Resources, the Leeches adopted a sibling group of three young boys, twins age 4 and an older brother, age 6, in 1998. Now, a year later, the Leeches are again in the final stages of adopting another sibling group--this time, three older girls. Mr. and Mrs. Leech also have three biological children. They have a tremendous amount of love and a strong commitment to all nine of their children. Recently, the Leeches and their children visited the West Virginia Governor's mansion where they were honored by First Lady Hovah Underwood, for their commitment to children in need. 
   Judge Gary Johnson believes that all children in the foster care system deserve permanent homes. As the 28th Judicial circuit judge, elected in 1992, Judge Johnson has worked closely with the West Virginia Department of Health and Human Resources. He meets with them quarterly to review problems or identify issues that prevent children in West Virginia from achieving permanence in their lives. Judge Johnson continually increases his own knowledge of the issues by attending conferences on child welfare. 
   The progress we have made since the passage of the 1997 Adoption Act is significant. Certainly the 211 West Virginia children who found families last year, including the six children who now call Larry and Jane Leech ``Mom'' and ``Dad'' know that. But over 400 West Virginia children are still waiting and hoping to be adopted--over 100,000 children in our nation are still waiting and hoping to be adopted. Too many of these chilldren are growing up in the insecurity of foster care. Too many of them are becoming teenagers without a permanent family. 
   And that is why we need ``National Adoption Month''. We need opportunities to honor the angels in adoption like the Leeches and Judge Johnson. And we need the opportunity to publicly re-new our commitment to ensuring that all children have the opportunity for permanent adoptive homes. 
   I am pleased to join the other members of the Congressional Coalition on Adoption in honoring more than 50 ``Angels of Adoption'' from around the country. I am doubly pleased that 3 of these angels are from West Virginia. And I pledge to continue to work on legislation that will help all of West Virginia's, and America's foster children have the opportunity that the Leech children now have, the chance to grow up in a permanent, loving family. 
   I urge my colleagues to dedicate themselves to this effort as well.

   Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I salute the veterans of this nation. On this Veterans Day, I want to pay tribute to the brave American soldiers who fought long and hard battles so that we may all have our freedom today. Veterans Day is about honoring and remembering these men and women who served our Nation, and it is for their families. 
   I am very fortunate to represent a state where military service is held in such high esteem. And well it should be. I can't tell you how proud I am of all West Virginia veterans. Whether they served in wartime or peace, all made great sacrifices. Indeed, West Virginia has one of the highest percentages of veterans of any state. 
   As I have often said, it was knowing and understanding West Virginians' deep patriotism and loyalty to their state and their country that first led me to seek a seat on the Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs, where I am now the Ranking Member. I am proud to serve veterans there. 
   The very fabric of our nation is wound through our veterans. Iwo Jima and Hamburger Hill, defeating Nazism and turning back Communism, punishing the brutality of Hitler, Saddam Hussein, and Milosevic. Our nation is truly a beacon to the world for freedom and for opportunity because our men and women in uniform held that beacon aloft. And many of those men and women in uniforms were West Virginians. 
   It is not enough to take a day to commemorate these veterans, however. We owe them more than that. It is our responsibility to refuse to turn our backs on veterans who need health care, education benefits, and compensation for injuries incurred in service. It would be truly disgraceful for these veterans, who have served our country so well and so valiantly, to feel that they have been forgotten except for this one day per year. That is why I take my work with and for veterans so very seriously. 
   I have fought very hard this year for veterans not only in West Virginia, but across the Nation. A critical need for veterans is long-term care. Our veteran population is aging rapidly and it is our responsibility to care for them. We owe them good long-term care now. I am dedicated to this need, and have been working hard to achieve this provision for all veterans. 
   And there are other battles to be fought as well. Although veterans who enroll with VA for their health care receive a very generous standard benefits package, there is no provision for comprehensive emergency care. This is a serious gap in coverage for veterans, which is unacceptable. Large and unexpected emergency medical care bills can present a significant financial burden to veterans. 
   Abraham Lincoln spoke at Gettysburg of dedication to ``unfinished work ..... thus far so nobly advanced.'' Indeed, it is true that we have work to complete. In order to truly commemorate our veterans, I hope my Senate colleagues will join me in my continuing battles for veterans.

   Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, yesterday, I introduced the Phone Bill Fairness Act. Consumers across this country have to deal on a regular basis with telephone bills, and one thing they do understand is that telephone bills are very complicated and frustrating. But what they may not know is that telephone bills are, to them, more than just an annoyance--they may be costing them quite a lot of money. I want to address that issue very briefly. 
   When the average consumer receives their phone bill, they don't get a sheet of paper; they get dozens of pages, with very small type, filled with confusing acronyms, complicated payment schemes, and sometimes even services they have not signed up for at all but for which they are being asked to pay. I imagine most consumers not only don't understand everything they have received, but after reading a few pages into their bill--if they do that--they give up and just hope, so-to-speak, they are getting what they want. 
   Now, the Telecommunications Act of 1996 was based on the idea competition and market forces would lead to lower prices and better service. We have begun to see the benefits of that act in certain respects. New companies and newly competitive incumbents have begun to reduce rates and offer innovative new services. That is to the good. The main beneficiaries of these improvements, however, have been business consumers. They have the expertise to analyze the bewilderingly complicated telecommunications market and to find out what are the best deals for them. That is exactly what they wanted because they have the size and scope to figure out what is going on and proceed to do what is in their best interest. 
   But your average phone user does not have a team of lawyers or accountants who can pour over his or her phone bill to determine the plan or the company that will save them the most money, which is what competition is about; thus, they cannot use the market system to their financial advantage. Unfortunately, phone bills become so complicated, and the array of services and phone plans so bewildering, that it really does take lawyers and accountants to understand and maximize the benefits that are intended. 
   So, on the one hand, the Telecommunications Act is working because it has created the opportunity for consumers to get lower rates and better service, but it is not working because it requires consumers to walk through a complicated and highly uncertain maze to finally get to that opportunity. 
   Once simple choices about telephone service have become so complicated that even the Chairman of the FCC, Bill Kennard, who was our foremost expert on telecommunications matters, himself has expressed frustration over reading his own phone bill, I think we have something we need to consider. 
   We may not be able to reduce the complicated nature of telecommunications competition, but at the very least we can provide residential consumers with a roadmap that leads  them through the maze of telecommunications. We must give consumers help, guidance, and be helpful to them in making sure they can understand their telephone bills and the options they have in telephone service so they can take advantage of the benefits of competition in the telecommunications world, just as businesses can do on a very regular basis. 
   Therefore, the Phone Bill Fairness Act tries to do this by the following: 
   First, we require all telephone companies to accurately describe charges that appear on bills. No one should be able to misidentify so-called line items, especially by claiming they are ``federally mandated'' when they are not federally mandated. 
   Secondly, our bill would require all telephone companies to tell their customers exactly what their average per-minute rate is for a month, so they can compare it to the rates of other companies. Is that so strange? Not at all. When a customer goes to a supermarket, they can look at unit prices for groceries and, thus, they can shop and compare. That allows them to buy what is best for them in terms of what they want, in terms of price and quality, and that is competition. Why can't we do this for telephone customers? The answer is, of course, we can. 
   Thirdly, we would require that all telephone companies inform customers of their calling patterns in an understandable way. If customers know what they are paying and know what types of calls are most frequent, they will then be able to compare all of the different company plans and find the one that is right for them. Again, the Telecommunications Act of 1996 was about competition. This bill is about competition. 
   Finally, the bill gives the Federal Communications Commission and the Federal Trade Commission the power to explore how to make phone bills easier to read so that we don't do it here in Congress, and to determine whether any telephone companies are committing fraud in their billing practices. I don't mean to suggest this is the common practice, but there are some small phone companies that do something called ``slamming,'' and that is fraud. They charge people for things they have not, in fact, signed up for. That is fraud. The best defense against fraud is an informed consumer. Consumers cannot be well-informed if they do not understand their phone bills. So this is all fairly logical and straightforward and, I think, in the interest of the Telecommunications Act and, more important, of the American people. 
   Consumers are terribly frustrated with how confusing phone bills are today. When consumers get frustrated, they assume the worst. I believe we have an obligation to try to do something about all of this, and I believe we can. I still very much believe in the Telecommunications Act. I voted for it and participated in shaping it. I believe in the benefits of competition, but we need to make sure the benefits of competition reach everybody in the country--business consumers, residential consumers, and everybody. The first step to achieving this goal is making sure every consumer not only has the opportunity to get better rates and services but that they also have the knowledge and the power to actually get what they want at the lowest price. 
   I yield the floor. 
   I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I come to the floor, after many of my colleagues have already said magnificent things, to say a word about a man I revered, worked with, and cherished both in personal and professional terms. That is, of course, John Chafee. There are so many reasons I respected and, in a sense, really loved John Chafee, and do to this minute and always will. 
   Many of them had to do with what it was that he didn't say and what it was that he didn't find a need to do. There was an interesting article in the Washington Post this morning by Mary McGrory that made me think back to the time I was in the Peace Corps. I served with a man who has since died by the name of Marty Grobli. We were working on the Philippines program together. He was an enormous hero of the Battle of the Bulge in World War II. He had done works of heroism which I never learned about because whenever as a young person in my early twenties I tried to ask him, because I wanted to learn about it, he said he didn't want to talk about it. I think that is the way of many who have been through searing emotional and physical experiences of danger, of patriotism, of great personal risk--they simply keep it to themselves. There isn't a need to tell others. War is not pleasant. War is destructive; war is carried out in the interests of the Nation or of many nations against one or several others. 
   John Chafee never felt a need. In fact, in all the years I knew him, I never heard him talk about serving in two wars, World War II and the Korean war, or the fact he was a marine. If one looked at John Chafee, particularly in the latter years, one wouldn't necessarily--unless you looked at that chiseled face--say this was a marine in the sense that one thinks about it in classical terms. He was not into looking tough, acting tough, or being tough--he just was tough. But he was tough on behalf of people he loved, whom he represented in Rhode Island, those he didn't directly represent, although he did as a Senator in the form of children and women and the inheritance of whatever quality of environment we will inherit in our country. 
   He was a steward of all of those things. He was ferocious in the way he fought for them. He never pushed himself forward. It always seemed, watching him on the Finance Committee when he was in a hearing conducting questioning, he was searching for truth, not either to show knowledge, of which he had a deep, deep repository, or to show special seniority. It was always that he was interested in what the witness was saying, reflecting on what the witness was saying, being courteous to the witness, tough on the witness where the witness might be withholding information or not fully disclosing some of the other arguments that might have been brought through that witness' answers. 
   I loved him for those qualities. I had no idea, I think as no one did, that this was going to be his fate. I didn't look forward to the fact he was going to retire, but since he announced he was going to retire I looked forward to the fact he would go back to Rhode Island, his beloved Northeast, to prowl his State, to be with the people who stood by him in all the years. 
   As the Senator from South Carolina knows, John Chafee was also a Governor. I was a Governor, and I think Governors bring to this body a particular ability and desire to want to reach a compromise to find a solution. The Presiding Officer was a Governor. And Governors often can't allow themselves to tarry because of an ideology. 
   They can't tarry on simply a petulant feeling about this situation or that person because they are the only person in that State, be they man or woman, who can resolve the situation. Therefore, they have to seek a compromise. They have to seek a solution. I love that quality in a Senator. It is a quality John Chafee had in just an unparalleled amount. 
   So he never got to go back home. I feel very sad about that. I wanted to think about John Chafee at home, enjoying the fact he was looking back on all of his years of national service and public service and enjoying his grandchildren, his children, Ginny, his beloved State of Rhode Island, and all of the Northeast. He was a remarkable person. 
   I quote another thing Mary McGrory said which I liked so much:  
   In an institution that calls every man a gentleman, he really was one.  
   That kind of puts us in our places. But it also very much says something accurate about John Chafee. I have heard him talk to people sharply. But it was always on substance. It was always on issues. It was always on what it was between himself and a resolution to a policy problem that he cared about. 
   In the leader's chair sits the Senator from Iowa, Mr. GRASSLEY. He and I will remember, because we were both there,  it was only last week--which is the heartbreaking part of it--that Senator John Chafee, as the senior member of the Finance Committee, was conducting a hearing on independent living. That is the problem caused when children are brought up, often abused by their parents or by others, through a foster care system, and then all of a sudden at the age of 18 they are declared independent. 
   Our colleague, the Presiding Officer, the Senator from Ohio, is also very interested in this problem. John Chafee was quizzing the young people who were there, who had come through the system--many, many foster parents, some of whom had worked, some of whom had not--but they had been, at the age of 18, declared independent. They were just cast out. They lost their health insurance. They didn't know how to open a bank account, not necessarily even how to operate a washing machine, and they said that to us in very clear and compelling ways. 
   I thought it was in situations such as that--I think my friend from Iowa will agree with me--that John Chafee was at his best. He was in his 70s. Yet he focused so much of what he did heavily on children who were in their fourth and fifth year, or in their teens. It was a burden and a passion that never relented. 
   The Senator from Iowa, Mr. GRASSLEY, and I are working very hard with our staff and the Finance Committee staff to try to complete that independent living bill, not simply--because that would embarrass him--as a way of honoring John Chafee, but, frankly, because John Chafee would be on us to do it. Knowing he is not here to do it himself, we intend to do that and we will do that. We hope it will pass this body and the other body and be signed by the President. 
   John Chafee's health is something I have to comment on because I always thought of him, and do think of him, as so strong. I wondered, as many of us did in the last several months, what was it that caused him to seem to become so fragile so quickly? But because I knew John Chafee and had known John Chafee, I always believed it would pass because John Chafee 
   always came back. He was always there. He was frail because he had back surgery, but that was not going to lead to something else. It was simply something he was going to get over and come back and take his place over there, behind where the flowers are placed on his desk, and resume his work. 
   That is what John Chafee did. He did not retire when he was in his late 60s. He certainly was financially independent enough to do so, but he didn't retire because he wanted to work. He loved public policy. He loved helping children and families. He loved health care. 
   I can remember during the Clinton health care debates, it was classic John Chafee because we would go on Sunday television shows and he and I would have a wonderful conversation--before. We had different views on the legislation. We would have a very warm conversation before and then he would, during the course of the interview, proceed to shred me mercilessly, in good Marine fashion; you know, using good facts and good examples. Then, as soon as it was over, he would go back and we would be amiable. 
   I commented to him on that several times, and he just would sort of brush it off. He was doing his work. He was doing the work he was here to do. 
   When we think of children in this country getting health insurance, let us remember John Chafee because it was John Chafee who drove that. It was called the Children's Health Insurance Program--CHIPs. And Laurie Rubiner, his staff person, drove that. They were driving this independent living bill. There were so many things he did for people of all sorts. 
   I haven't even mentioned, except very briefly at the beginning, the environment. 
   John Chafee was also a very independent person. I do not say this as a Democrat; I say this as a Senator. I liked so much the fact that he was so ferociously independent of his own party when he chose to be; of his own party when they applied pressure on him; from his constituents, presumably, when they applied pressure on him. He always did what he thought was right. In the longer day of life, if you are who you are and you stay who you are, people will come in your direction. If you bend to other people's wills and people have a sense of that, then there will never be a need for them to come in your direction because they will sense, if they outwait you, they will prevail. 
   You could not do that with John Chafee, whether it was because he was this incredible person from Rhode Island and Northeast, this son of early America; whether it was because he was a marine; whether it was because of his own particular and unique nature--he never backed away from anything. 
   John Chafee was a great figure of the Senate. I am not in the position at this point to rate great figures in the Senate over eras. But I certainly start with the idea that John Chafee was and is one of those. I think he was an inspiration. He inspired me. I felt better when I saw him, when I was in his presence. I felt more motivated. I felt better about everything because he just did that to you, whether he was on his cane, as he was in the last month or so, or whether he was vigorous, as he was always before that. He enriched the lives of so many. He seemed to care very little about his own comforts, but, on the other hand, he was so devoted to his family. 
   In closing, I want to think about Ginny; I want to think about his children; I want to think about his grandchildren; I want to think about his staff, people who must be absolutely devastated now, all of them, each of the categories of people close to him, whom I have mentioned. I want them to know they were related to, married to, children of, grandchildren of, and working for, a really very great American. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I join my colleagues, Senators DURBIN, HATCH, SANTORUM, BYRD and HOLLINGS in introducing the Fair Trade Law Enforcement Act of 1999. Unfortunately, because of the long and important debate on campaign finance reform last Friday, I was unable to make a statement with the rest of my colleagues when the bill was introduced. However, I stand today to praise this legislation which will take significant steps to update and enhance critical U.S. trade laws. It has been far too long, well over a decade in fact, since the last general reform of our trade laws, and current circumstances--including global recessions, economic turmoil and our surging trade deficit--necessitate the prompt action of Congress. 
   The trade laws in question, particularly the safeguard, countervailing duty and anti-dumping laws, are vital to the manufacturing sector of our economy. They are often the first and last line of defense for U.S. industries injured by unfairly or illegally traded imports. Companies, workers, families and communities rely heavily on these laws to prevent the ill-effects of unfair trading by our trading partners. Unfortunately, recent events like the steel import crisis have demonstrated how painfully inadequate our current trade laws are in responding to rapid import surges. The flooding of U.S. markets with unfairly or illegally traded goods causes severe and often irreparable harm to our workers and domestic injury, and it is high time we revisit our trade laws in an effort to make our laws more responsive to the changing landscape of the global economy and international trade. 
   The reforms we are proposing today fall into three categories. The first are improvements to our safeguard laws. Current U.S. safeguard standards are often more strict than the corresponding standards in the WTO Safeguards Agreement. This means U.S. manufacturers are playing at a disadvantage to their foreign trading partners. Whereas a foreign trading partner must prove only that an import surge, like the steel import crisis we have seen since July of 1997, is a cause of injury, domestic producers are hindered by U.S. trade laws which require our domestic industry to prove that the imports are a substantial cause of injury. This inequity hampers the ability of our domestic industry to receive relief from unfairly traded imports, and creates an unequal playing field on which our foreign trading partners have an advantage. It also contributes to making the U.S. the dumping ground for illegal and unfairly traded imports. Our trading partners know the U.S. standard is high, and they exploit that fact. This bill simply brings U.S. safeguard laws with respect to causation standards and injury factors into line with WTO laws, and puts our domestic industries on equal footing with the rest of the world. 
   Second, this legislation amends our anti-dumping and countervailing duty laws. It establishes a presumption of threat and of critical circumstances when imports surge and prices fall to an extraordinary degree. A critical circumstances determination, which is provided for under WTO standards, allows the ITC and the Department of Commerce to apply relief to imports entering before the preliminary determination in a trade case when investigating authorities find a history of injurious dumping or such a dramatic surge in imports that, absent retroactive relief, the effect of an anti-dumping measure would be severely undermined. One of the proposals in this legislation simply provides for the Department of Commerce and the ITC to apply these rebuttable presumptions when drastic import surges are coupled with sharp domestic price declines. Again, these presumptions are rebuttable, meaning all of our trading partners have the right to appeal the determination of threat or critical circumstances. All this provision suggests is that we give our domestic industry the benefit of the doubt regarding the injury they are suffering when huge spikes in imports are accompanied by a rapid decline in domestic prices. We saw first hand last year how effective the presumption of threat and critical circumstances can be. When the Commerce Department determined critical circumstances existed on numerous steel trade cases, the decline in imports for the following months was immediately visible. The specter of a retroactive tariff or duty is a powerful deterrent to continuing unfair and illegal trading practices. 
   This bill makes still other improvements in our anti-dumping and countervailing duty laws. Our legislation will make it tougher for our trading partners to circumvent an anti-dumping or countervailing duty order. No longer will foreign nations be able to skirt around our laws by making slight alterations to the products they are exporting to the U.S. We clarify that these AD/CVD orders include products that have been changed in only minor respects. The captive production clarification is an important provision to ensure fainrness as well. 
   Also, the Fair Trade Law Enforcement Act of 1999 prevents AD/CVD cases from being terminated by suspension agreements against the wishes of the injured U.S. industry. As we saw during the steel crisis, the Administration reached suspension agreements on trade cases that the domestic industry was confident of winning. Those cases would have provided significant relief for the injured U.S. steel industry by imposing tariffs and or duties which would have ``priced out'' many of our guilty trading partners from the U.S. steel market. Instead, foreign nations which were facing the prospect of having zero or very restricted access to the U.S. market were guaranteed a significant share of our market as a result of negotiated suspension agreements. The reforms in this bill will require the consent of a majority of the injured industry, both companies and workers, in order for the suspension agreement to be finalized. This particular piece of the bill has already been reported out of the Finance Committee, and it is critical to ensuring that any domestic industry injured by unfair or illegal imports is afforded proportional relief. 
   Finally, this bill also creates a steel import monitoring program designed to act as an early notification system when imports begin flooding the U.S. market. When the steel import surge began in July of 1997 it was many months, even close to a year, before anyone in the Administration would even admit that the spike in imports was occurring and that it was potentially harmful to the domestic industry. During that time businesses went bankrupt and thousands of employees were laid off. The amendment we propose in this bill will make it much 
   easier to track imports and will provide much quicker notification of potentially harmful import surges. Quite simply, the sooner we learn of unfair import surges, the sooner the Administration, Congress and the industry itself can take the necessary steps to provide the industry, companies and workers with the relief they deserve. 
   This bill being introduced today provides much need adjustments to our trade laws. Too many of the provisions  currently designed to provide relief to our domestic manufacturing sector have been antiquated by recent changes in the global economy and the structure of international trade. It is time we reaffirm our commitment to our manufacturing base by updating and enhancing the very laws designed to protect U.S. manufacturers from unfair and illegal imports from abroad. 
   I should note to my colleagues that I remain an ardent supporter of open and fair trade. Exports have become an engine of growth for the U.S. economy. The numbers speak for themselves. Last year, Americans exported over $688 billion worth of goods and services. In saying this, I proudly can point to my own state's experience, and how it proves in a powerful way that we must pursue the opportunities of the global economy. In the past decade, West Virginia has gone about, deliberately and energetically, changing its perception of the outside world in a way that has had tremendous economic payoff. In just the past five years, our exports have increased by 40%. We have large and small companies alike exporting to China, Korea, Taiwan, and Japan. These companies exported over $2.2 billion worth of goods just last year. In percentage of products made which are exported abroad, West Virginia ranks 4th among all 50 states. Perhaps the most stunning number to me is that every billion dollars in exports supports about 17,000 U.S. jobs--that means that more than 35,000 jobs in West Virginia are directly linked to exporting. 
   I know that trade is critical to my state's continued economic development. West Virginia's case proves that even small economies can use expanded trade opportunities as a mechanism for further growth and prosperity. However, our increasingly globalized and ever expanding economy requires our finding new ways to adapt to change. Americans thrive in that environment and will therefore excel in this New Economy. But transitions are almost always hard. I think how a country deals with the dislocations of change says a lot about its priorities and about its ultimate success as we move into a new world and a new century. 
   I fully recognize that much in this bill will provoke debate. I welcome it. The Finance Committee can and must begin to consider how best to update our trade laws. I am confident that as trade becomes unquestionably one of the most powerful economic determiners in our economy, we will do so. 
   My efforts to deal with the real world consequences for West Virginia steel families, communities and manufacturers when they were hit with an unprecedented deluge of steel imports in late 1997 and 1998 resulted in my proposal of a steel quota bill that was considered on the Senate floor and rejected largely on the grounds that we weren't playing by the world's rules. I'm here to let my colleagues know that as the world changes, we must change with it--we must support the expanded opportunities for trade by guarding against the acquiescence to circumstances where our workers end up hurt with no recourse but to promote isolationism.

   Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, millions of Americans live and work abroad. While living abroad, they continue to pay taxes and vote. They are Americans, and they want and deserve to be counted in the decennial Census. In order to achieve this important goal, we must plan and prepare. 
   The legislation introduced today directs the Secretary of Commerce to use existing authority to conduct a special census of Americans abroad in 2003 to determine how to include this population in the next decennial Census in 2010. While we wish that Americans abroad could be part of the 2000 Census, there unfortunately not the time or opportunity to do so. But it is vital that we act now to ensure that plans are in place for the future.

   Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, obviously, this Senator from West Virginia is already a cosponsor of the amendment. There are very few people who would know the situation in this amendment as well as the Senator from Maine. Her State, as many rural States, has had a major reaction to deregulation. Economic development is always the first thing on the minds of States that are trying to grow and attract their population back. This is simply asking for a commission to study the effects of deregulation on economic development. I think it is very sensible. I think it highlights a real agony for a lot of States. It is highly acceptable on this side.

Mr. President, I say to my friend from Oregon, there is no plot or underlying purpose not to accept the amendment at this point, but there may be others who have amendments that relate to this area. Let's see what we have. From this Senator's point of view, the Senator from Oregon has made a useful amendment and, at the appropriate time, should there not be any problems that arise--I do not anticipate them--I will have no problem.

   Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I would just make a couple of comments in general and not direct it to those who are trying to decrease or increase slots at airports but some philosophical points. 
   A lot of these rules were set, as has been pointed out, some 30 years ago. Of course, there has been a lot of technology which has developed since that time, and a lot of it which has been in place since that time which allows much more efficient use. We don't have so-called ``buy and sell'' situations anymore. We have slots. 
   We also have, as I described in my opening statement yesterday, millions of Americans who fly every year, and 1 billion people will be flying in the next decade. We have a tripling of air cargo. We have an enormous increase in international flights. We have an enormous increase in letters and boxes, all of which require flights and all of which require slots. They go to different airports. But the point is everything is increasing. 
   I don't think that any of us on the floor or colleagues who will be here to vote on various issues can pretend that we can turn around and say: All right, Mr. and Mrs. America. Yes, you are making more income. Yes, you are maybe vacation-conscious. Yes, this is a free market system. Yes, you live in a free country and you want to fly to more places and you have the money now to take your children with you. You are writing more letters. You are sending more packages because more services are available. 
   We cannot pretend as though we are going to stop this process. I don't want to make the comparison to the Internet because the Internet has a life of its own. But it comes to mind. There are a lot of people who want to stop some of the things going on on the Internet. They can't do it. The Internet has a life of its own. It is the result of the free enterprise system that people decide to buy it or not buy it. That is their choice. 
   But people also have the choice as to whether they want to fly or not. We are now coming to the point where we have the technology to allow a lot more of that to happen. 
   I described a visit I made to the air traffic control center in Herndon, VA, which is highly automated and has the highest form of technology. If you want to say: All right. How many flights are in the air right now from 3,000 to 5,000 feet? How many are in the air now from 5,000 to 7,000, or 5,000 to 6,000? They push a button, and they can tell you every flight--because I have seen it--every flight in the country at certain levels. 
   The whole concept of being able to increase flights is going to be there. 
   No. 1, we have established the fact that Americans are free. This is not the former Soviet Union. People have the right to fly. They have the money to fly. The economy is doing better, and exponentially everything is growing. That case is closed. 
   If somebody wants to say, let's stop that, let's just say we are going to pretend it was 30 years ago and only so many people can fly, only so many letters can be written, only so many international flights, the Italians and French are going to have to stop, it is OK the Japanese and Germans do it--life does not work like that. People have the right to make their decisions, and it is up to us in Congress to expedite the ability of the FAA to have in place the instruments, the technology, and the funding to make all of this work properly. 
   I point out one economic thing that comes from the Department of Transportation which is very interesting. This happens to deal with O'Hare. That is an accident; it is not deliberate. But it makes an interesting point because it talks about the benefits if you open up slots and it talks about the deficiencies; there are both. If you open up more slots, you will get a benefit for the consumer that outweighs the total cost of the delays and, in short, the consumer will save a great deal of money, or a certain amount of money, on tickets. They will save money because there will be more competition, because there will be more slots, because there will be more flights. That is the free-market system. That is what brings lower costs. 
   I do not enjoy flying from Charleston, WV, to Washington, DC, and paying $686 for a flight on an airplane into which I can barely squeeze. 
   Let's understand, we have something which is growing exponentially and happens to be terrific for our economy. As I indicated, 10 million people work in this industry. You are not going to stop people from sending letters. You are not going to stop people from flying. You are not going to stop people from taking vacations. You are not  going to stop international traffic. None of that is going to happen. We have to accommodate ourselves. 
   Does that mean there is going to be somewhat more noise? Yes. 
   Does that mean we have to improve systems, engines, and research that are reducing that noise? Yes, we do. 
   Does that mean there are going to be more delays? Probably. 
   But the alternative to that is to say, all right, since we cannot have a single delay and nobody can be inconvenienced a single half hour, then let's just shut all of this off and go back to the 1960s and pretend we are in that era. We cannot do that. We simply cannot do that. 
   I introduce that thought into this conversation. There will be other amendments and other points that will be made about it. But we are dealing with inexorable growth, which the American people want, which the international community wants, which is now supported by an economy which is going to continue to sustain it. Even if the economy goes through a downturn, it is not going to slow down traffic use substantially because once 
   people begin to fly, they keep on flying; they do not give up that habit. 
   We are dealing with a fact of life to which we have to make an adjustment in two ways: One, we have to be willing to accept certain inconveniences. I happen to live in one place where the airplanes just pour over my house. I do not enjoy that, but I adjust to it. 
   Let's deal in the real world here. Flights are good for the economy; flights are good for Americans; flights are good for the world. Packages and letters are all part of communication. There is nothing we are going to do to stop it, so we have to make adjustments. One, in our own personal lives, and, two, we in Congress have to make adjustments by being far more aggressive in terms of expediting funding for research, instruments, and technology that will make all of this as easy as possible. 
   I thank the Presiding Officer and yield the floor.

   Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, each Member of the Senate will vote on the Robb amendment as they see fit. I want to simply make a philosophical statement, which I made earlier but will make it again. 
   The fact that passengers, planes, parcels, international flight activities, planes in the air, and planes on the ground are either going to be doubling, tripling, or quadrupling over the next 10 years is obviously not now in effect but has everything to do with the future of what it is that our airports are willing to accept and what it is that those who live around our airports are willing to accept. 
   To stop aviation growth, to stop aviation traffic, passengers, packages, new airlines, and new international flight activity is to try to stop the Internet. It is something you might wish for, but it is not going to happen. In fact, it is not something we wish for because it is good economic activity. Ten million people work for the airline aviation industry, and many of those people work in and around the airports where those airplanes land and take off. 
   My only point is, we cannot expect to have progress in this country without there being a certain inconvenience that goes along with it. We have become accustomed to having our cake and eating it, too, and that is having our airports but then having a relatively small number of flights landing or a slotted number, in the case of four of our major airports, landing, but then the thought of others landing becomes very difficult. 
   Atlanta, Newark, and many other large airports do not have any slots at all. The people 
   who live around them survive. They hear the noise. They do not like it. The noise mitigation is getting much better as technology improves, and the safety technology, if the Congress will give the money, will get even better than it is. It is virtually a perfect record. 
   I simply make the observation that slots are a difficult subject. They are very controversial because people prefer quietness to noise. But in a world that grows more complex in commerce, in which the standard of living is increasing enormously, one cannot have the convenience of travel, the convenience of packages, the convenience of letters, the convenience of getting around internationally, and the convenience of many new airplanes and expect to have everything the way it was 30 years ago hold until this day. 
   I thank the Presiding Officer and the chairman of the committee and yield the floor.

   Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I want to speak a moment to my colleagues. The Senator from New Jersey has indicated he wants to send a strong message to the airlines. I do, too. In fact, over a period of a number of months, a number of us have negotiated a strong message. What we did not do, however, is prescribe exactly what it was that would take place with each and every one of the problems. We forced them to report to us through the Department of Transportation with the inspector general monitoring and watching. 
   I have no objection to part of what is in this amendment, but what the Senator from New Jersey gets into is the most careful kind of mandating: If it is more than 2 hours late, such and such; if it is 4 hours late, such and such penalty. It goes on. Sometimes it is three times the value of the ticket--it just depends for what it might be. 
   In other words, it is precisely the opposite of what we approached the airlines to negotiate with in a very hard fashion. For example, they are going to have to reply to us on notification of known delays, cancellations, diversions, and a lot of other subjects, and they are going to have to do it within a prescribed amount of time, to which they have agreed. 
   We are going to increase penalties for consumer violations under which this amendment falls. I say to the Senator, I do not have any problem with him putting forward the purpose of his amendment. I do have a problem and urge my colleagues to have a problem with prescribing exactly how much would be paid according to which number of hours and how long the delay was. That is what we have tried to avoid. 
   The Senator, from the beginning, has not been for that approach, but that approach is what we have agreed to with the 
   airlines. I ask the Senator if he will be willing to take out on page 2, from line 9 through page 3, line 6--if he will be willing to modify his amendment to that extent?

I believe that the Gorton slot provisions as originally proposed was good policy that I intend to support in conference. Both Senators HARKIN and GRASSLEY  have worked hard toward the development of the slot amendment concerning O'Hare and the New York Airports and their interest is well noted and I intend to do what I can in conference to provide for a mechanism along the lines that they proposed be agreed to in the conference.

   Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I thank my distinguished colleague for those very generous comments. I feel no obligation to argue with him at this point. He and I have been on the floor many times before, sometimes successful, sometimes not. Today and tomorrow we hope to be more successful. Always I rely on the intelligence and the articulation of the good Senator from the State of Washington. 
   We are dealing with a new bill and a substitute for it which will come up shortly. Ordinarily in these matters, one doesn't talk about either Senators or staff or anybody else until everything is over. However, I think it would actually set a good tone for this debate if I thanked a few of my colleagues upfront. One, it may put them in a better mood; two, it will discharge a duty which I believe I have. 
   I have been very frustrated by this whole process because it has taken a long time and I don't like temporary extensions. We have had a history of short-term extensions. The FAA has suffered, the airports have suffered, my State has suffered, the Senator's State has suffered, a lot of it during the course of this past year. 
   My frustration spilled over as far as the junior Senator from West Virginia is concerned a few weeks ago when I came to the Senate floor and poured out my frustrations about the whole troubled state of our air traffic control system and the potential impact on our national economy, as well as the impact on my State and a lot of other things which I characterize as being fairly scary in terms of delays and congestion on what I consider to be an already enormously overburdened system. I am frightened about the prospects for the future. What we will do today is by no means the end of what we must do in the future. 
   Today I am feeling very good. It is very good to be on the floor. We are on the floor for a reason. We are on the floor introducing the Air Transportation Improvement Act of 1999, which we all know and love as the FAA and AIP reauthorization act. 
   The chairman of the Commerce Committee, JOHN MCCAIN, and the ranking member, FRITZ HOLLINGS, have been working around the clock with Senator GORTON and myself--the latter two being on the Aviation Subcommittee--to work out a number of long, lingering conflicts, some of which still linger but most of which do not with respect to this bill. 
   The majority leader and the Democratic leader were both extremely helpful and were very personally involved, showing their strong commitment to  aviation by finding time in a very busy fall schedule. I do not know how long it will last, but a potential 2 days is generous, and I respect and appreciate that. 
   A whole host of other Senators have constituents who care enormously about this whole question from a variety of points of view--access to air service, lack of access to air service, noise, all kinds of other issues--and have been willing to roll up their sleeves and work very hard to find a compromise. I want to name some: Senator SCHUMER; the Iowa Senators, HARKIN and GRASSLEY; Senator WYDEN from Oregon; the Virginia Senators, both ROBB and WARNER; the Illinois Senators, both DURBIN and FITZGERALD. Everyone has had to give a little, and it hasn't been easy. I hope everyone has also gotten a little, and, in some cases, some have gotten quite a lot. 
   First, I extend my thanks to my colleagues and to the leadership for putting the Senate in a situation for a fair debate. We have at least gone this far. There is a lot of work to do, but first things first. As we begin Senate consideration of the FAA reauthorization bill, I am optimistic we can proceed in good order. I think we can do this in a couple of days. 
   I tend to think at a fundamental level the cooperation and hard work I have seen reflects a deep and abiding sense of responsibility on the part of my colleagues, which they can hardly ignore in the first place, for the continued safety and efficiency of our aviation system and the condition of our air traffic control system which is unknown to most but ought to be feared by all. 
   We have a number of issues to debate here, some of which, as I indicated, are still in controversy. The vast majority--and I think my colleague will agree--have been fully worked out and have been agreed to on all sides. ``All sides'' become very important words. Not all, but a majority. 
   Aviation, as my ranking chairman indicated, is a proven engine of economic growth in this country. People don't think of it that way. Similar to universities, sometimes people think of them in different ways. It is an enormous economic engine. Each day, 2 million people travel on U.S. commercial airlines and a quarter of million do the same thing on smaller, private planes that transport people for business. Sometimes they do it simply for the sheer pleasure of flying. 
   Every day and night, U.S. airlines carry more than 10 million packages and overnight letters. Every day, more than 10 million Americans go to work in aviation-related businesses. Ten million Americans? Yes. That makes America among the largest manufacturing exporters of any enterprise. To the great credit of the aviation industry and the Federal Aviation Administration, projected growth for aviation is unparalleled. Within 10 years, U.S. airlines will be carrying more than 1 billion passengers each year; that is up more than 50 percent from the records that were carried last year. The number of aircraft in the air, on the ground, moving about, will increase by 50 percent in the next decade. That can make you happy; that can also make you nervous. 
   The regional fleet, which is something I care about enormously, because that is the connection in the whole hub and spoke system, a connection which is very important, will grow by more than 40 percent. Worldwide, air cargo will more than triple. These are incredible figures, projections of which the FAA and the industry can and should be very proud. 
   Of course, there is a catch. We have to be able to handle this air traffic, and we have to be able to handle it safely, in order to realize this growth. By most accounts at the FAA and at airports across the Nation, we are simply not ready to do this. In fact, we are having trouble staying on top of the system. With every year and every month that we allow ourselves to fall further behind in our modernization effort, there are times when one wonders will we ever catch up, will we ever understand what it means to put into place a full infrastructure for an air traffic control system so we can take this doubling and tripling I have talked about before. 
   That is why, as Senator GORTON indicated, it is so critical we in Congress hold up our end of the bargain by making improvements where we can and provide a system with some kind of predictability. The FAA reauthorization bill is all about starting to chart a course for growth, with a focus on increasing efficiency, improving customer service, and facilitating competitive access, all the while staying focused on strengthening our strong safety record. 
   This is a 4-year authorization bill. It will cost about $45 billion in total in aviation funding. That sounds like an enormous sum. It is, but it is not. It is because it is. It isn't because it will not do the job, but it will help us. It will get us started on the right path. 
   Ours is an enormous and complex aviation system. People don't stop to think about it. They take it for granted. They did not take it for granted when there was enormous traffic congestion to get to the Redskin Stadium a couple of weeks ago, and they did take it for granted when there seemed to be none yesterday. I wasn't at either game so I have no idea. But people tend to take for granted things which they use frequently. That is not something we can afford to be doing in Congress. 
   For now, let me note this $45 billion authorization includes roughly $10 billion for airports under the Airport Improvement Program, $24 billion for the FAA's nearly 50,000 employees and for air traffic control operations, and $10 billion for air traffic equipment as part of the whole modernization effort. 
   Let me share some of the highlights of the bill and the agreed-upon committee substitute, which I believe Senator GORTON and I will want to introduce momentarily. In terms of changes in aviation law and policy and innovative new programs, the package includes some of the following: an important agreement worked out with the majority to authorize an increase of $500 million for the FAA's Air Traffic Control Modernization Program. We are grateful for every $50 million, $100 million, and $1 billion we can get our hands on. 
   Mr. President, $500 million is an increase; it is more than it was, and we are glad. There is an emphasis on improving air service to something we call small communities, which I imagine would be of interest to the Presiding Officer. That increase will take various forms such as an increase in the minimum Airport Improvement Program entitlement from $500 million to 
   $650 million annually, a new $80 million pilot project to assist small communities that are struggling to restore air service, and an immediate and, hopefully, lasting priority for new service opportunities at the four slot-controlled airports: O'Hare, LaGuardia, Kennedy, and Reagan National, and a ban on smoking on all international flights to and from the United States. Here, actually, I give special thanks to the tireless efforts of Senator DURBIN. 
   There is whistle-blower protection for airline and FAA employees so none will fear losing their jobs for pointing out safety violations or concerns that are pertinent. This is an item Senator KERREY from Nebraska has been preaching on for quite a while. There is a series of specific safety improvements such as new runway incursion technologies and stronger enforcement of hazardous materials regulations, and a significant new agreement on noise and environmental issues arising from aircraft that fly over our National Parks. In one case, we have an airport in a National Park--only one, thank heavens. This reflects several years of very tough negotiations among Senator MCCAIN, Senator BRYAN, and others. 
   In addition, through the amendment process, I know we will be considering, and hopefully taking action on, several other very important provisions. For example, Senator GORTON and I will offer a painstakingly negotiated agreement among all parties for an overhaul of the slot rules at the four high-density airports: Reagan National, Chicago O'Hare, New York Kennedy, and LaGuardia. Under this deal, the slot rules will be phased out over time--phased out over time--in New York and Chicago. This was a rather bold idea at the time, put forward, actually, by the Secretary of Transportation last spring. Most important, from my perspective, these changes offer us an opportunity to increase access to these key airports. Once again, I am thinking of the constituents of the State of  the Presiding Officer, and that is the name of the game: Can you get into some of these larger airports? This will give an extra boost of service to small communities and to new entrant airlines. 
   Several of us, further, will join together to offer an amendment to protect airline passenger rights--Senator GORTON and I and others will do that--to hold the airlines' feet to the fire on their promise to improve customer service and to reduce customer complaints. This last summer, I thought, was almost historic, not that it seemed to have enormous effect but it was a historic example of what happens when you get gridlock in the air. People were held up. It was all during the summer travel months. That period of time is going to keep growing as the congestion grows greater and greater. 
   Another amendment Senator GORTON and I will offer will propose incremental FAA management reform--that is something we feel very strongly about--and an innovative financing piece for air traffic equipment. 
   Finally, I expect we will see some amendments and debate related to airline competition. That will be controversial, the question of whether and how we should strengthen Federal competition laws and policies as they apply to the airline industry. 
   In closing, obviously, there are other important provisions in this bill. I will not go through them in full. Suffice it to say, Senator GORTON and I believe this is a truly balanced package, an inclusive FAA and AIP reauthorization package. There has been a lot of consulting, a lot of negotiating--an enormous amount of negotiating. I think it is a good bill. 
   I am glad to join my colleague, Senator GORTON, in offering the committee substitute today on behalf of ourselves, the chairman and ranking member, at the appropriate time. I look forward to the debate on it. 
   I thank the Presiding Officer.

   Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Madam President, I fully agree with my colleague from Washington. In fact, I have a whole series of pages about various States, various airports, various Senators, and the problems they had--and in one case may still have--with whom we worked out agreements. This was a very arduous process. 
   An airport is a very large employer when one is talking about the number of planes that can fly in and fly out. Every flight, in fact, represents two slots, a landing and a takeoff. It was a very controversial subject. This is probably the most controversial subject, but we worked a long time to try to work this out. We did it, as the Senator indicated, with an expedited review process in certain places, we did it in good faith, we did it slowly, and we did it over a period of time. We did it, we thought, trying to accommodate as much as possible the needs of individual Senators who, quite naturally, take these things particularly seriously. The Presiding Officer and I wish we had problems of this sort, but for those who do, it is a real problem. We recognized that, and we tried to deal with it in a fair manner. 
   First, I will not give the full explanation my colleague did, but I will say it is carefully crafted, it is based on compromise, and it balances both the questions of congestion and of noise. There are those who feel strongly about both or one or the other in various proportions. Obviously, all of them represent high-density airports, although it should be said there are a lot more than four high-density airports. Atlanta, for example, is neck and neck with O'Hare in terms of its density, but is not included in the high-density treatment. 
   I thought the handling of Reagan National was good because we went from 48 slots to 24 slots; 12 outside the perimeter and 12 inside the perimeter. That is good for the Presiding Officer and the present speaker because that allows more entrants into National, and that is desirable. 
   It also is a fact that this was in the original bill, and it was retained in the substitute. That speaks to something within the authorizing context. In other words, people on the Commerce Committee overwhelmingly believed this was a very important and fair treatment. 
   We did not make the treatment of every airport exactly the same in terms of the phasing out of the high density rule because not every airport is the same. We did not do it as a collection of our own air genius or mathematical equations; we did it because the FAA advised us very carefully as to what we ought to do on that according to their best calculations. The idea was, instead of gradually phasing out the high density rule altogether, to, rather, establish some interim rules to allow small communities--this is a very important point--to allow small communities and to allow new entrants to get a head start on this process. 
   If you come from rural America and if you believe in a competitive market system, that becomes extremely important. Small communities do get a head start to add flights and fill capacity in this compromise which has been worked out. 
   I have explained the Reagan Airport situation. 
   The amendment, again, specifically protects service to small communities--which is of interest to many of us--under slot exemptions that were previously granted by the Department of Transportation. 
   It requires that airlines continue the service until 4 years after the lifting of the high density rule at O'Hare--until the year 2007--and 2 years after the lifting of the high density rule at Kennedy and LaGuardia for that purpose. 
   Understandably, some Members were very concerned. When we began to talk about this, they were very worried it would come off that the airlines, therefore, would have no incentive to keep any of their business in smaller communities or in smaller markets; that they could simply pick up their slots and take them elsewhere. 
   This amendment prevents them from doing that. It prevents them from abandoning these markets unless, as Senator GORTON indicated, they can prove to the Department of Transportation--which will be under the majority of this body, which is rural or part rural in nature; a lot of pressure--that they are suffering, as they say, substantial losses on these routes. So that is a clear effort to protect service for small communities, and that is something which I value very much. 
   As Senator GORTON also explained, this amendment expands the definition of a ``limited incumbent.'' These carriers are already serving one of the four high-density airports, but do so with only a very few number of flights. This was of particular value to many of our Midwestern colleagues. There are a whole series of them who, I think, are quite happy as a result of this. 
   The new definition will give more low-fare, new-entrant carriers access to these major airports. Again, I go back to the philosophy of all of this that, after all, we do have 15, 18 major airports in the country, but fundamentally we are a hub-and-spoke system. And the Presiding Officer and the junior 
   Senator from West Virginia come from States that are spokes; we are not hubs. We never will be. We depend upon carriers that are in the hubs coming out, as they compete in this most competitive of all businesses--in our market system--to compete for new passengers. So they, in classic fashion, have to increasingly come out into the rural areas to draw passengers into their hubs. There will be an amendment about the nature of these hubs to attract them, so they can put them into the bloodstream, so to speak, the flow stream of their business. 
   In my opening statement, when I talked about the enormous increase in new regional jets which will be taking place in the next number of years, that is one of the reasons the number of these regional jets will be increasing--because they are being sent from hubs out to the smaller areas to pick up passengers, to bring them into the larger hub airports, and then going on to wherever they wish from there. 
   One very important thing. I am not sure the Senator from Washington said this or not; he probably did, knowing him. There is an important caveat for any change in the high density rule. This is not just something the Congress has such power to decide that we just abrogate or pretend the FAA does not have ultimate understanding of what constitutes safety in a system. 
   The FAA retains the ultimate authority for air traffic operations, and they have the ability to step in because of safety or delay. They can intervene. They can intervene when they think there is a problem or a crisis. And they can do so on a unilateral basis. 
   In addition, I might add, both the General Accounting Office and a number of economists, over a lot of years, have pointed out that slot rules, in effect, act as a major barrier to airline competition. That new entry at four airports--there are a lot of people who cannot get into those airports because of the slot rule. Again, the FAA would have to maintain the sureness of safety, and the rest of it, but you want people to be able to get in and out of airports. 
   As to new technology, if we would only make available the money, they have all kinds of new ways now of charting courses for airplanes, be they commercial or private, which allow a more efficient use of airspace, which we cannot now do because we do not have the technology. Each computer in all of these many centers across the country does not have the ability to differentiate the altitudes or whatever some of the other details are that allow the plotting of air courses. So there is room for more, and in not only the four  high-density airports but also generally speaking. 
   Then, finally, this amendment does require noise studies. Noise is a factor. Noise is not the only factor in life, but it is a factor. It gives priority to high-density airports. There is the allocation of money for those noise abatement studies. 
   So I think it is a very good amendment. It certainly is a long-worked-at amendment. I urge my colleagues to join in the adoption of this amendment. 
   I thank the Presiding Officer and yield the floor.

   Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Madam President, I agree with everything my colleague from Washington has said. I should say that he and I began working on this amendment in earnest a number of months ago when we were in the midst of the summer and the headlines were full of all the problems of the air traffic control system, which were becoming manifest to anybody reading a newspaper, watching television, or listening to the radio. 
   When I use the word ``troubled'' to describe our air traffic system, I need to be very careful and clear because the FAA, our air traffic controllers, the pilots, and flight attendants in this country have had an air safety record that is extraordinary. It is not only safe but it is a very secure air traffic operation. So people say: Fine. Then why worry about the future? 
   As I explained in my opening statement, the future is going to bring double, or triple, or quadruple virtually everything--whether it is air cargo, letters, passengers, numbers of aircraft, international traffic, and the rest of it. 
   Let me assure my colleagues that the word ``troubled'' is not about safety, although we always have to keep our eye on that, but it is about productivity, about capacity, about efficiency, about outdated equipment, about insufficient runways, and insufficient runways that are insufficiently distant from one another; if there happen to be two, or if they happen to be parallel, you can't use them efficiently to land two airplanes at the same time. It is about surging traffic demand, about fractured organizational structure, and it is about us in the Congress; it is about a highly unpredictable, highly irregular process of funding. 
   Funding the FAA and its air traffic control operation is not at all unlike running IBM or Dell Computer. You are meant to have a business plan, a 5-year outlay of budget, and you are meant to know what kind of equipment you can buy 1 year from now, 2 years from now, 3 years from now, so you can begin to prepare for that. We in this Congress, have specialized in declining to make that ability available to the people who fly 2 million of our people around every day. So what Senator GORTON and I have done today is not to offer, as he indicated, dramatic reform or restructuring of the FAA, because we know there is a lot to be worked through, that it would be premature to do that today. 
   In fact, on the floor of this body and in the Halls of this Congress, there is very little discussion, if any, on what ought to be discussed at great length about the FAA--about equipment, about computers, about what is the state of stress, or lack of stress, for the people who are in our towers, whom both the Senator from Washington and I have visited. 
   So we are trying to decide how best to proceed on FAA restructuring, and we have decided to try to get as much consensus from the Congress and industry and across the Nation as we can. Now, some believe we should create an independent FAA, a privatized FAA. Some believe we should privatize air traffic altogether. Some believe user fee funding is the key to improving efficiency. Some believe the FAA is slow and cumbersome because it is a Federal agency. And some believe they are kind of on the right track already, so why intervene--again, no catastrophic actions. 
   In any event, despite the fact that we are not ready to enact--Senator GORTON and I--a so-called big-bang solution, in no way is there reason to do nothing. It is to take steps to make air traffic control next year better than this year or 
   next year for the FAA to be better than this year. It is clear that the FAA needs interim reform and interim direction and encouragement. So as the Senator indicated, we are offering a package of incremental reforms that will, in a sense, send the FAA both the tools and the message to improve current management and operation of the system without prejudging what the final long-term broad change might be. 
   The Air Traffic Improvement Act of 1999 is focused in two key areas, as my colleague discussed. The first is internal FAA management reforms, and the second is modernization of equipment and technology. Both are enormously important. On the management side, the bill builds on reforms enacted in 1996. It uses the management advisory committee, or MAC as it is called, which I will have to say the administration has not set records in putting in place, i.e., they have not. But they have said they are going to send the nominations for it very soon and designate a subcommittee to advise and oversee air traffic control services. 
   We create in this amendment a chief operating officer position, and that is very important. There isn't any corporation of any size that doesn't have  that kind of person. You have the person who runs it, the CEO, and you might have the chief financial officer, but you always have a chief operating officer. We don't. The FAA has 55,000 people for whom it is responsible. That is a very large corporation. We believe that, together, the chief operating officer and the ATC Subcommittee will have central responsibility for running and modernizing air traffic control, developing a strategic plan, and implementing it. 
   I personally have enormous respect for the FAA and believe in and trust in the judgment, instincts, and actions of our Administrator, Jane Garvey. I think she is absolutely first class. I have spent a lot of time with her and talked a lot with her. She ran Boston airport. If you run Boston airport, you know what you are doing. She knows what she is doing. She has a strategic way of thinking. She listens a lot. She is around the country visiting people a great deal. We are very lucky to have her. But putting together a budget for air traffic services is very important and calls for a chief operating officer. 
   Having said that, let me say the Administrator will continue to always have the final say and always the accountability for air traffic. This is not a dilution of responsibility; it is simply making an organization more efficient, with no dilution of responsibility for the Administrator. We have to make sure we can attract and maintain the highest caliber leadership in our system. Again, I make the comparison to IBM or Dell Computer, which are very large corporations. 
   Public service does not pay very well. 
   Senator GORTON and I believe it is very important that we have the highest caliber and that we retain the highest caliber leadership in running our system. That means including the possibility of a performance bonus for the chief operating officer and for the FAA Administrator at the discretion of the Secretary of Transportation. That is a very important point. Some people will say: Oh, that is going to be more salary. 
   Again, I remind you that there are 50,000 people, 2 million passengers, and all of these airplanes going all over the country. I have a chart, which I will not hold up because I don't believe in displaying charts on the Senate floor. I never have, and I hope I never do. But if I did, I would show you a chart which is basically the entire United States colored in red. The red is made up of very fine, little red lines, each one representing a flight. At a specific hour of a specific day--if you pick, for example, 5 o'clock in the morning, I am not one who would eagerly seek the opportunity to fly at 5 o'clock in the morning, but there are many Americans who do--if you look even at the west coast, it is colored red. If you look at 8 o'clock in the morning, you might as well forget anything in the country other than the color red. 
   I raise the suspicion that they must have left out West Virginia because we don't have a lot of flights at 5 o'clock or 8 o'clock in West Virginia. The point was made in clear logic that these are planes that are flying over the State of West Virginia and perhaps the State of Maine in the process. 
   In any event, I believe in the idea, when you have a system that is complicated requiring that much technology, requiring that much efficiency, and requiring planning, that you get and you retain the best people possible. That means, in my judgment, and in Senator GORTON's judgment, the possibility of a performance bonus for the chief operating officer and the FAA Administrator. 
   The bill also makes clear that the Administrator should use her full authority to make organizational changes to improve the efficiency of the system and the effectiveness of the agency. That is kind of a bland sentence, but within it is a lot of power. 
   It is a little bit similar to HCFA. I have dealt now with I don't know how many HCFA Administrators. But they all say: Just give me four or five good lieutenants and I will be able to control this agency. They all failed because there are 4,000 health care experts in HCFA who look upon each HCFA Administrator as somebody who is going to be there for 2 years, and they are usually right; and be gone within 2 years, and they are usually right; that they will be there forever, and they are usually right. They know about health care. But they choose not to make decisions rapidly or efficiently. That means the Administrator and the chief operating officer, if we have one, need to have a lot more authority in a sense to shake up the system. 
   Senator GORTON and I would encourage that because we think that efficiency within the system is tremendously important. We set deadlines. We set milestones. We can't tell you right now in this country how much it costs for an airplane to fly from Boston, MA, to Dallas, TX. Ask us that question. Ask the FAA that question. How much does it cost? What is the cost of that flight? Nobody can give you an answer. That is inexcusable. This is one of the things that has to be done. It is one of the 
   things that the FAA desperately wants to be able to do. What does it cost to run the air traffic control system in order to allow that flight to take place? We need to know those answers so we can allocate these costs fairly among users. 
   That is a very important principle. Not all airlines are the same. Not all airlines use the same approaches or have the same number of people or charge the same. There are differences in what they pay. Their obligations to the system, in terms of financial input, have to be based upon what their costs are. Therefore, we need to know what those costs are. 
   With respect to air traffic modernization, the bill calls for a comprehensive review and design of our airspace on a nationwide basis. Are we using it effectively? Are there more creative ways of routing a plane safely? You can do that if you have new technology. They have the technology at Herndon, VA. But do they have it in all of the air traffic control centers across this country? The answer is no, they don't. Until they do, that is going to be hard. 
   But Senator GORTON and I have an obligation to push, to push the Congress and to push the Senate to want to focus on these problems: one, to care about these problems; and, second, to do something about this. 
   We have 29 million miles of national airspace. I don't know how many times that is around the world, but it is a lot. Twenty-nine million miles of airspace is an incredible amount. It is divided into more than 700 individually managed sectors. There are 25,000 of the 50,000 employees that I mentioned who use 575 facilities that run these individually managed sectors. And the air traffic control system manages 55,000 flights and almost 2 million passengers every day. That is an enormous management problem. In fact, it is quite a lot more difficult, I would think, than running Dell Computers or running IBM. Yes, they are international operations. I am talking about their national operations. There is so much more at stake. The life, the safety, the economy, and the convenience of passengers is what is at stake. There is so much more at stake in arranging for the planes to be flown safely and properly. 
   Having said all of this, of course, I add on, as I always should, that the capacity is going to double in the next decade. We are looking at an ever increasing problem. The FAA has already begun to redesign the process. They are not sitting around. They are working hard. They have established a dedicated airspace redesign office. 
   Thanks to Senator LAUTENBERG, they received $3 million last year to get started with the redesign work in the New York airspace. That in itself is a national service because it is far and away the most congested airspace in the Nation. Is $3 million going to do that even for the New York area? No, but again, it is a start. It is not the Big Bang theory. But $3 million is enough to get going. Once you start moving, then people start taking a little bit more notice. 
   We need a nationwide approach to this problem--not just in New York but across the country--rather than doing it on a piecemeal basis, especially since segmented thinking is considered by many, in fact, to be a part of the problem; that we do things by chunks or segments of the country rather than thinking of the country as a whole and how we can best provide a safe air carrier service for people, for packages, for letters, and the rest of it. 
   The amendment we have offered would do all of this. That makes me happy. It makes me feel that it is a very good amendment.  
   We direct the FAA to engage in comprehensive nationwide space redesign. We insist that there be industry and stakeholder input. Stakeholder is not shareholder necessarily. Stakeholder means people who ride on these airplanes. And we give them the resources they need to complete the work in a timely fashion. 
   To realize the full potential of an airspace redesign, we have to have all of the advanced air traffic control equipment in place. Of course, we don't. We are very slow in that today, partly because of the technology development and procurement problems the FAA needs to fix internally. We talk a lot with Jane Garvey about that. She is acutely aware of that and has been working to change that. It is partly because of the vagaries of Congress; that is, the Federal budget process. We are impossible. We have been through so many extensions of a couple of months. It is like we are going out of our way to drive the whole process of this planning and the FAA crazy. 
   That is why Senator GORTON and I are so glad we have these 2 days, hopefully, to even discuss this. A month and a half ago I wouldn't have bet that we would even be able to take this up this year. And we are. 
   That is a gift to the nation, I think. 
   If we can't bring it up, then the FAA obviously cannot make budget changes. We are on our way. Our amendment puts in place what Senator GORTON referred to earlier, a new financing mechanism. This is a creative, good thing in this amendment. It is for more rapid purchase of sought-after air traffic control equipment. The amendment sets up a pilot program to facilitate public-private joint ventures for the purpose of buying air traffic control equipment. It is not for profit. It is the Air Traffic Modernization Association. It is a three-member executive panel representing the FAA, commercial carriers, and primary airports. 
   A lot of airports are very aggressive. I suspect there are several in the State of Maine that want to get going and are being held up. Maybe they have a little bit set aside. Perhaps they want to use some of their passenger service fee. Maybe they want to take 25 cents of that and leverage it into a rather large purchase for some air traffic control equipment which, in their judgment, they need. This allows them to do that. Don't wait for the priority list to come to Bangor, ME, or Charleston, WV. If they have the gumption, they can save up or they can use part of the passenger service fee, say, 25 cents of it, and leverage it and buy modern equipment and jump ahead of the pack. That is what this is about. 
   Obviously, the FAA will continue to oversee that process. This will not be just a creative exercise by a few happy souls. All projects would have to be part of the FAA's capital plan. There is a cap of $50 million in FAA funding per project. That is pretty good. Most won't use that much. Sponsoring airports can use a portion of their passenger facility charge to meet the commitment. I think that will be very important. 
   I am sure the Senator from Washington remembers, I got in great trouble on this side of the aisle. I talked with Jane Garvey, Liddy Dole, and others. They said they spent 25 percent of their time as FAA Administrators working solely on concessionaire problems and negotiation problems at Dulles and National. If that was an exaggeration, give them 5 percent. That is when I broke away from our pack and said set up an independent, quasipublic-private authority and let National and Dulles go to the bond market; they will certainly get triple-A rating. They certainly did. We can see what happened to both airports. Dulles will have to do it all over again because they are so successful. 
   That is what an airport needs to believe they can do. If an airline and its hub airport want new instrument landing equipment, six more precision runway monitors, and aren't on the FAA's list for that equipment or are still years away on the funding schedule, maybe they will decide to get together with the ATM Association on the proposal, the FAA will put up seed money and the airports will do the same. They go to the bond market, get financing for the whole project, and use 25 cents--the PFC charge--to pay for it over 5 or 10 years. That is a great idea. 
   I am excited about this approach as I am sure is obvious. We have only heard positive feedback from all parties--the industry and the airport community. They say, given the change, they are ready to go if we pass the amendment. 
   Finally, the Air Traffic Management Improvement Act also includes authorization up to $100 million to speed up purchases and fielding of modernization equipment and technologies. I am 
   happy to note we have dropped that provision because of the agreement reached with the majority--thank you to the majority--to increase authorization for FAA equipment and facilities by $500 million annually. 
   We are on the move if we pass this. Over time, we will have to spend even more of our Federal dollars on air traffic control and modernization effort. I know we will be considering some ideas for solving FAA's budgetary problems when we go to conference. 
   I--and I suspect I differ with my friend and colleague across the aisle from me--am supportive of Congressman SHUSTER's idea of off-budget. I don't think we can mess around with this situation; it is fraught with danger, and catastrophe is around the corner if we are not willing to spend the money we need to spend. We did it with the highway trust fund. We can put up a firewall, do it off-budget. There are ways to do it. A person can go to some of the air traffic control facilities and see what they are doing, see the stress under which they are working. We have 2 million people in the air, and we want them to be safe. 
   I am glad we are able to make a strong, tangible commitment to the needs of the system. I think these problems are all shared. We all bear some responsibility for them. We all need to step up to the plate to fix them. The FAA does a very commendable job with a very difficult task. They have a terrific safety record to show for it. I don't want to press their luck, ours, or the system's. The system, as it stands now, is not working as well as it could be or as it ought to be. We can't wait to do something about it. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I strongly agree with the words our Democratic leader has offered, and I congratulate him for mobilizing this effort, but it is a mobilization not so much of Democrats as it is of Senators in general. Hospitals and patients and skilled nursing facilities and home health agencies are not Republican or Democrat. The shortages, the closings, the health care denied is not Republican or Democrat. It has to do with the people of our States and of our country. 
   This is a bipartisan matter. I know, without even having talked to but five or six of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, when they went back to their homes during the August recess and when they have been back since, this has been the subject with which we have all been, in a sense, lobbied in the best sense; that is, lobbied by our own constituents, by our own voters, by people who are patients, by people who have had these problems. 
   It is right; we should be fixing this because Congress, in 1997, when we passed the Balanced Budget Act, made changes that were larger in Medicare than any in the history of the program, and we made mistakes. This is actually one of the reasons our colleagues on the other side of the aisle often criticize congressional action because we are trying to play doctor. We often try, but we often do not do it very well. In this case, we did not. We made mistakes. 
   When we make a mistake, we are causing skilled working facilities, home health agencies, and hospitals to close; we are putting in jeopardy margins of profit, which have gone into the red already, of other hospitals, particularly rural hospitals. We have to correct it. 
   There is nothing more self-evident to me than the need for this Congress to take up the BBA corrections and, in fact, do them on a bipartisan basis. We do not have very much time. There  seems to be quite a lot of anxiousness to get out of here. That is not shared by the junior Senator from West Virginia. In that case, it puts more pressure on us to do it. We need a date. We need to do this. This is not makeup stuff. These are real problems. 
   In my State of West Virginia, which is not large but our citizens are no less important than anybody else's, and to me they are more important, in the next 4 years our hospitals are going to face an almost $600 million cut in payment because of mistakes we made in the 1997 Budget Act. They did not make the mistakes. They have not been keeping their books incorrectly. They have not been trying to be inefficient. We made the mistakes. We made the mistakes in Congress, and it is up to us to correct them. 
   Many critical public health services will be cut back. That has happened already. It will continue to happen. Home care agencies in my State expect there will be almost 5,000 less Medicare patients being admitted for their services than before. 
   Eleven home health care providers in West Virginia have closed. That is not a lot, but that is a lot in West Virginia, and it is in a lot of places. We have 55 counties and 1.8 million people. Eleven home health agencies is a lot; 2,500 on a nationwide basis are closed. They are not thinking about closing but have closed because of mistakes we in Congress have made in making these enormous changes to Medicare. They have been forced to close down because the current payment system does not adequately reimburse them for what they have to do. 
   CBO originally estimated home health reimbursement reductions would be $16 billion. It turned out the reduction was $47 billion. That was not the hospitals' fault; That was not the home health agencies' fault; that was our fault. We made that mistake. We have to correct that mistake. 
   The $1,500 cap on therapy is having bad results on nursing home patients with Parkinson's disease, burns, and other things. We need to correct that because we made the mistakes. 
   I will end by saying, I agree on teaching hospitals. We have three teaching hospitals in West Virginia. Whatever happens in general happens in a much worse way in rural States. That is by definition, that is by nature, whether it is hospitals, nursing homes, or anything else. That has always been the case. 
   Rural hospitals have very little to fall back on because they do not have margins. They depend on Medicare more than those in larger and more urban States. These were unintended cuts we made, but we nevertheless made them. The mistake is ours. It is a bipartisan mistake. It came along with a very good bill, the Balanced Budget Act of 1997. Within it, there was some cancer, and the cancer was caused by us, and it is the mistakes we made which are causing havoc all over the health care world. We can change it easily and change it before we leave here, and surely we should. I yield the floor.

   Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, 2 weeks ago I came to the Senate floor to talk with my colleagues in the Congress about the troubled state of our nation's air traffic control system. After a long summer of dramatically increased congestion in the skies and delays on the ground, I implored my colleagues to join me in putting a new and renewed emphasis on aviation, and to commit ourselves to modernizing, reforming, and, if need be, restructuring our air traffic system in order to meet surging travel demands in the new millennium. 
   Today I am pleased to join with Senator GORTON in offering my colleagues a first step in that process by introducing the Air Traffic Management Improvement Act of 1999--a modest but meaningful bill that would improve current management and operation of the system, without prejudging the ongoing and important debate about whether and how to more fundamentally restructure the air traffic over the long term. 
   The Air Traffic Management Improvement Act of 1999 is focused in two key areas--the first being internal FAA management reforms and the second being modernizing of the nuts and bolts of the system itself. 
   With respect to management reforms, this bill would create a new air traffic control oversight committee, as a subcommittee of the FAA's Management Advisory Committee, and a new Chief Operating Officer (COO) position, with central responsibility for running and modernizing air traffic control services, developing and implementing strategic and operational plans, and putting together a budget for air traffic services. For both the COO and the FAA Administrator, the bill would authorize performance bonuses in order to allow us to attract and retain the highest caliber leadership possible for running this essential national system. 
   The bill also makes clear that the Administrator should use her full authority to make organizational changes to improve the efficiency of the system, without compromising the FAA's primary safety mission, and asks the Administrator to report on and provide milestones for the agency's new cost allocation system. 
   With respect to air traffic modernization, the bill calls for a comprehensive review and redesign of our airspace nationwide, based on input from the aviation community, and provides the resources necessary to get the job done in a timely fashion. The bill also includes an emergency authorization of up to $100 million to speed up the purchase and fielding of modernization equipment and technologies that could have made a difference in the gridlock of this past summer but have been held up by inadequate funding. 
   Finally, the bill would set up an innovative pilot program to facilitate public-private joint ventures for the purchase of air traffic control equipment. It would create a not-for-profit Air Traffic Modernization Association with a three-member executive panel representing the FAA, commercial air carriers, and primary airports. Ten projects for modernization equipment would be selected from among applications made by airlines and airports, or a consortium of interested parties, who are willing to share financial responsibility for FAA-approved modernization equipment--and who can't and don't want to wait for the congressional budget process to catch up with air traffic demands. In effect, the Association would leverage a relatively small amount of FAA seed money to more quickly procure and field ATC modernization equipment through leasing and bond arrangements. The pilot program allows for up to $50 million in FAA funding per project, with a total cap of $500 million. It also allows a sponsoring airport to use a portion of a passenger facility charge to meet their commitment and provides incentives for airport participation. 
   In closing, I want to say how thankful I am for the good and sound leadership of my friend and colleague Senator GORTON and of FAA Administrator Garvey and the outstanding FAA employees who work with her and whose expertise, ideas, and technical assistance are reflected in this bill. To my mind the problems of the current system are shared problems--we all bear some responsibility for them and we all need to step up to the plate to do something to fix them. The FAA does a very commendable job with an incomprehensibly difficult task--and they have a terrific safety record to show for it. But the current system isn't working as well as it could or should, and we can't wait to do something about it. 
   My goal in the Air Traffic Management Improvement Act of 1999 is to give the FAA additional tools to get the job done in today's more challenging aviation environment--and to give the Congress and the country some time to consider in a very deliberate and careful way some of the proposals for more far-reaching change. 
   It is our intention to offer this bill as an amendment to the FAA and AIP reauthorization bill, S. 82, when it comes to the Floor in the near future. I look forward to talking more about the details and great potential of these modest reforms at that time. I hope my colleagues will join me in working to improve our air traffic system for the benefit of the traveling public and of the national economy.

   Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I am proud to be a cosponsor of the Graham amendment to restore funding for Title XX, the Social Services Block Grant. This program is critical to the ability of our states to meet the needs of our most vulnerable citizens--children, the elderly and the disabled. 
   The present Senate Labor-HHS-Education appropriations bill contains a provision to cut funding for the Social Services Block Grant by more than half, from $2.38 billion to $1.05 billion. This program has been under attack for years. In 1996, Title XX was cut by 15%. In 1998, the highway bill used cuts in Title XX to pay for the out years of highway spending in 2001. While I understand the importance of roads for economic development, should we pay for it by cutting basic funding for needy children, disabled Americans, or senior citizens? 
   In the last few years this Congress has sent a message to the states. We have said, ``We trust you to know how to take care of your own people. We want to support you, and help you, and at the same time, give you the flexibility to design your own programs.'' This was one of the clear messages of welfare reform. 
   As one of the members on this side of the aisle who voted for the 1996 welfare law, I have to say that I truly believe that these Title XX cuts will weaken welfare efforts in our states. The Social Services Block Grant is used to provide many important support services that help complement the efforts of welfare reform in helping individuals go to work and continue working--education and training services, employment services, transportation, and child care are all among the important programs supported by this block grant. Indeed, as part of the welfare reform package that I agreed to, we promised the states that we would maintain funding for Title XX at the $2.38 billion level until reauthorization in 2002. How can we take back that promise now? 
   You know, one of the greatest features of the Social Services Block Grant is its flexibility. States, and even communities, can determine how to best serve their poor, their elderly, their children and their disabled citizens. My state provides an excellent example of this. While nationally states used an average of 14% of the Title XX block grant for foster care program for abused and neglected children, in West Virginia we use over 30% of our block grant for foster care and 34% for protective services for abused and neglected children. West Virginia cannot afford such a drastic cut in Title XX. It will undermine our State's commitment to abused and neglected children just when tough, new federal time lines are being enforced to move more children from foster care into safe, permanent homes faster. 
   If we cut this funding by more than half, my state will face enormous challenges in its efforts to keep children safe and stable in their homes and communities. This is intolerable. 
   Nationally, 12% of the Title XX block grant is spent on services for the elderly, including protective services for seniors who are victims of abuse and neglect. In West Virginia, 10% of our block grant--a little over $1.6 million--is spent on these services for seniors. This not only provides them with support and protection, it helps them remain in their own homes, rather than being placed in nursing homes or other institutions. 
   What message are we sending to our poor, elderly neighbors, if we cut these services in half? 
   As a former Governor, I understand why Governors want the flexibility of block grants. But the history of Congress is to push for block grants in the name of ``flexibility'' but then to slowly but surely cut the funding of block grants, leaving states and families in the lurch. As a member who cares deeply about poor children, disabled Americans and needy families, I am worried about how such cuts will effect the small communities and our most vulnerable families. 
   We should not cut these vital funds. There is a unique and strong coalition fighting to protect this vital investment ranging from government groups like the National Governors Association and National Association of Counties, to dedicated service providers like Catholic Charities and the United Way. If we believe in community programs and the importance of non-profit charities, how can we justify cuts to Title XX which will hinder their partnership projects? 
   The Social Services Block Grant is not just good for people, it is also good policy. It gives the states flexibility. It helps communities to be innovative in taking care of their own by supporting local partnerships. It makes sense. 
   These funding cuts undermine many of our priorities. We cannot say we want to invest in children and families, then cut the Title XX Social Services Block Grant. This is worse than many of the budget gimmicks in this legislation because cutting Title XX hurts vulnerable families in communities across America. We should not cut this program.

    Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I am proud to draw the attention of Congress and the American people to a very special milestone in the State of West Virginia. Wood County, WV, is celebrating its bicentennial and a two-hundred year history of importance and progress thanks to the continual spirit of its leaders and citizens.  
   Over the past year, through the Wood County Bicentennial Commission, events and activities have taken place to commemorate the county's rich history and install a spirit of excitement about the years to come. People of all ages, throughout the county, have been involved in historic exhibits, contests, and special ways to share the past and prepare for the future. 
   With this statement in the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD, I will make this my submission to the next major event in the bicentennial celebration--the placing of a ``Time Capsule'' at the Wood County Courthouse. With my fellow West Virginians in Wood County, I envision the day one hundred years from the day this capsule will be stored when a future Senator of West Virginia will be presented this piece of history. I am confident that in October of 2099, Wood County will continue to be a center of economic progress, community spirit and commitment, and other features that have defined this corner of the nation for two hundred years already. 
   Wood County has a long history, in particular, in playing a major role in the development of the oil and gas industry in the State and the county. through its resources and industrial progress, Wood County has been the source of fuel for prosperity and growth way beyond its borders. 
   The county is also proud to house a significant chemical industry, manufacturing the critical components of products world-wide and involved in path-breaking research and development. For example, the largest DuPont facility in the corporate structure resides outside of Parkersburg on the land that George Washington once owned. 
   Wood County has tremendous treasures in the form of both its people and its material assets. I join its leadership and citizens in celebrating this bicentennial year, and playing my part in the time Capsule that will reappear another century from now. And I know that All Americans wish Wood County continued prosperity and progress.

    Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, today I would like to recognize a volunteer group of West Virginians who have joined together to educate the public on an important issue affecting our state and the nation. These individuals, who have formed Citizens Against Lawsuit Abuse, CALA, are disseminating information to the public about our civil justice system, and they are working to encourage jury service and personal responsibility in our society. 
   CALA spokespersons based in Huntington, Charleston, Bluefield, Logan, Bridgeport, Fairmont, Morgantown and other cities in our state are educating the public about how lawsuit abuse can affect consumers. The CALA groups in West Virginia have raised funds to provide scholarships to students statewide through essay contests where the students address the important topic of jury service and personal responsibility. 
   Teaching our children the value of civic responsibility is a vitally important component of learning, and CALA's efforts have not gone unnoticed. By emphasizing the virtues of jury service, CALA is helping to give our children a more well-rounded education and is promoting values which will serve these children, and our future, well. I am proud that many of West Virginia's finest students, from our public and private secondary schools, have participated in these essay contests and have been recognized for their efforts in our local media. The winning high school essayists in last year's CALA scholarship contest were Joshua Linville, Sherman High School, Boone County; Amanda Knapp, Pt. Pleasant High School, Mason County; Matthew Walker, St. Joseph Catholic High School, Cabell County; Courtney Ahlborn, Parkersburg South High School, Wood County; Sarah Mauller, East Fairmont High School, Marion County; and Misty Lanham, Tygarts Valley High School, Randolph County. 
   Citizens Against Lawsuit Abuse groups have declared September 19 through 25 to be ``Lawsuit Abuse Awareness Week'' in West Virginia. I commend the citizens for their dedication and commitment and to acknowledge this week as time of public awareness on the various issues affecting civil justice in our state. Our citizens should be encouraged to educate themselves about our civil justice system and how they can help to make it the best in the world.

   Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I have come to the floor to make a simpler amendment. It is an amendment in the number of dollars, $600 million, bringing it up to $1.7 billion, as 51 Senators agreed to earlier in a letter. But I have not been given a copy of the amendment itself. I don't know what the offset is and I don't know, therefore, whether the offsets affect other  programs within this appropriations matter that would be harmful. I ask either the ranking member or the leader if I could have a copy of the amendment so I could simply see what it says. The numbers we agree on, but where is the offset coming from, et cetera?

   Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I would like to make a few comments, if I might, on this legislation. I cannot tell you how happy I am that Senator BOND and Senator MIKULSKI, under the leadership of Senator STEVENS and Senator BYRD, made this adjustment, because I came down here with a 17-page speech ready to raise all kinds of trouble. Now I don't have to because the appropriators have understood very clearly what was wrong with the GAO reform which was asked for. The appropriators at one point asked for a GAO report, and we went and looked at that report very carefully. We tried to find out what we could about it. We discovered the GAO report, which was recommending the $600 million cut, was based upon the question that had been asked: What would happen if the veterans budget was flatlined? So it wasn't. Where are there efficiencies that can be achieved? It was the presumption that there would be the $600 million shortfall, and, assuming that, how would the VA make the cuts? That is different than asking where might there be efficiencies? This was saying, what are you going to do, assuming you get this cut? 
   They came back with this list based upon a flatlined budget. The VA managers, in fact, were told to hit a dollar target. The simple fact is that most of the cuts they suggested would reduce access to care would reduce everything that is useful in the veterans budget. 
   The GAO really had no basis to reach the conclusion they reached. They didn't review any of the items on the list to determine what impact they would have on patient care--not one single item. It is extraordinary. You would assume the GAO is going to do that kind of thing. They simply didn't. They reacted as automatons--having been given the figure they have to cut to, they would go ahead and do it. The cuts would have been absolutely extraordinary. 
   We knew Members wanted to have $1.7 billion added, and 51 Senators, as I indicated, have already gone ahead and proposed this. The GAO with sort of an ax went through what they were going to close: the dialysis unit in Salem, VA; they were going to close all in-patient beds at the Beckley, WV, hospital--something those people there have been living in fear of for years because there have always been rumbles and rumors, and all of that. That was going to happen up until a few moments ago, until the two Senators made this amendment. That was going to happen. All in-patient care at Beckley was going to be closed. That would be something obviously this Senator and others could not go ahead with. 
   Salem, VA, was going to lose its PTSD, along with a lot of other things. 
   There were going to be a lot of abolishments. 
   All psychiatric beds in the entire New Jersey VA health care system were going to be closed. 
   That is beyond my comprehension. If we have to get down to a certain number, we tend to do that kind of thing. This has nothing to do with a national understanding of how to save money when we need $3 billion to make the health care system. The $1.7 billion is what I was going to make my amendment for; it has been made already, and I am happy to join as a cosponsor. 
   I am very grateful this amendment was made by the two people who can do the most with the full committee  chairman answering questions and asserting his insistence on this. I am happy about that. 
   I point out, in closing, it may surprise some to learn that over the last 20 years while VA health care costs have risen 269 percent--which is a lot--the comparable rise for non-VA health care is almost 800 percent. I think that is interesting for my colleagues to think about: a 270-percent increase in the VA health system for health care; in the non-VA health care, an 800-percent increase. That says a lot about efficiencies being practiced within the VA system. 
   I thank the Senator from Missouri and the Senator from Maryland, both stalwarts in their efforts to protect our veterans. I am happy to add my name as a cosponsor, along with a number of others who are going to join in my amendment which I now do not need to make. 
   I yield the floor.

   Second, the head of the health part of the VA, Dr. Thomas Garthwaite, has written a letter in which he says many of the proposals are inconsistent with law and VA policies--that is, the GAO suggestions--and could not be implemented. He said he was personally concerned some would result in a negative impact on quality of care and level of services.

   Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, if I might ask the distinguished senior Senator from New Jersey, are we dealing with two amendments or a sense-of-the-Senate resolution? 
</TEXT>

<DOCNO>106-rockefeller-wv-3-19990915</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Well, a sense-of-the-Senate resolution is preferable in that it doesn't become law and is not binding. It also implies, as I would believe, that perhaps the case for the amendments is not as strong as it once appeared to be. 
   I want to speak vehemently against whatever form this takes, whether it is two amendments or a sense-of-the-Senate resolution. There is no question that the Senator from Oregon is concerned with safety. The Senator from Oregon has the luxury of dealing with flights far better than does the Senator from West Virginia. He has a consistent record on that. I also need to say, however, that when he brought up what was to be two amendments--both of which I disagree with and which I ask my colleagues to vote against, whether in amendment form or resolution form--the Senator didn't give any advanced notice about it. He didn't inform those charged with responsibility for aviation issues on the Commerce Committee before he brought this matter up, for example. 
   Customer service is a problem we have been working on in the Commerce Committee. What I need to point out is that on this very day the airlines are coming out with their plans to implement what Senator MCCAIN, Senator HOLLINGS, Senator GORTON, and the Senator from West Virginia directed and worked with them to do to improve customer service. Today they are coming out with a plan to address precisely the problems the Senator is bringing up. 
   People talk about Washington intervening and Washington trying to do something on its own because Washington always knows best. This is probably a classic case of that--especially on what looks like a tremendously popular consumer issue that can easily get a lot of attention. But we always have to ask the question, is it the right public policy? My reaction in this case is, no, it is the wrong public policy. 
   We sat down with the airlines and we had a very long series of negotiations. We got them to agree to a whole series of things which they are coming out with today, which we haven't actually seen yet, for improving customer service. They are coming out with their detailed service plans on this very day, at the same time that we are voting here on these resolutions. What is interesting is that in the principles we negotiated with the airlines both of the problems contemplated by these resolutions are specifically addressed, and will be elaborated upon in the specific plans of each airline. 
   Now I don't have the advantage of is having the plans before me because they are being announced today. But we pushed the airlines hard and they came back with suggestions; and then we went to them again and said that is not good enough, and they came up with more. We also informed the airlines that we would be working on legislation to direct the Department of Transportation to exercise oversight and monitoring of airlines customer service plans and how they are implemented. 
   We are also working on legislation to increase penalties--if we can ever get to the FAA reauthorization bill, which a lot of people don't talk about--including increases in baggage liability limits, civil penalties for consumer violations, and fines for mistreatment of disabled passengers. We took a very tough approach with the airlines, saying to them, look, we are going to give you this chance because we think you know better than we do how wide a seat ought to be. 
   We think that when it comes to the cost of the fare, or informing passengers of cancellations or delays, you can do a better job for passengers than if we dictated to you how to do it. 
   And at the same time we said to the airlines: If you don't come forth with meaningful service improvements and if you are not effective in implementing these commitments, then we are going to come back at you with legislation. 
   We were very clear in our message to them. Senator MCCAIN, Senator HOLLINGS, Senator ROCKEFELLER, and Senator GORTON--all of us--were very clear about the consequences. We are committed to considering a legislative solution to make the airlines do these things, but first we are going to give them a chance to clean up their own houses. 
   The main difference between these resolutions and our approach is that we don't want to legislate right out of the gate. We may have to end up legislating, if they don't improve things. But let's give them an opportunity first. 
   Consider the case of Southwest Airlines and the question of overbooking. Routinely 35 to 40 percent of the people who make reservations on Southwest don't show up for the flight. Do they have an overbooking procedure on 90 percent of their flights? Yes, they do. They need to do that since on average 35 to 40 percent of their passengers don't show up for each and every flight. 
   On one hand, it seems as if overbooking is an easy thing to do something about. But in practice it is a more complicated question. So, shall we give the industry that knows it has problems a chance, albeit under pressure and restrictions from the Congress and the DOT, but nonetheless a chance to solve their problems themselves? Or shall we simply say we are going to do it for you, and this is how you are going to do it? 
   Again, if they don't come forward, if they don't do this correctly, then we may very well move legislatively. I have said it frequently to them in private and in public that we move to legislate if they don't take this voluntary approach quite seriously, and we will direct and mandate that these customer service improvements be done. But I think to take the heavy-handed approach right out of the box is the wrong way to go. 
   I think it is also ironic, I have to say, that the focus is on overbooking and access to low fares, without giving equal attention to the problems of air traffic control. We aren't paying any attention at all to the underlying problems--the infrastructure problems that are the root cause of many customer complaints, including overcrowding, scheduling problems, cancellations and no-shows. 
   The airlines have until December 15 to get their detailed plans fully implemented. I think we ought to give them the chance. 
   The inspector general of DOT is monitoring and watching each and every airline for any failure to carry out the principles and promises. If they are not effectuated, that will be considered a violation by the DOT. 
   But is there anything really that wrong with giving the people who know how to do it and who will compete with one another to do it best a chance to self-regulate under this very unusual and extraordinary pressure that they find themselves from myself and Senator GORTON? Or do we simply say, no, we know how to do it best, and we are going to do it for you? 
   I hope my colleagues will understand that this a resolution that doesn't do much good for airline passengers. What  will do good by the traveling public is the plan which the airlines are announcing today, and then the oversight and the implementation of those plans, which we will watch very closely and then evaluate how they've done. If they are ineffective in it, then we will move right to legislation. But for heaven's sake, let's not start off that way and pretend we can do all of this better than they can. 
   I yield the floor. I reserve the remainder of my time.

   Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, there is a very famous line that we all know from the heroic astronauts of Apollo 13. The line is: ``Houston, we have a problem.'' 
   Today, many of us who have spent the August recess traveling to our home States and various places across the country also realize that we ``have a problem'' in the air. This problem is not only in Houston, it is in Atlanta, it is in Chicago, it is in Cleveland, it is in Detroit and in nearly every other city across the country. 
   Over the last month, there have been very troubling reports of unprecedented increases in congestion and delays in our national air traffic system--long hours of delay. I have not heard a speech in this Chamber about this in the last several months. We spent most of yesterday having, I guess, basically a political debate about the Puerto Rican clemency situation, but this is urgent in a very different way because it involves life and death, the national economy, and congestion which is beyond the scope of thinking of many of our fellow citizens. 
   We are not talking about merely an inconvenience. We are talking about a potential crippling of the national economy and, if ignored, we are talking about extremely serious safety issues. 
   I happen to be an admirer of FAA Administrator Jane Garvey. I think she is very good, and I think she is tough. She ran an airport in Boston. That is a tough thing to do. I have a lot of confidence and faith in her. She canceled her own summer vacation plans because the crisis was so bad. She stayed in Washington to work with the controllers and with the airlines on this enormous congestion problem on which I will elaborate in a minute. 
   Beginning in mid-July, the FAA and the carriers conducted an on-the-spot evaluation of about 33 different facilities across the country in the air traffic control system. That is the one which routes our planes hither and yon; they better be right. 
   In this evaluation, they came up with a short-term plan for reducing delays and for improving some inconveniences. It is really too soon to say how effective it will be. I am glad they did it, but we cannot draw any final conclusions from it. 
   Everybody involved with the plan seems to agree that these short-term fixes are nothing more than that--short-term fixes. They are meant to address symptoms of an underlying problem which we in Congress consistently fail to address, which is an air traffic control system that must be modernized--but we will not do it, nor put up the money for it--restructuring within the FAA and other areas in order to meet surging travel demands and remain viable, as they say, into the next century. 
   Of course, while this serious problem-solving effort was going on at the FAA and its facilities during this summer, we in the Congress, and especially we in the Senate, have largely or virtually--totally, I should say--stood by. We have watched. We have not even commented. We have simply watched or in some cases even looked the other way. Lack of concern? Too complicated? I do not know. 
   We continue in this same vein that we have approached aviation for more than a year now, ignoring the problem, ignoring the cost, ignoring the solutions, ignoring the complexity, by avoiding the issue and refusing to make the time to debate it in a serious way. 
   We left for the August recess without even bringing up FAA reauthorization or the airport improvement program reauthorization. That is our most basic aviation responsibility. That is our bottom line. We failed to do it. In fact, we all went home knowing that the airport funding program was going to lapse. And, of course, on August 6 it did. 
   Some would have you believe that the FAA reauthorization bill is so mired in controversy that we just cannot do it--not a matter of not wanting to do it; we cannot do it. I am here to tell you--and to implore you--that most of the bill is entirely resolved and that the remaining issues require only some healthy debate, a measure of compromise; and if we will only make the time, we can certainly get all of this done and need to this month.  
   I understand that the majority leader and the Democratic leader have been working very closely on this matter, on doing just exactly that, having us work on it, finding the time to bring the FAA bill to the floor. It used to be that an FAA bill did not have all that much significance. Actually, that is probably not a true statement. Today it has overwhelming complexity and significance to it. 
   Senators HOLLINGS, MCCAIN, GORTON, and I are doing our very level best to work out as many of the remaining issues as we possibly can so the bill will go smoothly and quickly on the floor. And we believe that it can, if given a chance. 
   But the important thing is that we get going, is that we do something, is that we bring it here, is that we discuss it, is that we are educated by it, by some of the facts that surround it because the consequences of inaction are growing very dangerous. 
   Some facts: 
   The Air Transport Association reports that air traffic control delays were up 19 percent from January through July of 1999 and 36 percent from May through June of 1999 as compared to the same periods in 1998. 
   With an average of 1,358 aircraft delayed each day from May through July as a result of something called air traffic control, and an average of 106 passengers per aircraft, the Air Transport Association estimates that 140,000 passengers were delayed in America each day from May through July of this year--140,000 passengers each and every day. 
   For the first 5 months of 1999, as compared to the same period in 1998--a 1-year difference--delays increased at Detroit 267 percent; at Las Vegas, 168 percent; at Chicago Midway, 158 percent; at Cincinnati, 142 percent; at Dallas/Fort Worth, 131 percent. 
   ATA reports that 625 million in passenger minutes of passenger delay each year costs the economy over $4 billion 
   annually and results in passengers being delayed 28,500 hours each day on average--with the numbers going up every month. 
   And 72 percent of the delays are weather-related, they say--it may be true, it may not be--but that does not mean that the weather is so bad that we cannot avoid gridlock on our part. 
   We can, and we must, continue to invest money in training and staffing, in paying for advanced automation tools to enable controllers to work around bad weather and minimize disruption to the extent that, in fact, they would be able to if we were willing to fund them and to give them the possibility of doing that. This technology and this capability exists at this instant and should be improved upon for tomorrow. 
   Before we jump to blame the FAA for all these current problems, I should be very clear that I believe the carriers also share some responsibility, as do we in Congress, again, particularly in the Senate. 
   FAA reports that traffic increases are greatest in the Northeast. That is not a surprise; that is where a lot of people live. And it appears to be the result of several factors: a stronger economy; the influx of regional jets, which fly at the same altitude but not nearly as fast as the big jets, so it complicates the way planes can be maneuvered; significant deliveries of new aircraft to major carriers that have to keep them flying--they have no economic choice to begin to recoup their investment, even if fewer flights would meet their customers' actual needs--the efforts by a couple of the major airlines to develop low-cost/low-fare operations along the eastern seaboard to compete with Southwest on point-to-point routes; and in some cases excessive airline scheduling. 
   For example--and I see my good friend, the senior Senator from New Jersey--only 48 arrivals are possible each hour at Newark Airport in very good weather. But for marketing purposes, individual carriers are scheduling 55 to 60 arrivals at Newark Airport during the exact same hours. This happens at hub airports all across the country and effectively guarantees delay no matter what the FAA, no matter what the controllers might want to do. 
   Allow me to begin to finish with a quote from the latest major study of the system, the broad system, by the National Civil Aviation Review Commission in 1998. The Commission's warning is compelling and has been affirmed by the industry, affirmed by the Department of Transportation, the FAA, the National Transportation Safety Board, and the Gore Commission on Security and Safety, and everybody else who works in or on or with aviation. 
   Their quote:  
   [W]ithout prompt action the United States' aviation system is headed for gridlock shortly after the turn of the century. If this gridlock is allowed to happen, it will result in a deterioration of aviation safety, harm the efficiency and growth of our domestic economy, and hurt our position in the global marketplace. Lives [will] be endangered, the profitability and strength of the aviation sector could disappear, and jobs and business opportunities far beyond aviation could be foregone.  
   So given all of this, I say that we do not just have a problem at Houston but we have a problem all over America. 
   What more do we need to know before we are inspired to act? Must we wait until the gridlock is upon us? Are we waiting for some catastrophic event? Are we waiting to be shot out of our inertia? That is what we have been doing here in the Senate for some time. And does it have to come to unnecessary deaths? Sometimes that happens in America. People don't pay attention until there is something so horrible that they want action. 
   That is not what we want to happen in the Senate. We are given the responsibility for aviation policy--our section of it. We have an authorizing and appropriating process. We have not been exercising it. We have been consistently underfunding the most basic aspects of our aviation system. We know it, we will not change it, and we do not talk about it. 
   We simply cannot continue to sit on our hands, waiting until it is ``convenient'' to start the debate. We are underinvesting in our system to the tune of at least $6 billion each year--$4 billion short on air traffic equipment and technology, an instrument of safety, and $2 billion short on airport infrastructure and capacity improvements. These are just the funds needed to keep us going at the current, entirely unacceptable rate and not to improve our situation but just to keep us where we are. I trust my words have convinced my colleagues that I do not believe that is sufficient. 
   So closing this $6 billion annual funding shortfall doesn't even begin to modernize and do what we need to do in the aviation system. That is a sensitive subject, and $6 billion is a lot of money. We don't like to talk about spending that, but we will get nowhere in aviation without it. 
   Without getting too much into some especially contentious differences between the House and Senate aviation bills, let me state the obvious about this apparent funding gap. We all know there is money in the aviation trust fund that could and should be used. There are any number of ways to do it. We could take the trust fund off budget; we could firewall the revenues; we could simply spend more on the discretionary side for critical and growing needs in our aviation infrastructure. The point is that we have to make a commitment to fix and improve this system, and it is going to take money to do it. We cannot avoid that. 
   So today, I say to colleagues, it is time to talk about the needs of the FAA, time to talk about the needs of the aviation system. We cannot simply go on to conference on a blank bill, and I don't think that is the intention anymore. We can't write the bill in conference. We can't do this without debate or without input from this body. Thankfully, this week I am beginning to feel cautiously optimistic about our ability to work together to get this bill to the floor. Frankly, we owe it to the traveling public and to the tireless air traffic controllers. I don't know how many of you have watched these folks work and looked at the equipment with which they have to work. It is a shocker. In some cases it is stunningly wonderful, and in some cases it is shockingly poor. 
   At some point, underinvestment in something as important as what will carry a billion passengers in 6 or 7 years--our aviation system--will catch up with us. I fear that day is already upon us. The consequences of continued inaction are terribly real--real for public safety and real for our national economy. So let's go forward and take  the work that our majority and minority leaders are now talking about and get 
   to this bill. 
   I thank the Chair and yield the floor. 
   Mr. SHELBY addressed the Chair.

    Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to recognize a great patriot from my wonderful State of West Virginia, Mr. Robert ``Bob'' Ferrell. Bob retired from the U.S. Air Force with more than 21 years of active duty service. He bravely served his country during the Vietnam conflict on the C-130 Spectre Gunship as a gunner and instructor gunner. Over the course of many years of service, the Air Force honored Bob with numerous prestigious awards, including the coveted Distinguished Flying Cross. 
   After completing his tour in Vietnam, Bob returned to his lifelong home of Logan County, and began the hard work of a coal miner to support his family. Bob was an exemplary citizen and participated in many community activities. He was a lifetime member of the American Legion and the Veterans of Foreign Wars. After retiring from the mines in the mid 1980's, Bob traveled all over our State seeking the opportunity to speak to our school children about the importance of service to our country and to our state. 
   A devoted husband and father, Bob raised four wonderful and productive children, two boys and two girls. The example he set for his sons resulted in both of them following in his footsteps and enlisting in the armed forces. The eldest, Mike, is serving in the 101st Airborne division of Fort Campbell, KY, and Steve is a full-time member of the West Virginia Army National Guard. His daughters also are respected members of their communities. The oldest, LaRue, is a chiropractor, and her younger sister, Anitra, is a loving mother and housewife. 
   Bob passed away in May of this year, and was buried, so appropriately, on the day which commemorates the lives of all those who sacrificed so much for our nation, Memorial Day. Mr. President, as you know, I am the ranking member of the Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs, and I take great pride in recognizing this wonderful and patriotic man from my state of West Virginia. Bob was one of more than 200,000 veterans from my home State, and represents the millions of Americans who served our country with pride and distinction. One of the best ways we can honor Bob's memory is to work diligently to ensure that the promises made by our government to all veterans are kept. 
   I would like to close by saying--thank you, Bob. Your outstanding attitude and unselfish lifestyle are an inspiration to the people of our State. You attained the goal all men strive for, in that, you left the world a better place for all of us.

   Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Madam President, as ranking member of the Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs, I am pleased to support this comprehensive bill, which would make valuable changes to a wide range of veterans' benefits and services. 
   The bill we consider today, S. 1076, the Veterans Benefits Act of 1999, addresses many initiatives--from ensuring that the surviving spouses of ex-POW's will be provided for compensated to furnishing job training to homeless veterans. I will mention here only a few of the issues which are of particular interest to me. 
   The first is long-term care for veterans.

   Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I take this opportunity to voice my support for the Arts in general, and specifically for the National Endowment for the Arts. I also want the Senate and my constituents to know that I would have demonstrated this support with my vote if I had not been engaged in an important meeting at the White House while the vote was taking place.  
   This meeting today concerned the future of the steel industry and the Administration's commitment to work with Congress, the industry and labor to ensure that unfair and illegal imports are returned to pre-crisis levels. As my colleagues and constituents know, my commitment to the future stability and viability of our domestic steel industry--which is critical to the economic well-being of West Virginia--is unwavering, and for that reason I felt it necessary to remain at the White House for this important meeting. 
   Unfortunately, the vote on the Smith Amendment was called earlier than anticipated, and I missed the vote. I would have voted against the Smith Amendment if I could have been in the chamber because I believe in funding for the arts, including the National Endowment for the Arts. I take comfort in the fact that the lopsided margin meant that my vote was not necessary to ensure funding for the NEA. I understand that some have challenged NEA's funding decisions in recent years, but I believe the agency has done an admirable job in modifying its policies and decision making process to respond to concerns. Thanks to these efforts, the NEA is a stronger organization. The arts and the NEA contribute greatly to our culture, and it is a valuable investment in my view.

   Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I would like to join Senators FRIST and LIEBERMAN and other distinguished colleagues to commend the Senate for passing the Federal Research Investment Act. This legislation will set a long-term vision for federal funding of research and development programs so that the United States can continue to be the world leader in the research and innovation upon which our high-tech industry is based. 
   One only needs to look as far as the front page of the newspaper to see the effect of high-technology on our country. New drugs are becoming available for fighting cancer; new communication hardware is allowing more people to connect to the Internet; and advances in fuel-cell technology are leading to low-emission, high-efficiency alternative fuel vehicles. According to a 1998 National Science Foundation study, over seventy percent of all patent applications in America cite non-profit or federally funded research as a core component to the innovation being patented. Even at IBM, an industry leader in R&D, only 21 percent of its patent applications were based on company research. People are living longer, with a higher quality of life, in a better economy due to processes, procedures, and equipment which are based on federally funded research. 
   New technologies and products do not appear out of thin air. They are the result of a basis of knowledge which has been built up by researchers supported by federal funding. American companies draw from this knowledge base in developing the high-tech products which you and I read about in the paper and see on our store shelves everyday. 
   I view this knowledge base as an investment. The US government puts in modest amounts of funding in the form of support for scientific research. The dividends come from the economic growth which is produced as this knowledge is turned into actual products by American companies. 
   A large part of the current rosy economic situation is due to these high-tech industries. High-tech companies are responsible for one-third of our economic output and half of our economic growth. Alan Greenspan has said that new technologies are primarily responsible for the nation's phenomenal economic performance, low unemployment, low inflation, high corporate profits and soaring stock prices. If we want continued economic growth, we therefore need to support the fundamental, pre-competitive research critical to these industries, at the necessary levels, and in a stable manner from year to year--and we need to do so now. 
   Just three years ago, federal science funding was in a serious decline and fewer than half a dozen members of Congress gave it any attention. Now the connection between a healthy research enterprise and our nation's strong economic growth is widely understood. In the last two years the science budget has increased above inflation. In particular, for Fiscal Year 1999, an unprecedented 10 percent increase in civilian R&D funding was appropriated. Yet, somehow we appear to be once again in a situation where the future outlook for R&D funding is either declining, stagnating, or barely keeping pace with inflation. We must not only pass the Federal Research Investment Act, but we must continue  our fight to actually implement the R&D budgetary guidelines set forth in this bill. 
   Finally, let me just say that one of the original reasons that I became involved in technology issues, such as the EPSCoR and EPSCoT programs, was because I believe that technology should be shared by everyone, not just those in Silicon Valley or the Route 128 corridor in Massachusetts. Therefore, this bill should be seen as a means of allowing for diversity in our national innovation infrastructure--research must be allowed to flower in Montana, Alaska, West Virginia as well as the traditional centers of science. 
   In conclusion, we have put together a long-term vision for federal R&D funding which we hope will lead to real increases in federal funding for research and development. Federally funded research has been, and will continue to be, a driving power behind our economic success. If we are to maintain and enhance our current economic prosperity we must make sure that research programs are funded at adequate levels in a consistent long-term manner.

   Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a new tool, the ``New Markets Tax Credit,'' to be used to expand economic development opportunities in low-income communities in West Virginia and across this country. I'm very pleased that my good friends, Senator ROBB, SARBANES, KENNEDY, and KERRY, are joining me in this effort. 
   Despite the unprecedented period of expansion of the U.S. economy, many urban and rural areas continue to be held back by stubborn problems such as high unemployment and underemployment, insufficient affordable housing, shortages of services such as day care and shopping centers, and perhaps most importantly, by a chronic shortage of the private investment capital needed to stimulate and support community development. 
   For example, in West Virginia, we have counties where the official unemployment rate is as high as 14%. Counties like Mingo, McDowell, Logan and Boone have seen devastating job losses in the past two decades. For these rural communities, the nation's current economic boom is a distant echo. It's not that these people do not want to work, or that the entrepreneurial spirit is lacking. A major factor is the lack of private sector equity investment for business growth. 
   I have been pursuing economic development opportunities for my state for over 30 years, and perhaps the largest problem I've encountered is the lack of venture capital. America's most depressed economic areas desperately need private investment. They get very little not only because they are unattractive, but also because of misperceptions and market failures. A lack of information, for instance, means that many companies may have an exaggerated idea of the risk of investing in deprived areas, and often have no idea of potential markets. Yes, it is true that private venture capital investment rose 24% in 1998, 76% of the total went to technology-based companies--primarily in California's Silicon Valley and New England's high-tech corridors. But only 5.7% of all venture capital in 1998 went to South Central, Southwest and Northwest regions combined. Obviously, this is a huge disparity that needs to be corrected. 
   The New Markets Tax Credit is designed to encourage $6 billion in private sector equity investment for business growth in low and moderate income rural and urban communities. It would do that by providing tax credits for investments of $1.2 billion annually. The investments would be made by banks, foundations, companies or individuals. These investors would acquire stock or other equity interests in selected community economic development entities whose primary mission is serving distressed communities. Urban and rural communities with high poverty and low median income would be targeted. 
   The tax credits would be issued by the U.S. Department of Treasury to the selected entities. These entities in turn would sell or syndicate the credit to investors. The tax credit ultimately delivered to the investor would be in the amount of 6 percent annually of the amount of the investment, for an approximate aggregate value to the investor of 25 percent of the ``present value'' of the original investment over the 7 years. A ``qualified investment'' by an investor would be a cash purchase of stock or other equity in a selected entity, which must be held for at least 7 years. Substantially all of the investment would be required to be used by the community economic development entity to make ``qualified low-income community investments,'' which would be equity investments in, or loans to, qualified active businesses in the low-income communities. 
   The goal of this tax credit will be to encourage private investors who may have never considered investing in high-risk areas to do so. By investing in the community through local businesses private investors can explore new markets and improve the quality of life for the people in the area. Community development organizations may use the funds from private investors to develop micro-enterprise, manufacturing businesses, commercial facilities, communities facilities, like child care facilities and senior centers and co-operatives. It has the potential to encourage $6 billion in venture capital to these high-risk areas. And because community development vehicles may not redeem the equity interest for at least seven years, capital stays in the community. The New Markets Tax Credit will create new relationships between investors, community development vehicles, and small businesses, which will foster continued support and lasting investment. 
   Mr. President, I believe that the New Markets Tax Credit may be one of the most promising and viable new idea for genuine economic development in distressed urban and rural communities in recent years. President Clinton has highlighted this proposal as part of his FY2000 budget, and just last month took the case to people across the country, those parts of our country which have been too long ignored can experience real benefit from this type of initiative. Communities, businesses, and investors are responding enthusiastically. 
   Hope that is backed up by a strong program of economic investment is needed in West Virginia and urban and rural communities throughout America. We have all heard the talk in the recent weeks as proponents of massive new tax breaks argue that we should send even more money back to those who have benefited the most from our historic economic expansion. I believe it would be irresponsible for us to create ways to provide additional tax relief to those in our society who need the least assistance before we make a concerted effort to revitalize the parts of our country, and to help the people of our country, who have been noticeably left out of the prosperity that went elsewhere. If we're going to do more for those who need it least, let us also commit to do what we can to propel those most in need of a helping hand into the future with real hope of economic success. The New Markets Tax Credit is one solid way to do just that.

   Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Madam President, I urge my colleagues, on both sides of the aisle, to vote for the Harkin-Daschle farm crisis aid amendment. This legislation is the desperately needed response for many thousands of American farmers and their families whose survival is threatened. This is precisely the situation that obligates us to use our authority to enact emergency spending, and to provide enough funding to save our farmers and their livelihoods. This is a crisis that demands the Senate's immediate approval of emergency spending, and the Harkin-Daschle amendment is the step we must take now to respond to a genuine and severe crisis. 
   My plea is for the farmers I represent in West Virginia. Yesterday, the President declared all 55 counties of West Virginia a federal drought disaster area, along with over 30 counties from neighboring states. In West Virginia, the relentless drought has dried up our crops, drained our streams, and brought death to livestock and despair to thousands of farmers suffering these horrendous losses. 
   Yesterday, with the senior Senator of West Virginia and Agricultural Secretary Glickman, I visited the farm of Terry Dunn in Charles Town, West Virginia. We witnessed the tragic effects of the drought on his farm, and sat down with farmers across the state to hear their similar stories. The drought has devastated agricultural production in West Virginia in a way that even old-time farmers have never seen. 
   Because of the desperate situation, Senator BYRD has once again stepped in to ensure that help will be on the way. Through his dogged efforts working with the sponsors of the Harkin-Daschle amendment, there are various sources of funds that will be available for West Virginia's farmers--and, I emphasize this point, funds that will also be available to farmers in similar straits in Kentucky, Ohio, Maryland, Virginia, and Pennsylvania. There is nothing partisan or parochial about voting for this amendment and the drought assistance included. All of us have a responsibility to respond to crises like the one created by the drought. 
   I share the feelings of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle who have risen to extol the virtues of family farmers and rural America. I truly believe that farmers may be the hardest working people--day in, day out, morning, noon and night--in all the land. 
   Now, these farmers are being hurt by acts of nature totally beyond their control. We have a choice to make today that will decide just how willing we are to help our farmers when they are in such dire need. We can decide that we owe it to our farmers to stand with them in this time of severe crisis, and adopt the Harkin-Daschle amendment that will truly address their needs. Or we can settle for the far smaller level of funding provided by the distinguished chairman of the Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee, Senator COCHRAN, that won't be nearly enough help. 
   For anyone who represents a drought-stricken state, there really is no choice. The Harkin-Daschle amendment is the humane and right thing to do. And for anyone who represents states and counties that have received disaster assistance after a tornado or hurricane or sweeping fires have struck, or following a crippling flood, this is the time to extend the same kind of immediate help to a different but very real disaster. 
   We have heard for some time that rural America is in crisis. I doubt that many people in this body think of West Virginia when agriculture and farming are the topic. But in fact, in West Virginia thousands of farmers and their  families labor hard to grow a variety of crops and raise livestock. They are farmers who have rarely asked for help from anyone, but today they are facing the crisis of a lifetime, and they do not want to give up the life and work they love. 
   I am asking my colleagues to vote for the Harkin-Daschle amendment because it will help the West Virginia farmers who have been the victim of two years of historic drought conditions that have ravaged their fields, orchards, and herds. Some of these families have run the same farms since before West Virginia was admitted to the union, and now they are in danger of losing everything. 
   Farmers in my state and many others need the Senate to act and to provide a level of assistance that matches the magnitude of the crisis. We have the means to do that today--in the form of the Harkin-Daschle amendment. We have the authority to do that today--by voting for emergency funding in a time of real crisis. We have the obligation to respond, not along partisan lines and not only if we represent farmers in need--but because a disaster has struck that requires the entire Senate to respond.

   Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I filed a motion to protect veterans' health care because veterans are apt to be hurt by the tax reduction bill before us. I was joined in this effort by Senators MIKULSKI, BRYAN, DASCHLE, HARKIN, and BINGAMAN. Senator MIKULSKI, as vice chair of VA Appropriations Subcommittee, and my other cosponsors all understand what is at stake here. I did not proceed in offering this motion, however, because Senator WELLSTONE offered a similar motion. 
   The issue raised by my amendment still applies to this tax bill. It is very simple: approval of this $800 billion tax reduction bill leaves no ability to meet our obligations to veterans. If we spend all of the federal surplus on tax giveaways, there will be nothing left to fund veterans' health care. 
   In my view, the Senate Finance Committee needed to rethink this tax bill and reserve $8.5 billion over 5 years to appropriately fund VA health care. 
   This is simple math. My motion instructed the Finance Committee to provide for slightly more than 1 percent of the tax cut included in the bill before us. I want to repeat that--it would have set aside about 1 percent of the tax cut included in the bill for veterans. 
   The amount included in the motion--$8.5 billion over 5 years--has been fully justified by the Committee on Veterans' Affairs in its Views and Estimates letter to the Committee on the Budget.

   Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, it is a reasonable amount which covers $853 million in ``automatic'' costs such as inflation and wage increases. It also allows for new initiatives, such as the need to address the dramatic increase in deadly hepatitis C, particularly among veterans who served in Vietnam; emergency care; and the rising long-term care needs of World War II veterans. 
   The Conference Report on the Budget Resolution includes this number. And in an April 30, 1999, letter to the Appropriations Committee, 51 Senators are on record supporting it. 
   Even with the economic prosperity our country has recently begun to experience, if we approve the proposed huge tax cuts, or fail to adjust the budget caps, there simply will not be money left to increase the veterans' health care budget to what it needs to be. 
   I can assure my colleagues that further cuts will seriously jeopardize the quality of VA health care. Earlier this week, I spoke about the erosion of VA's programs to help veterans with special needs. Resource shortfalls have imperiled services for the spinal-cord injured, for blind veterans, for veterans in need of prosthetics, and for veterans in need of mental health care. Health care professionals within VA are overworked. Reductions-in-force have also become a reality for them. 
   In my own state, we are already seeing lapses in the availability of health  care. For example, at the Beckley VA Medical Center, approximately 400 new veterans are waiting to be seen in primary care. Approximately 500 veterans already in the system are on a waiting list for hearing evaluations. And the caseload in pharmacy has increased over 41 percent in the last year, with no increase in staffing, causing many veterans to wait two hours or longer to have a prescription filled. 
   At the Martinsburg VA Medical Center, veterans are waiting six months for a urology appointment. In the PTSD program, the number of beds have increased by 14 while the number of staff have been reduced, making one-on-one counseling very difficult. 
   At the Clarksburg VA Medical Center, current staffing has not kept pace with the demand for inpatient care, and veterans are too often referred to private hospitals because no beds are available at the VA. 
   In outpatient care at Clarksburg, the waiting times for an appointment in optometry and dermatology are approximately four months, and in urology, veterans are waiting seven months for an appointment. 
   There has been a recent proposal to close both the inpatient and outpatient surgical programs at the Huntington VA Medical Center and to refer veterans to a VAMC in Kentucky, over 130 miles away. 
   I can assure my colleagues that if these things are happening in the VA medical centers in my state of West Virginia--and trust me, they are--then you can be sure that they are occurring in the VA medical centers in your states, as well. 
   Staff at each of our VA medical centers have been stretched to the limit, and without additional funding, staffing will only get worse. The erosion of services and the huge reductions in staff have already put the veterans' health care system in serious jeopardy, and I cannot allow it to continue. 
   In summary, there is no doubt that we are at a precipice, and the fate of veterans and their families, as well as millions of other Americans, are threatened by this rush to enact hugely bloated tax giveaways. 
   Mr. President, I am pleased that a majority of the Senate recognized that the size of this tax bill would have jeopardized veterans' health care. As we proceed to conference, I now hope they will come to the same conclusion about other critical domestic programs and rethink this tax cut.

   Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I have several points to make. The other side has talked constantly about we are going to fix the system. We cannot do prescription drugs until we fix the system. It is a question totally of priorities. I will put a little dose of reality into this. 
   No matter what my colleagues on either side of the aisle might think, we are not going to reform Medicare this year on a systemic basis. If it happens the way the majority party wants, it is going to be vetoed by the President. It is not going to happen. 
   The question before the Senate on this amendment is, Do we want to take the tens of millions of Americans who have no prescription drugs and give them the benefit of prescription drugs now through voting for the Kennedy amendment, of which I am proud to be a cosponsor, or do we want to say, oh, let's wait and fix the system, and then when we fix the system, which may be 3, 4, 5, 6 years from now, we will do prescription drugs because that is sort of neat and orderly? 
   The world does not work like that. The real world of the Congress and the White House does not work like that. We are either going to do tax cuts as they want to do it over there, or we are going to do prescription drugs and maybe some modest tax cuts as we want to do it over here. That is the choice that needs to be made. 
   The distinguished chairman of the Finance Committee, Senator ROTH, talked about catastrophic health care. He said beware of that experience. My reaction is the opposite. Remember that experience as the reason not to back off from making a hard choice. That was one of the best bills on health care this Congress ever passed. The Senate did not back off on 
   catastrophic health insurance. Three times they tried to repeal it in the Senate, and 3 times we had 73 votes to defeat repeal because catastrophic health insurance was a good thing for seniors. We did not get the message out to seniors. That was our fault. But do not say beware of catastrophic health insurance. The House backed off. We did not. It was good legislation. 
   We are here to do the right thing. The right thing is to pick between the priorities. Do we want to wait 4, 5, 6, 8 years to fix Medicare until we get a bipartisan consensus? People talk about a bipartisan consensus for Medicare reform. It is not here. They talk about the Breaux-Thomas commission, the Medicare Commission. Everybody talks about the bipartisan thing. It was not bipartisan. 
   There were two Democrats who voted for it, yes, but it was not bipartisan. There is not a bipartisan consensus on the floor of the Senate today of what to do about Medicare, and there will not be one until we have some more iterations which I cannot yet explain because I am unable to. 
   Are we going to stand quietly by while the average senior in West Virginia has a gross income, from all sources, of $10,600 a year, and from which you then are to subtract $2,000, virtually all on prescription drugs or on medical out-of-pocket expenses, leaving that senior with $8,600 a year to live all of life? Are we going to let that person hang until the Senate, in its ultimate wisdom, comes to a sense of what is Medicare reform, and are we going to agree on it? 
   My priority is to do prescription drugs now. Pass the Kennedy amendment. Do it now. They talk about having a $90 billion reserve. The Senator from Tennessee said we have fixed the problem. I am very sorry to say that that reserve talks about ``may be spent for,'' so it might be prescription drugs, it might be disasters, it might be a whole series of things, but there is no Medicare prescription drug benefit that is in their plan. 
   In fact, if I could put it more boldly, under the Republican tax plan, there is no money for Medicare reform. There is no money for prescription drugs. It does not exist. I will hear arguments, and numbers will be thrown back and forth, but that is the fact. It does not exist. That is the reason for the Kennedy amendment--to make us pick a priority: Tax cuts, for the most part for people who do not need them or, in a very small measure, in a very small amount of money, prescription drugs for people who desperately need them, who do 
   not in the form of a cliche but in the form of real life, have to pick each week whether they are going to eat, have heat in their homes, or have prescription drugs. 
   I say to the Presiding Officer, I say to my colleagues, try to live on $8,600 a year, as our seniors do in West Virginia. You could not do it. Prescription drugs are the reason the money gets so scarce for them. We can solve that problem by passing the Kennedy amendment. I think we have an absolute moral obligation to do so. 
   To wait for Medicare reform to be fully formed is a hoax upon those people. They do not know that we do not have a consensus on how to reform Medicare. They do know that they are hurting. They do know that they do not have prescription drugs. And they do know that some of them take up to 12 drugs a day, and they cost, and it is coming out of their pockets. 
   Medicare has no prescription drug benefits. These seniors are not on Medicaid; they are on Medicare. So they have nothing. So the money has to come out of their pocket. That is wrong in America. 
   So the question is the priority. Are we for giving those people prescription drugs--a modest amount of money--or are we for simply going ahead with the $792 billion tax cut and then saying, well, we will just wait until Medicare is reformed someday, and then perhaps we will consider prescription drugs? I think the choice is clear. 
   I thank the Presiding Officer.

   Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 and its impact on providers and beneficiaries' access to health care services. Congress has a responsibility to address problems with the BBA for providers, especially those in rural areas. I believe it is important that we keep one thought in mind during the course of this debate--we debated all these changes to help our seniors. They are, and should remain, at the forefront of these discussions. 
   The BBA made the most significant modifications to Medicare in the history of the program. It signified a change in policy designed to pay more reasonable prices and increase overall efficiency. There is no doubt that these were needed reforms enacted to protect and preserve the program for future generations. However, in light of the magnitude of the changes, we need to make some adjustments to compensate for unforeseen consequences. 
   It is clear that in rural areas like West Virginia, the impact of the BBA on beneficiaries and providers is much more dramatic than in many other parts of the country. Medicare payments make up a larger proportion of rural hospitals' revenues and rural hospitals have lower hospital margins in general. Thus, West Virginia hospitals, like many other rural hospitals, have little to fall back on when federal Medicare payments are cut. 
   Since rural hospitals are often local safety net providers with low, and sometimes negative, margins, payment reductions may mean financial jeopardy for rural hospitals and consequently, reduced access to care for rural beneficiaries. 
   It is not yet clear whether Medicare payment rates will take into account the severity or complexity of patients' illnesses. Under the current law, caring for the chronically ill or those with complex medical conditions can push these health care facilities closer to the brink of bankruptcy. Rural facilities are especially concerned because they do not treat a large enough volume of patents to counterbalance the costs of a few very sick ones. 
   We cannot afford to lose providers without endangering the well-being of our citizens. Therefore, it is imperative that we take action to make sure that the problems we're facing today do not become a crisis that we'll have to face in the near future. 
   I would like to note that this body has voted on one facet of this issue earlier this year. The Senate budget resolution included an amendment, which was passed by voice-vote, that directed attention to the impact of the BBA on hospital care. Specifically, the amendment expressed the sense of the Senate that we should consider the extent to  which the BBA has had adverse effects on access to hospital care and provided additional budget authority to address the unintended consequences. 
   Today, I am offering an amendment with my colleagues from Massachusetts and Maryland, Senators KERRY and MIKULSKI, that takes the next step in providing for the additional needs of our health care delivery system, especially in rural areas. The ``Medicare Quality Assurance and Continued Access'' amendment would amend a small portion of the tax cut for a comprehensive package of assistance to Medicare providers. 
   Mr. President, I am not advocating that we undo the BBA. However, we must address the inequities that resulted from its enactment, particularly when it comes to making certain our seniors get the care they need. 
   We have commitment to those who came before us and sacrificed so much to make this nation what it is today. Today, we have the opportunity to honor that commitment, and I urge my colleagues to do so by supporting changes to the Balanced Budget Act.

   Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I am here in the hopes of convincing my colleagues to oppose the $792 billion tax cut, which is based on a premise of a projected surplus of $996 billion. We have just heard a speech which basically attacked everything President Clinton has done and stayed away from the tax cut debate itself, and that is shaping up as somewhat of a pattern. 
   I am also here in the hopes of convincing my colleagues that the only prudent fiscal course, the only way you can strike a blow for our constituents and for our country and for our place in this world, is by taking advantage of this, what I consider to be almost certainly a once-in-a-lifetime chance to take the projected surplus and use whatever actually accrues from that to pay down the national debt. 
   It is very odd to me that the Republican Party and Democratic Party almost seem to have switched. The Democratic Party appears to be the party of fiscal responsibility. The Republican Party wants to be the party of political expediency. That is a political statement on my part. I apologize for that, but I have to make note of my understanding of what has happened in the last several years. 
   I think we should take this money to take down the debt. I think we should use it to save for Medicare and Social Security's future. I think we should position ourselves to be able, as Alan Greenspan has suggested, if we see the surplus coming in the future years in the way that we want, to then do a meaningful tax cut--once we have put our fiscal house in order. Remember all the talk about getting our fiscal house in order? That is all we talked about in 1990, 1991, 1992, 1993. That was the talk--most of it from the other side. 
   We are almost there. Now we have come to the point where we can actually get over the hump, position America well for the future, and my colleagues, at least some of them, want to blow all of this investment of effort and discipline we have made with a huge tax cut spending spree which the American people are not asking for, nor is American business asking for. 
   First and foremost, let's recognize the $996 billion surplus only exists--and I hope my colleagues will pay attention to this--only exists if you assume that Congress will cut $775 billion in real dollars over the next 10 years from programs that the American people want and need. 
   Does that mean we are adding on new programs? No. That is programs that already exist, that are already under the budget caps and already below expenditure levels of where they ought to be. So that surplus exists only if we cut an additional $775 billion from programs, which I will discuss in a minute. 
   That $775 billion in cuts is itself almost equal to the size of the Republican-proposed tax cut. That should tell you something about the tradeoff here, whether the tax cut numbers really add up. Deep, deep cuts would be required in seniors programs, education, transportation, veterans--just about every area of the Government--an average of over 30 percent if we are to enact a $792 billion tax cut the American people are not asking for. 
   By deep cuts I mean the kinds of cuts in programs that provide health care to veterans. People talk about veterans and then run away from their obligations to them. Or child nutrition--we all talk about children. They will have to be cut by more than 40 percent in real terms if the Republican tax cut is enacted. This assumption is ludicrous. It is ludicrous. It is a sham that a massive tax cut of either $792 billion or, the so-called more moderate approach, the $500 billion--they are both shams. They both have the same results. They both cause us to reverse course on fiscal discipline and responsibility, not just to the American people today but to future generations. 
   We should all have the courage to admit that now, before the Senate makes a mistake of historic proportions, we are subsuming our responsibility to the social fabric of America as we cast our 
   votes. That kind of debilitating discretionary cuts cannot happen in an integrated and united America. The American people will not stand for it. I believe the projected $996 billion will not materialize. That is my personal view. I do not believe it will happen. But the tax cuts will kick in and they will be there. I believe once again we will get into the situation of spiraling deficits that we have tried so hard--going back to the structural impediment talks with Japan, and then the discipline the folks on this side of the aisle exercised in 1993--that all of us have tried to exercise. 
   Fiscal responsibility--corporate America has done it. Now Government is in the process of doing it. We have eliminated the deficits. We have a chance to eliminate the debt, something that has never even been contemplated before. Now we are going to blow it on a Republican tax cut which the people do not ask for. 
   Well-respected economists estimate that there would be probably cumulative deficits of maybe $821 billion in the non-Social Security budget over the next 10 years if the Senate Finance Committee's tax packets were enacted. It is a lot less than what is projected. That should be reason enough to rethink a vote for this tax cut package, or any tax cut package of such gigantic proportions. 
   Let me take a minute or two to outline what I think would happen to our economy if a massive tax cut were enacted. Let us consider what would happen if we actually voted to reduce taxes by $792 billion. Forget the inequity of distribution. I can go into that, but I will not now. Forget the cruel, gross, greedy inequity of that distribution of taxes. 
   No. 1, if you vote for a $500 billion or $792 billion tax cut, which would undoubtedly further stimulate spending, it is inconceivable to me or any rational person in this Chamber that the Federal Reserve would do anything other than raise interest rates. I listened to Alan Greenspan this morning as Republicans tried to pin him into corners, yet he kept coming back to the point that this is not the time to do it. Do not do it now. There will be consequences if you do it now. Do not make the tax cuts now. This is not the time. 
   The Chairman of the Federal Reserve, Alan Greenspan, clearly says that. It is not the time for massive tax cuts. If you credit him, as I think most of us do, with being a part, along with the fundamental force of the private sector, of our booming economy, then you should consider what he has to say. One listens closely to every word he has to say because he has not missed one yet. Greenspan said just this week:  
   The first priority in my judgment should be getting the debt down, letting the surpluses run, and to, as has been suggested here--[I am quoting Greenspan; this is all him]--put in contingency plans so that in the event that all of this is happening, you could move forward later, at a later date, with tax cuts.  
   No. 2, let's examine what an increase of tax reductions would do, let's say, with a 1-percent increase in the interest rates by the Federal Reserve. In West Virginia it would mean the average home mortgage holder with an adjustable rate mortgage of $60,000 would pay $456 more every year for that mortgage. 
   The average student loan payment, based upon $11,800 owed, which is typical, would cost the average student $70 more a year. Add those up, and an average person in West Virginia will have  to pay $615 more per year in increased costs due to higher interest rates. 
   I encourage any Member to do the math for the people they represent. That is the increase they will have to pay. Then you say: But there is a tax reduction out there in the land. In West Virginia, the Republican tax rate reduction proposal will give the average West Virginia family a tax cut of approximately $118 per year versus the $615 more they will have to pay just on college, car, and home. 
   That is a tax cut? If they have to pay more money, that is not a tax cut. But you say: We have the proposed marriage penalty relief. Maybe that is 100 bucks. Maybe that is a little bit more than 100 bucks, but still that is an enormous tax increase on the burden of average families in West Virginia. I am taking the average family median income of $30,500. 
   As far as I figure, it does not add up to the cost of what they will have to pay in higher interest rates that are sure to accompany a huge tax cut. 
   Moreover, many of the people we represent benefit from the programs that will have to be cut. I go back to the 40-percent cut in programs that are now in effect and helping people; not new programs, not new spending, but programs in effect and already underfunded and staying that way through the year 2002. Families with children in Head Start programs will have significant cuts. We all benefit from a range of basic Government services. The air transportation system is grossly underfunded. We all benefit from that. Not all of us, but more and more of the American people are flying. 
   We benefit from what goes on at NIH in biomedical research. Cures for cancer, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and many other things are on their way. Or the assistance that is provided directly to the States--all of these things will be cut under the Republican tax plan. Not just cut, they have already cut, but they will be cut much more. 
   The NIH increase this year is minute. It will go down substantially. Do people really want to do this? Are my colleagues truly willing to sacrifice those benefits for the American people for a tax cut that disproportionately benefits those who are doing best in our country already? 
   Three, the Treasury Department just provided us with an analysis of who benefits from the Republican tax cut when it is fully phased in. I point out on the marriage penalty tax cut, there will be no relief for any West Virginians or anybody from any of our States for the first 5 years because it does not kick in. All we do in West Virginia is pay more taxes under a Republican tax cut because of what it inevitably does through the Federal Reserve System. 
   If my colleagues vote for the Republican tax cut, if they are of such a mind to vote for the Republican tax cut, please understand that Americans in the highest income brackets will get 67 percent of the benefit of this bill. Can anyone call that a middle-income tax cut with a straight face? If one divides up the quintiles--America divided into five different income categories--it is gross, it is embarrassing to see what happens in the distributional tables of who benefits from the Republican tax cut. 
   How much is there for those in the lower brackets doing the best they can? Very little. In fact, for those in the lowest quintile, which is, in fact, close to 23 million families, they get less than one-half of 1 percent of this generous Republican tax cut bill. 
   I suggest my colleagues should be able to answer these questions to themselves before they have to answer them to their constituents. 
   Equally shocking is the fact that more than 45 million families in the lowest brackets get a tiny percentage from this bill. The 23 million American families right in the middle get only 10 percent of the $792 billion Republican proposal. That means, again, that three-fifths, or a little bit more, get only 15.5 percent of the total benefits in this bill. This is wrong; this is dangerous tax policy. Frankly, it is dangerous social policy which will reverberate upon those who vote for it. 
   Fourth, the Republican tax cut will increase mandatory interest payments on the debt by $141 billion over the next ten years. Mandatory interest payments on the debt are already at about $227 billion. Doesn't that tell you in fairly clear and simple terms why we need to, in fact, pay down the debt to get rid of that obligation, to free up for the capital market this money which is now crowding out private sector investments. 
   Five, if we spend every dime and more of our available assets in the form of yet unknown surpluses before we preserve Medicare and Social Security for the future, there will be no additional resources left to strengthen those programs that we know the American people do want, do ask for, do insist on, and do look to us to provide. 
   Medicare is desperately in need of modernization. It is desperately in need of universal outpatient prescription benefits. Social Security needs to meet the needs of the baby boom generation. People on the other side and some on our side talk about we in Washington trying to decide what is good for the people as opposed to the people know what is good for the people. The people out there know. Those whom I represent and my colleagues represent know they are not in it for themselves. They are in it for their children and their grandchildren. It is not just what they think might be best for them. They are thinking, yes, what might be good for them, but what is good for their children and grandchildren. That is the way Americans are. That is the way we have always been. 
   Six, and finally, for your consideration: If my colleagues cast their vote for a $792 billion tax cut predicated on those deep spending cuts, how will my colleagues be viewed in their States?

   Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I thank my Democratic chairman of the Senate Finance Committee. 
   If my colleagues vote for this bill, will they be viewed as a leader? Will they be seen as somebody who is thinking for the long-term good? That is what people want. That is what people yearn for, is leadership. Or will they be looked at as somebody who took the easy course of voting to ``return tax dollars,'' or some part of them? Or will they be viewed as somebody who signed up to an economic plan that will limit our ability to protect Medicare and Social Security? My people point that out. Even if they do not know it, even if they are not sure of it, in their own minds, wouldn't they question whether or not you are exercising leadership responsibilities or political imperatives? 
   When will these devastating cuts in the important domestic programs affect your constituents? Imagine--how would my colleagues respond to that? What would my colleagues say to them? How would they view you when they discover that these things happened and they happened because of a $792 billion vote that you made? What would you hear from your constituents if you agreed to $775 billion in very important discretionary cuts on programs people care about? These are not new programs but programs already reduced, programs to be further diminished by $775 billion. How would they view you then? Would they view you as a leader or as a follower of public opinion that did not exist in that regard? 
   Here is one example which is shocking to me, I say to the senior Senator from New York. The House is now considering reclaiming $6 billion from the welfare reform money from the States--from the States, not even from us, but from the States--to make up their shortfall on the Labor-HHS budget. 
   It is kind of ``reverse Robin Hood''--stealing from the poor to make sure we can provide tax breaks for the wealthiest of Americans. 
   I conclude my remarks simply by urging my colleagues, in the most sincere and intense terms, in one of the most important debates--the most important debate I have been associated with in the 15 years I have been in the Senate--to weigh these considerations against the possibility that exists for this country and for our people if we actually pay down the national debt--to accomplish the impossible--to eliminate the budget deficit, to eliminate the national debt, and then to contemplate what kind of country this could be for all of our citizens.  
   I thank the senior Senator from New York, and I thank our colleagues and yield the floor.

    Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, Once again, I am joining Senator SHELBY and other colleagues to introduce legislation intended to strengthen the manufactured housing industry. Manufactured housing provides a major source of affordable housing for American families, including seniors. This industry represents almost thirty percent of new single-family homes sold in the United States. In my state of West Virginia, manufactured housing represents over 60 percent of new homes. 
   Manufactured housing should play a strong role to increase the availability of affordable housing. This issue will be especially important to seniors who, according to a national survey, forty-five percent of households living in manufactured homes are headed by a person over 50 years old. 
   Manufactured housing is affordable housing, and it is the fastest growing type of housing nationally. The average cost of a new manufactured home without land in 1997 was $38,400, and even with land and installation fees this cost is well below the typical costs of a newly constructed site-built home. 
   But this industry faces challenges. Unlike other housing, manufactured housing is regulated by the 1974 National Manufactured Housing Construction and Safety Standards Act by the Department of Housing and Urban Development, (HUD). Because of reform in HUD management, the federal officials overseeing manufactured housing have declined from 34 staff members at its peak to less than a dozen professional staff now. This decline in staff has occurred at the same time that the industry has grown. Unfortunately, due to a lack of staff, HUD cannot keep pace with the need to update the code on a consistent basis and timely manner. In fact, between 1989 and 1996, a consensus committee made 140 suggestions to HUD about changes for the federal codes on manufactured housing, and 80 of these provisions are still pending in the Department. For example, the 1999 National Electrical Code has new, state-of-the-art standards but given staffing shortage, how long will it take to update the electrical standards? Shouldn't we address the staffing shortage, and get action on the lingering recommendations? 
   In 1990, Congress established a National Commission on Manufactured Housing, and pushed the commission to forge consensus on key issues for this important industry, unfortunately that effort collapsed in 1994. 
   This legislation is a new effort to address the challenges facing the industry. Introduction of the bill is just a first step. We all understand that the legislative process is designed to seek consensus and improve legislation. I believe that we must work hard to forge consensus among the industry and the consumers. This will be a challenge, but the potential rewards can be great for both sides. The industry can win and prosper with a more effective, streamlined regulatory process that keeps pace with improvements and standards. Consumers will win if safety standards and regulations are adopted more efficiently. Also, if the industry uses new standards to provide better housing, manufactured housing could be designed to meet a wider variety of needs including modules for assisted living. 
   The current system of regulations and oversight is not working for the industry, nor is it working as well as it should for consumers, according to a survey by seniors. But when there are problems and concerns, all groups need to work together on a strategy for change. 
   This legislation is intended to promote reform that will help both the industry and the consumers of manufactured housing. My hope is that all sides will work together to forge consensus about reform. 
   We should use this as an opportunity to come together and develop a new, improved strategy for manufactured housing. Affordable housing is a major issue for families and communities. Manufactured housing is playing a key role in affordable housing, but more could and should be done. To achieve success, we need to develop a bipartisan, consensus approach. We need to help the industry and assure consumers that safety and standards will be retained and improved, not weakened. This is worth our combined effort to provide more affordable housing.

   Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I am very anxious to talk to my colleagues. I want to do it as much as I can in these days to come. 
   As the previous speaker said, with whom I do not agree on policy, this is a momentous, once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. 
   I have been here for 15 years. I was for 8 years before Governor of West Virginia where we faced things such as 21-percent unemployment, and things which are almost Third World in their statistical significance compared to what most of my colleagues had to deal with. 
   Being able to look at a tax surplus or a projected surplus of a lot of money over the next number of years is a wonderful opportunity for the people of my State and for the people of my country. 
   I have to say, though, the approach of the Finance Committee, on which I serve, voting a $792 billion tax cut is antithetical, to my thoughts, as to what is good for the country and good for the economy. 
   I will start off by simply saying the obvious; that is, as one of the senior Members of the majority side of the Finance Committee said, 5 percent of Americans pay 95 percent of personal income taxes, and therefore the money ought to go back to them. That is an odd way of thinking. That is certainly one way of thinking. It is obviously that Senator's way of thinking. It doesn't square with sort of the sense of fairness, equity, and distribution of equal opportunity in an economic sense as in other senses that I was brought up to believe in. 
   We have projected--and I underscore the word ``projected''--a surplus of $1 trillion over the next 10 years. The central question is: How do we most responsibly spend this? I think it is a central question of historic importance. 
   For me there is really only one answer; that is, to pay down the national debt.  
   It is very hard for me to put into words the feeling of how far we have come since the mid-1980s when we used to have those talks with the Japanese, the structural impediment talks in which they would tell us what they thought we should do and we would tell them what we thought they should do and we never listened to each other. We, in fact, listened to them in 1993, and on our own, in a historic vote, made an enormous beginning, later fueled by the private sector, to balance the budget deficit. I didn't think that would happen when I was in the Senate. But we proceeded to take the action. 
   I myself was assigned the responsibility of cutting $60 billion out of Medicare, which at that time was a great deal of money, and we proceeded to do that. But never in my wildest dreams did I ever even begin to think of the possibility that we might, in fact, be able to pay down the national debt--the national debt which under the Reagan-Bush administration rose to over $4 trillion. I can't contemplate amounts of that sort. So I couldn't possibly contemplate the results of eliminating amounts of that sort. 
   But we have a chance to do that. We have the chance to do it by the year 2014 and 2015. 
   People talk a lot about taxes around here. To me, the greatest tax will come if we pass the Republican tax package, if we ``give'' the so-called ``middle-income worker'' that kind of tax advantage because I think it is false. In my State, where the average income is around $30,500, I think the average mainstream 
   worker would end up losing $500 or $600 a year because interest rates would go up on car payments, on home loans, on education loans, on credit cards, and all of those things. Interest rates would go up because we know from what Greenspan said they would. They would probably go up by about 1 percent. 
   I think the average people in the State whom I represent would end up paying much more under the Republican tax cut plan than they would if we opted to retire the debt because in that case, I think interest payments would go down, and those same people--having watched in wonderment what is or is not going on in Washington--would benefit from the results of two things: Not only lower interest rates, which would affect them up to where they are fixed, but they would also benefit from an economy. 
   I try to contemplate this in my mind. Come the year 2010 or 2011 when the world really begins to understand that America is dead tracked on the idea of elimination of the national debt, what would happen to the national economy? 
   My mind can't even bring that into consideration, except it is filled with scenes of incredible entrepreneurial activities by people who are willing to take risks, people who emerge from the hollows of West Virginia, from the deserts of Nevada, from all kinds of high plains of the Northwest, or the northern middle west, and start doing all kinds of things which they have never dared do before base interest rates were there to do it, where money is available, capital is available, and there is a sense of optimism in America, and what I have seen in the last 8 years becomes almost a memory in terms of the optimism and the incredible success and energy of that kind of new economy. 
   To me, paying off the national debt does two things: 
   One, it guarantees the economic future of the people whom I represent, who elect me to represent them; and it guarantees the economic future of the entire country for perhaps a generation or two to come because we will have done something impossible--eliminate the budget deficit, and then eliminate the national debt. 
   How would the markets respond to that? How would human nature respond to that? I only glory to contemplate what that might mean. 
   Second, I want to pay down the national debt because I don't want to spend money. I don't want to spend money on a whole lot of new things. I want to make sure that something called Social Security--the money for that--and something called Medicare --the money for that--is there in the meantime, until those programs run out of money in a number of years, as all of that money will be going into those trust funds, building up and guaranteeing the future of Medicare and Social Security. 
   That is a matter not of the energy of the American economy but the depth of the American commitment, the social contract that we made both with respect to Social Security and Medicare, both of which are going to need our attention and which need more funds. They would have the funds under a system wherein one concentrated on paying down the national debt. 
   In the Finance Committee, I originally was for a tax cut of only $250 billion. I am for that today. That was a different tax cut from anything we are considering. I worry very much about Americans not saving. I like the idea of Government matching any American who put a certain amount of money into a savings account; in other words, to encourage something which we do worse than any other people in the world, and that is to save money, putting money in the bank--not only for one's own future but for the capital markets. 
   I want to see that. I want to see the marriage penalty tax eliminated so it does not become more expensive to get married, it becomes less expensive to get married. If we put up a bill that had no tax cut at all, I would be tempted. I don't know, in the final analysis, if I would vote for it, but I would be tempted. 
   I believe in paying off the national debt. I think the consequences of that are enormously exciting. Not contemplating the numerical ``joust'' we play with each other over millions and trillions of dollars, the simple fact is that by the year 2014 or 2015 there would be virtually no national debt remaining--less than 1 percent. That is the single most exciting public policy event I can contemplate since I have served in the Senate. My fear is that Congress is going to figure this out but that Congress is going to figure it out too late, after it has already done the damage. 
   I regret our failure so far to seize this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to pay off the national debt. I regret it for my State. My State is the oldest State, so to speak, in terms of population. It has actually surpassed Florida. That would naturally bias me in terms of Social Security and Medicare. If I were from another State, I would feel the same way, I believe. 
   Social Security has lifted two-thirds of Americans out of poverty. Does one turn one's back on this? People voted for the $792 billion tax cut. But $2 trillion of the surplus already belongs to Social Security. That is not on the table. Of the $1 trillion remaining, that can only happen if we do draconian domestic cuts. I don't mean adding new programs. I mean taking tremendous numbers of billions of dollars in every single area for years and years and taking away from what we are already doing. 
   I care passionately about veterans' health care as I have watched the veterans' health care system deteriorate in a variety of ways across this country. We are not talking about increasing veterans' health care costs. We are talking about tremendous cuts in those we already have. 
   Many Members have discussed the fact that a young mind is formed by the time it is 3 years old, the importance of Head Start, the importance of the Older Americans Act, the importance of low-income-housing heating, housing, enterprise zones, law enforcement, the military. All of these receive enormous budget reductions that would sustain themselves over a number of years. Over half a trillion cut from present spending in fiscal year 1999; the same on through fiscal year 2002 and beyond that. 
   CBO doesn't even choose to figure what happens after 5 years. They say they have never done it before so why should they do it now. I think that is an amazing way of thinking. That is what they say. 
   If we spend $792 billion on a bunch of tax breaks now before we even know that the money is for real and that it will absolutely be there, I cannot in conscience, for the people I represent, believe that Medicare and Social Security will be anything under the great strain of reducing benefits. I cannot bear to have that happen. I don't think anybody should tell you otherwise. 
   I understand it is very easy to talk about a $792 billion tax cut. It is wonderful to sit in the Finance Committee and have people say we ought to do  this or that about ethanol and this or that regarding helping different people, different groups. Sometimes people voting for the bill got all kinds of things implanted in the bill. That was nice. I am sure they were good things. 
   How does that compare to the real possibility of setting America virtually free economically, establishing our economic dominance for all time by retiring the national debt? Think how the markets would respond to that. Think how capital overseas would flow into our markets, further enabling us to go out and build an even stronger America, close the digital divide, to give everybody an equal opportunity--not guaranteeing that everybody succeeds but guaranteeing everybody has at least a chance to succeed. 
   I cannot allow NIH, Head Start, or education programs to take the tremendous reductions from their current level of funding by the Federal Government that would be required under the Republican tax cut. It is phenomenal to me that people have not focused on this consequence of that $792 billion tax cut, a tax cut basically for the rich who already have it, who have already gained by the system, who have already gained through the last 8 years by the stock market increase. 
   What about the people who are working hard and who would receive a $188 tax increase compared to a $700 or $800 tax increase for people who are very wealthy? I ask my colleagues to think about fairness. I ask my colleagues to think about the consequences of a $792 billion tax cut, and I ask my colleagues above all and finally to think about the absolutely extraordinary power of what would happen in this country if we actually reduced the national deficit to virtually zero--deficit and then debt. We can do both. Therefore, we shouldn't do the Republican tax cut. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I have one quick point. People say we ought to have a tax cut and we ought to give it back to the people who earned it. In other words, it is not the Government's money; it is their money. 
   I think one thing is interesting: How much is it their money as opposed to their children's money and their children's children's money. In other words, when we talk about protecting money for future programs, such as Social Security and Medicare, we are not just talking about those who pay taxes, whether they be rich or poor, but whether or not their children and their children's children are going to have a reasonable shot at life. It is not just that we do not have money because we are living now and others are not, but we have to keep looking toward the future and our responsibility to that future; is that not right?

   Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I had not expected to talk this afternoon. But I am here. The Senator from West Virginia is here. I am the ranking Democrat on the Veterans' Committee. I am overwhelmed with the sense of urgency, and almost despair, about the condition of health care for veterans in our country. 
   Because of caps, the veterans health care budget, which is really the most important part of the veterans operation--benefits are important but what they really care about is, is health care going to be there if they need it?--has been flat-lined for the next 5 years. By flat-lined, I mean there is no increase. Even though there are more expenses, there is more requirement for their services, there is no more money. 
   The Veterans' Administration is the largest health care system in the country. The only difference from any other health care system is that it is entirely a Government health care system. Therefore, the Government determines what it can spend and what it cannot spend. Unlike the private health care systems, it cannot spend a dime over what it is appropriated. So the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, which capped all discretionary programs--which said they could not increase--obviously, therefore, included the veterans health care budget. 
   I cannot tell you the damage that is being done to our veterans across this country. We talk about veterans, and we talk about them in very florid terms because they deserve that. Those who use the veterans hospitals, who have been in combat, who have sacrificed for their country--America kind of entered into a compact and said that these people will be treated with a special respect, special honor, and special care, and that they will get the health care they need under all conditions and at any time. 
   The Republican tax cut, along with any other that might be suggested, including the one that is being talked about at $500 billion, would make a mockery of that commitment to the American veteran. I want people to understand that very clearly. 
   I will talk specifically about some particular types of needs, such as spinal cord injuries, injuries resulting in blindness or amputations, posttraumatic stress disorder. Beginning in October of last year, I asked my committee staff to undertake an oversight project to determine if the Veterans' 
   Administration is, in fact, maintaining their ability to care for veterans with these kinds of special needs. 
   PTSD, posttraumatic stress disorder, we always associated with the Vietnam war. We have discovered it is not just that war; it is the gulf war, it is the Korean war, it is the Second World War, and it even goes back to the First World War. It is an enormous problem and a special need. 
   This oversight project, which I asked my staff to do, reviewed 57 specialized programs housed in 22 places around the country. 
   I say at the outset that the VA specialized services are staffed with incredibly dedicated workers, people who could be working for higher pay in private situations, private hospitals. They are trying to do more, and they are trying to do it with increasingly less. They are often frustrated in their desire to provide the high-quality services that they went to the Veterans' Administration to provide in the first place. I salute them. 
   I will mention three of the findings in this oversight effort, and then that is all I will do. 
   First, the Veterans' Administration is not maintaining capacity in a number of specialized programs and is barely maintaining capacity in a number of others. Despite resource money shortfalls, field personnel have been able--but just barely--to maintain the level of services in Veterans' Administration prosthetics, blind rehabilitation, and spinal cord injury programs. 
   Staffing and funding reductions have been replete. The VA's mental health programs are no longer strong. For example, my staff found that veterans are waiting an average of 5 and a half months to enter posttraumatic stress disorder programs. This is completely unacceptable for a veteran. 
   Secondly, the VA is not providing the same level of services in all of its facilities. There is wide variation. Staff found this variation from site to site in capacity in how services are provided. The availability of services to veterans seems to depend on where they reside, 
   not what they have done but where they reside. In my view, all veterans are entitled to the same quality of service regardless of whether they live in West Chester County or in Berkeley, WV. It should make no difference. They all have suffered the rigors of combat. They have all earned it. We promised it to them. We are not delivering it to them. 
   Third, and finally, competing pressures on Veterans' Administration managers make it virtually impossible for them to maintain their specialized medical program. Hospital administrators particularly are being buffeted by competing demands because from central headquarters comes the lack of money, from the veterans comes the demand for services, which used to be there and which now aren't, and they are, therefore, caught in the middle. In many cases, they are suffering across-the-board cuts and have been for a number of years. 
   I can tell Senators that under neither Democratic nor Republican administrations has the veterans' health care program been adequately funded and funded up to the cost-of-living increase and the so-called inflationary aspect, which reflects what actually true health care represents. We are robbing Peter to pay Paul in many of our veterans' hospitals and to maintain other services on which a higher priority is placed. 
   Mental health services, I come back to it. Why is it in this country that we will not put down mental health as a disease? Why is it we do not consider it as a medical condition? Why is it that we put it off in the category of human behavior as opposed to something that has a cause in something, such as posttraumatic stress disorder. For veterans, to blindside mental health, to push mental health to the side is beyond comprehension and beyond humanity. 
   In summary, it is imperative that we all understand what the budget crunch has meant to each VA health service. I say all of this because, again, of the $792 billion tax cut. If that takes place, everything I have talked about not only continues to be true but grows somewhere between 15 and 30 percent worse, not if we are to increase programs, but taking already that we are funding below where programs ought to be, where we have shortchanged veterans' health care services for years, and now we are going to cut billions and billions of more dollars out of that over these next years. That is absolutely intolerable. 
   I ask unanimous consent to print a copy of the summary of the committee minority staff report in the RECORD at this point.

   Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I thank the Presiding Officer, as well as I thank my esteemed friend from Nevada. 
   Mr. President, I came a bit earlier than was anticipated. I look forward to expressing what are some strongly held views on my part. 
   In a formal sense, I rise today to object to the reinstatement of Senate rule XVI. That is my purpose in being here. Up until 1995, it prohibited legislating on appropriations bills. That is the reason I formally rise. 
   The Republican majority, in fact, is responsible for overturning the rule which was designed to keep legislative matters unrelated to appropriations bills from bogging down the appropriations process. The Republicans themselves were responsible for overturning the longstanding Senate precedent by rejecting the ruling of the Chair, something that was given little notice and was little commented upon but is now of increasing monumental proportions. 
   I cannot support returning to the previous order because I respect the Senate. It seems to me anybody who has a sense of what the Senate was designed for and what the Senate is, what the Senate should be, what the American people expect the Senate to be, will vote as I will vote because to do otherwise is to diminish this body, which I think has been diminished substantially in the last 5 or 6 years in any event, in terms of its impact on American debate, its impact on discussion, its impact on the intellectual activity of the Senate, and, in fact, its impact on American society as a whole. 
   I happen to represent steelworkers, farmers, airport managers, veterans, rural people, patients, doctors, nurses, just as the Presiding Officer does. This Senator may have a 
   few more steelworkers in his State than the Senator from Kansas does in his State; otherwise, we represent more or less the same people. I do not think these people ought to have their business pushed aside, their concerns, their worries, what they care about pushed aside in order to make the Senate's bill or the Senate's way of working more manageable, more efficient, more to the liking of the leadership, more House-like, more limiting, less substantial, less interesting, less of scope, less of dignity, less of the power of the tradition of the Senate.

   Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I believe the majority is interested in controlling debate. I have wanted to say this a long time, and I have not found the place to do it properly, but I find so today. I believe the majority--not the Presiding Officer who has changed since I began my remarks, who is an entirely different kind of person--the people who run the majority, who speak for the majority, who lead the Senate on behalf of the majority, are interested in controlling debate, minimizing debate in making the Senate more like the House from whence they came and in trivializing the Senate. Those are harsh words, but they come from a disturbed and unhappy Senator--not disturbed in a psychological sense, I point out to the Presiding Officer, but disturbed in the sense of not feeling good about the work I am able to do as opposed to the way it used to be a number of years ago when I first came to the Senate. 
   I wish I could tell my colleagues I believe the Senate is functioning in a way that means legislative business can occur on authorizing legislation, but I cannot. I wish the Senate would return to a more efficient appropriations process that does not deal with extraneous legislative matters, but under the Senate's current leadership, Members of the majority party have effectively gagged--there is no other word for it--the minority from raising policy matters on the Senate floor. 
   Every Tuesday, members of both parties have caucuses. Those caucuses, in the case of the Democrats, used to deal broadly with issues and with functions and divisions of responsibility and debate within the caucus. 
   Now, for the most part, they are taken up with, how can we make ourselves heard? How is it that we can, by some manipulation or clever method, try to work our way through a loophole which allows us to bring up an amendment, to speak on behalf of our constituencies? 
   In every single caucus there is a question of how the majority is diminishing the minority, not in a way which would just be satisfying in the sense of a Republican making a Democrat feel less important or making a Democrat's role less important in the Senate, but in the sense of diminishing honest and open and real debate. 
   That is what I came to the Senate for in 1985--honest and real debate. I did not expect to win everything. I did not expect to lose everything. But I did expect to be able to debate, to be able to make my views known, as one can in a committee. All committees are run relatively fairly. The Finance Committee, the Commerce Committee, which I sit on, are run fairly by their majority leadership. This place is not; the floor of the Senate is not. We are gagged, as in the Patients' Bill of Rights doctors were gagged. We are not allowed to express our views. 
   I resent that enormously, I say to the Presiding Officer. It takes a lot away from being a Senator. I know no longer the greatness of the difference between being a Member of the House and being a Member of the Senate. There is, of course, a difference. I stand here and speak, and I speak as I choose to speak, and nobody is stopping me, but that is because we have this arrangement for this day. For most of the rest of the time, morning business has been closed off--or had been--quorum calls were not honored, to be able to interrupt them, as this one was honored. It is a different body. It is a distressing situation. All of us, on both sides, all 100 of us, are diminished by the way this Senate is run. 
   Let me give an example of a piece of legislation, and it is not even the first one on the minds of most, but it is a big one in terms of this Senator: This legislative body's failure with respect to the FAA and the airport improvement reauthorization bill, which is, for the fourth time in less than a year, on the brink of expiring. 
   Last fall we threw a 6-month extension into the omnibus appropriations bill. When that expired on March 31, we did a 2-month extension--embarrassing--until May 31; then a 65-day extension--embarrassing--through August 6. And now we are close to August 6, and we may have to--and probably will--have to do yet another extension. All of these short-term extensions may make us feel better temporarily, but they are not solutions. They do not obviate the need to take up and debate and pass an authorization bill. 
   But we cannot debate it. We cannot debate anything on this floor except what it is the majority wants to debate. Then they fill up every tree, preclude every amendment, and we are all diminished, and the public process is diminished at the same time. 
   So in the current Senate environment, which I deplore, regret--I like the people who lead the Senate on the majority side, but I do not respect the way they lead this Senate. I think all of us suffer from the way they lead this Senate; that is, to make the Senate more like the House--puppets. 
   So in this current Senate environment, I am not willing to give up a single avenue for getting my work done. I will not support giving the majority one more way to cut off debate on important policy issues--such as aviation or the future of our Nation's steel industry, restoring money to Medicare providers who have been too deeply cut. We hear more about this than any other subject when we go home. Have we discussed it? No. Research and development, lots and lots of other things. 
   So the arcane rules of the Senate may not be at the forefront of the concerns of everyday Americans, but the rules of this Senate guide the way our democracy works or fails to work. They guide the way the people trust their Government, and they also guide the way people within the Government trust the Government within the framework of which they work as best as they can. 
   The legislative process is honorable. It is time honored. I fear that we are  dangerously close to the Senate losing its reputation and role as a great deliberative body.

   Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I thank the Presiding Officer. 
   I point out to my friend from New Hampshire that he did, indeed, have the floor. The parliamentary process seems to be working. 
   He has mentioned those aspects on which he disagrees with China five or six times apiece now since I have been on the floor in only the last 10 minutes. I don't think he should be that concerned about not being able to debate. 
   There were those of us on the other side of the aisle who were trying to debate something called the Patients' Bill of Rights for several weeks, and we were denied that. Well, this is a tough body. One does the best they can. 
   I think terminating normal trade relations with China would be an enormous mistake. I have often said one of the greatest speeches I have ever heard on the floor was given by Senator Jack Danforth. It was the last one he ever gave on the floor. It was a number of years ago when he retired. He talked about the fact that every Senator wants to be a Secretary of State, and every Senator thinks that he or she is a Secretary of State. Every Senator thinks that he or she ought to act as Secretary of State, and that about half of us try to. There is an endless opportunity because you can bring up other countries and bring up all the things you don't like about them. 
   The Senator from New Hampshire doesn't approve of different of their social policies, so he brings them up. He has a chance to speak about them. None of this, in my judgment, has to do with the self-interest of the United States of America. What is foreign policy? What is trade policy? It is meant to be the self-interest of the United States of America. 
   The Senator, as he concluded his argument, actually said that China was taking over, implying that they had taken over the Panama Canal. That came as a surprise to me because I read the news fairly diligently and haven't heard that. What I do know is this: China has been through 5,000 years of history, and I have studied it quite carefully. They have never had a single day of stability that they could count on. In fact, even under Confucian philosophy, the people always have, in the so-called five relationships, the right to overthrow the emperor any time they want, and they frequently have. 
   They are, as the Senator from Washington indicated, one-fifth of the world's population. They are an absolute key. The very worst thing I can imagine us doing at this time would be to terminate normal trade relations. 
   If the Senator from New Hampshire, as he says, believes that the Chinese are not treating the Taiwanese well, if you want the Taiwanese-Chinese relationship, the PRC-Taiwanese relationship, it is not a zero-sum game. The best relationship between the PRC and Taiwan is always going to be under those conditions wherein the United States and the PRC have the most normal, natural, and efficient relationship. That means we will disagree on many things, but we will also do a number of things, which we have been doing for years: For example, trading, exchanging students, learning more about each other. Americans have always had a kind of love/hate relationship with China. It is part of the mysticism, the mystery of our intangible history of the past centuries with them. 
   We have never really understood China very well. We don't understand China very well today. But one thing I know, if we terminate normal trade relations, it is going to give the upper hand to the very people in the People's Liberation Army, some of the younger turks there who are the people that, in fact, in 1996 led the move to point missiles at Taiwan and who are probably right now doing everything they can to destabilize Zhu Rhongi and President Jiang Xemin, who are trying to reform China, to stabilize China, to deregulate China, to make China into a more modern economy with, all the time, 120 or 140 million people that are completely homeless wandering around the country. 
   I strongly advise my colleagues to vote against what is quite an outrageous resolution, which has no place whatsoever on the floor. 
   I yield the floor.

    Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I ask that we take a moment today to recognize the enlisted men and women of the West Virginia Air National Guard. Earlier this year, Major General Paul A. Weaver, Jr., the director of the Air National Guard, declared 1999, ``The Year of the Enlisted Force'' in an effort to promote enlisted pride. In a March 18th proclamation, Governor Cecil H. Underwood, Governor of the great State of West Virginia, made this designation effective. 
   The Air National Guard is made up of about 95,000 people, nearly 88 percent of whom comprise the enlisted corps. About 65,000 are traditional part-time members and about 30,000 are either full-time technicians or members of the Active Guard. They average about 12.7 years of satisfactory service and perform 170 different specialty jobs. These enlisted men and women are America's friends, family, neighbors, and co-workers. They are educators, bank tellers, repair technicians, and builders. At the same time, they serve  our nation as the enlisted force of the Air National Guard and they bring their diverse skills to the job. The enlisted men and women bring maturity and experience to the force and provide a much needed sense of stability and commitment. 
   There are two units of the Air National Guard in West Virginia. The 130th Airlift Wing in Charleston, West Virginia, and the 167th Airlift Wing in Martinsburg, West Virginia. These two units supported missions during the Korean conflict and in Vietnam. Both units were stationed in the Persian Gulf throughout the Gulf War. Recently these brave men and women have performed peacekeeping missions in support of the United Nations and NATO in Eastern Europe. In fact, many of them are there as we speak. 
   The men and women of the West Virginia Air National Guard have won many awards. Some of the most prestigious include Air National Guard Distinguished Flying Unit Awards, four Air Force Outstanding Unit Awards, and four Spaatz trophies. It is important that we all take note of the accomplishments of these outstanding enlisted men and women who make up the backbone of the Air National Guard. They bring an incredible amount of dedication to their work as they perform jobs which are crucial to military operations. They deserve our deepest gratitude as they continue to serve our country. 
   My sincere congratulations go to the enlisted men and women of the 130th Airlift Wing in Charleston, West Virginia, and the 167th Airlift Wing in Martinsburg, West Virginia. I share in your pride and I proudly recognize 1999, as ``The Year of the Enlisted Force.''

   Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I thank the Chair. 
   Mr. President, this is an extraordinary discussion, and it is one of those things where I believe we ill serve the American people because points are made too extremely. 
   The Senator from Idaho was making the point about driving people out of health care because of rising costs, and that is just flat out undeterminable. GAO says so. CBO says so. He quotes things that say they do. I say they do not. I will be happy to show him the language if he is interested in seeing it. 
   I do not know if this is about ideology or not or if it is about preaching. I have no idea. But I do know this, Mr. President: Clinical trials are incredibly important. This has been a battle a number of us, cancer groups and others, have been fighting for many years. My friend, the Senator from the State of Iowa, will expand on this more eloquently. 
   It is a terribly important fight. It is a question of, can people have access to clinical trials? Insurance companies used to pay for them. Insurance companies now do not pay for them. Some people have come to a point where they have exhausted--and they might be in their thirties and forties; we are not talking necessarily about people in their eighties or nineties but people in their thirties, forties, and fifties--every possible approach trying to do something about their very dreadful disease, which could be any number of things, not just cancer but any number of things. 
   The insurance companies used to pay for that. Now the HMOs will not, and they will not for a very good reason: because those things tend to be costly sometimes. 
   It comes down to the classic choice: Does the HMO get the advantage at the bottom line or does the patient get the advantage? That is the basic decision and the difference between Members on the two sides of the aisle who are otherwise informed and are trying to do the right thing on this subject. All of us are trying to do our best. 
   We have to have clinical trials. The usual and ordinary expenses associated with that have to be paid; otherwise, people will not be able to afford it; they will not get clinical trials; therefore, they will die or they have a chance of dying. Finally, of course, clinical trials often are the best experiment and research that can possibly be done because they lead to new discoveries and new opportunities. 
   I hope very much the Dodd amendment can be adopted. It is an extremely important amendment. When people hear ``clinical trials,'' they are not sure what we are talking about. There are hundreds of thousands of Americans at this point who have given up on regular therapies, but there is something out there on the cutting edge and they are ready to use it, but now the insurance companies will not pay for it, and the Democratic Patients' Bill of Rights will do that.

   Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, yesterday, I talked to a 56-year-old woman I have known for a long time in West Virginia. She has a rare heart disease. She has been struggling with it. She has now discovered that the operation she is potentially going to need is not available for her in West Virginia. She is going to have to go to another State far south in order to get that operation. The problem is that her insurance company said they will not pay for her operation. They said she will either get her operation in West Virginia, where this kind of operation is not readily available because it is rather rare or she won't 
   get it at all, or she has to pay for it herself. She is not a corporate giant. She runs a small business and has six people working for her. 
   This kind of thing should never happen. The Democratic bill would prevent that from happening. She would be able to go to that southern State where they do this kind of operation constantly and get that operation. That should happen in the United States of America. 
   Secondly, I talked with the physician of an 8-year-old girl 4 days ago. She has growth problems, seizure problems, and development problems, and she is under the care of a pediatric specialist in endocrinology and neurology at Western University. If you have a pediatric endocrinologist and somebody says you have to use an adult endocrinologist because that is in our plan, well, then people say, well, an endocrinologist is an endocrinologist. Not true. She will be denied care, and that is wrong.

   Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I rise today to join Senator CHAFEE and a bipartisan group in the introduction of the Foster Care Independence Act of 1999. I would like to thank Senator CHAFEE for his leadership on behalf of vulnerable young people, including our bipartisan work on this legislation. I also wish to thank the other co-sponsors of this legislation--Senators REED, BOND, LANDRIEU, MOYNIHAN, BREAUX, KERREY, MIKULSKI, and JEFFORDS. Work on this legislation is based on the foundation created by the bipartisan 1997 Adoption and Safe Families Act. 
   Our First Lady, Mrs. Clinton, has also been a special leader on behalf of vulnerable children. In 1997, she helped focus the national spotlight on the need to promote adoption. This year, she has helped to focus much needed attention on the challenges facing teenagers who age out of foster care, and has challenged us to improve the system for such teens by expanding the Independent Living program. 
   In 1997, a unique bipartisan Senate coalition formed to promote adoption and find ways to help our most vulnerable children, those subjected to abuse and neglected. After months of hard work, we forged consensus on the Adoption and Safe Families Act of 1997 (ASFA). This law, for the first time ever, establishes that a child's health and safety are paramount when any decisions are made regarding children in the abuse and neglect system. The law also stressed the importance of permanency to a child, and it imposed new time frames as goals for permanency. While this law was the most sweeping and comprehensive piece of child welfare legislation passed in over a decade, more work and resources will be crucial to truly achieve the goals of safety, stability and permanence for all abused and neglected children. 
   We have been pleased to learn that one of the desired outcomes of the Adoption Act, moving children more swiftly from foster care into permanent homes, has begun to become a reality. Adoptions throughout the country are up dramatically, far exceeding expectations. Yet, at the same time, we find that there continue to be approximately 20,000 young people each year who turn 18 and ``age out'' of the foster care system with no home, no family, no medical coverage and no system of support in place. In my own state of West Virginia, over 1000 of our foster children are over the age of 16. 185 of these children, in the last year, received services through the state's Independent Living program. 
   How do such teens in West Virginia and throughout the country fare? A Wisconsin study shows us that 18 months after leaving foster care, over one-third had not graduated from high school, half were unemployed, nearly half had no access to or coverage for health care, and many were homeless or victims or perpetrators of crimes. These are not just numbers, each of these statistics represents a real person, like Wendy or James: 
   Wendy had been in foster care since the age of 6. She had been moved again and again, and at the age of 14 was placed in a Wilderness Program for teens with challenging behaviors. At 16 she was moved to a locked residential facility. Her 18th birthday, in December, was a cold day in more ways than one. Early in the morning, a knock came on her door and she was told to get dressed and gather her things, as she was moving. This was not unusual for her, so she did as she was told. She went, with her meager possessions, to the front desk and asked, ``Where am I going?'' The staff person jingled the large key ring, opened the front door, looked out into the snowy day and said, ``Anywhere you want--you are 18 and you are on your own.'' One year later, Wendy was addicted to drugs, homeless and pregnant. She had no access to health care until she became pregnant--Her baby was now her ticket to care. 
   James had been in foster care since the age of 10. He had been moved ``only'' five or six times and when he turned 18, all services stopped. The foster family he had been living with could not afford to care for him any longer, but they agreed to allow him to sleep in their garage. He had to drop out of school in order to work full time at a pizza restaurant and attempt to support himself. When he turned 19, he had an opportunity to be adopted with some of his younger siblings. He immediately said, ``Yes!'' and when asked by the judge why he would want to be adopted at his age, he replied, ``I will always need a family, and someday, I hope my children will be able to have grandparents.'' James was able to re-enroll in school, graduate with a trade and is now a self-supporting married man. Oh, and his 3 children do have grandparents. 
   This legislation will provide resources and incentives to states so that more of our young people will have stories that end like James, and fewer that end like Wendy's. 
   One of the most significant provisions of ASFA was the assurance of ongoing health care coverage for all children with special needs who move from foster care to adoption. The Foster Care Independence Act is an essential next step in this ongoing process. This important legislation will ensure that health care coverage for our foster care youths does not end when they turn 18. All states who wish to receive the new Independent Living Program money must provide assurance that they will provide health care coverage to these young people through to the age of 21. Young people who have survived the many traumas that led to their placement in foster care, and their journey through the foster care system often have special health care needs, especially in the area of mental health. Providing transitional health coverage at this crucial juncture in their lives can make the difference between successfully moving on to accomplish their goals, or becoming stuck in an unsatisfying and unhealthy way of life. 
   Another key focus of ASFA is on moving children from foster care to permanent homes, and when possible adoption. Older teens in foster care have a great need for a permanent family. Although we propose to improve the Independent Living program and increase eligibility for services to the age of 21, it does end at that time. And yet a youth's need for a family does not end at any particular age. Each of us can clearly recall times when we have had to turn to our own families for advice, comfort or support long after our 18th or 21st birthdays. Many of us are still in the role of providing such support to our own children who are in their late teens or 20s. Therefore, an important provision in this Senate version of the Foster Care Independence Act states that Independent Living (IL) programs are not alternatives to permanency planning--young people of all ages need and deserve every possible effort made towards permanence, including adoption. It would be counterproductive to create any disincentive for adoption of teenagers. Therefore, our legislation would allow any enhanced independent living services, particularly health care, to continue until age 21 for those teens who are lucky enough to become adopted after 16 years old. 
   Independent Living programs were designed to provide young people with training, skill-development and support as they make the transition from foster care to self-sufficiency. In some states, with creativity and innovation, these programs have seen remarkable success in that effort. In other localities, the programs have provided minimal support, and young people have faced an array of challenging life decisions and choices without the skills or supports to make them successfully. This bill requires that states improve their Independent Living programs, by requiring youth involvement at every level, requiring youths to participate in on-going education and career development activities, and requiring that those youths for whom room and board services are provided also have adult supervision and support. 
   In short, this bill assists a very vulnerable group of young Americans by ensuring that they have access to: Health Care up to the age of 21; continued efforts to locate a permanent family; a quality Independent Living program providing a broad array of skills, resources and services; and a program that focuses on critical outcomes, especially in the areas of education, career development, and positive lifestyle choices. 
   These will be valuable steps in our efforts to be more able to effectively address the needs of our Nation's most vulnerable young people, on the brink of adulthood. I urge my colleagues to  join us in co-sponsoring and passing this bill.

   Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the ``Alternative Minimum Tax Reform Act of 1999'' with a bipartisan group of my colleagues on the Senate Finance Committee, Senators NICKLES, ROBB, HATCH and MACK. This bill is designed to improve the way the corporate alternative minimum tax works for capital intensive and commodity based companies. It is relatively modest in scope and I hope it will be part of any discussion we have about how we might deliver appropriate tax relief. Even though this bill does not change the fundamentals of the corporate AMT, it would eliminate some of the unfairness of current law by allowing companies with long term AMT credits to recover those credits faster. I think this bill should be part of the Finance Committee's discussions about constructive ways to provide corporate tax relief. 
   The alternative minimum tax imposes a significant long term tax burden on capital intensive industries --it is not a minimum tax, but is, in fact, a maximum tax which requires companies to calculate their taxes two different ways and pay the higher of the two calculations. It hits our manufacturing sector hard because these businesses are most likely to have to make large investments in plants and equipment. Manufacturing businesses that make commodity products often have slim profit margins and must contend with fierce international competition. The coal and steel industry are perfect examples of these types of industries. Other businesses with tight profit margins such as start up companies are also negatively affected by AMT. 
   Today, a taxpayer's AMT may be reduced by foreign tax credits and net operating losses, but they are limited to 90% of the alternative minimum tax. Under present law, if a taxpayer pays alternative minimum tax in any year, the amount of that payment is treated as an alternative minimum credit for future years. This was intended to ensure that companies did not wind up paying more under the AMT than was owed under the regular income tax. However, under current law, AMT credits may be used to reduce regular tax but not alternative minimum tax. No carryback of credits is permitted. 
   The provisions of the ``Alternative Minimum Tax Reform Act of 1999'' would allow a corporation with AMT credits that are unused after three or more years to reduce its tentative minimum tax by a maximum of 50% using those credits. The portion which would be allowed would the lesser of the aggregate amount of the taxpayer's AMT credits that are at least three years old; or 50% of the taxpayer's alternative minimum tax. The taxpayer would use its oldest AMT credits first under both current law that allows a company to use its AMT credits, and under the provisions of this bill. The bill would enhance a company's ability to use AMT credits to reduce its regular tax. Finally, the bill would allow a taxpayer with AMT net operating losses in the current and two previous years to carry back AMT net operating losses up to 10 years to offset AMT paid in previous years. First-in, and first-  out ordering would apply. This provision would help companies in the toughest financial shape. 
   The ``Alternative Minimum Tax Reform Act of 1999'' is designed to help prevent companies from being trapped permanently into AMT status. Recovering more AMT credits sooner will help ease the position of many companies who are now stuck with excess and unusable AMT credits. Too many companies have paid AMT for years and see no possibility of using their AMT credits without this reform. Moreover, a great many U.S. companies have had to deal with sharply decreasing commodity prices due to the collapse of markets in Asia and around the world over the last few years. Without some assistance it will be very hard for American companies to continue to modernize and remain competitive. Their position of accumulating excess AMT credits hurts their cash flow and their bottomline profitability. 
   The Alternative Minimum Tax Reform Act of 1999 is something reasonable we can do to help companies that are the backbone of our manufacturing base. I look forward to discussing this issue with my colleagues and to a score of how much this proposal would cost from the Joint Tax Committee to inform our discussions.

   Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I join what I suspect are one or two Democratic colleagues of mine who have come out to the floor to speak  about the Patients' Bill of Rights and the need to move forth with that. I think I am correct, but in listening to National Public Radio this morning, I heard that the American Medical Association was meeting and that one of the matters under discussion was the right of physicians to unionize. Since you cannot replay NPR, or ask for a repeat, I had to just hear what I heard; I think I heard it correctly. That is an amazing thing. I know physicians have been unionizing in Arizona and places where one would expect it. But to have the American Medical Association actually considering that, and the President, Dr. Dickie, a woman, discussing the frustration of physicians with their ability to give health care to their patients in a way that they believe and, in fact, were trained to do is extraordinary. 
   I could name any group in the world that would be looking for a place to find a union and I would put physicians among the very last. But, evidently, it is not that way. That in itself is an extraordinary call for this Congress to move forward with health care. The call comes from the American people also. They are calling for action on our part because of their sense of deep dissatisfaction. 
   Last year, we were told there wasn't enough time to take up a Patients' Bill of Rights. I don't think that could be the case this year, since time seems to be mostly what we have, and 
   therefore one might conclude there might be a lack of willingness to take up a Patients' Bill of Rights this year. So we have to keep our priorities straight. I intend to, and I think a lot of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle feel that way. 
   Every single day that passes without enactment of patient protections is another day that millions of Americans, and thousands of the people I represent from West Virginia, are subject to the denial of needed treatments because of the instinct of insurance companies to go to their bottom line and stay there. Every single day that we, as a Congress, fail to act on the Patients' Bill of Rights is another day that Americans are left vulnerable to health care decisions that are made perhaps not by their doctors, as they wish, but by business executives, or by boards, or people at the end of 1-800 numbers. We used to talk about this years ago, and we agreed it was a terrible thing and it had to stop. We were all going to do that, except that we have not. We just haven't. 
   Every day we don't act, Americans are refused, No. 1, the specialty treatments they need and deserve; No. 2, the ability to use any emergency room. 
   Imagine that. The Senator from Illinois is here. This Senator remembers being in Chicago a number of years ago, for whatever purpose, and I was told that six emergency rooms in the city of Chicago were closed, and there were relatively few left. That is one of the largest cities in all of America. Emergency rooms are the most expensive form of health care, and they are always the things closed down when business decisions are dominating hospitals. 
   On the other hand, the only way, having 43 million, 44 million, 45 million uninsured Americans, they can get health insurance is by going to emergency rooms. They have to have that right. It has to be accessible to them, not just somewhere out in the next State, or on the other side of the Mississippi River but accessible so they can get to it. 
   Third, they have to have the right to appeal the decision of their health care plans. It is a basic right. I will talk more about it. 
   Fourth, they should have the ability to ensure that medical decisions are made by their doctors, not by a board of executives. 
   We all know that managed care has changed the way health care is done in this country. We started saying that in the Finance Committee 10 or 12 years ago. The question was, Does managed care save money for 1 year or 2 years? The general consensus was that managed care would save money for about 2 years, then it would come up against a hard wall and people would have to start cutting. That was the general consensus then. It is clearly showing itself to be even more the case now. That is for both delivery and the payment of health care in our country. 
   Obviously, a lot of problems have been created along the way. Americans are very dissatisfied with the quality of their health care. They make their feelings about that very clear. They don't like their lack of choice. They don't like the indiscriminate nature of insurance company decisionmaking. 
   Meanwhile, physicians often have, from their point of view --and from my point of view--much too little input into health care decisions, and hence the NPR story this morning. They believe so strongly that they are doing something, which is an anathema, it would seem to me, to any physician. But they are evidently doing this, or they are voting on that as a matter of ``doctor rights,'' or whatever, at the American Medical Association meeting. 
   I think doctors think they face too much interference from the insurance companies. Patients and doctors alike see health care decisions driven by the financial concerns of something called health plans. What do we have to do? We have to guarantee access to specialty care. I hear it all the time. We all hear it all the time in our homes and wherever we go. 
   Under managed care plans--most of them, not all of them--the patient's primary care physician may refer a patient to a specialist if they determine that specialty care is necessary. However, things may change, if the specialist is not on the list of the plan. 
   Then you come to this amazing situation of trying to ask a consumer of health care to understand that they are allowed to go to a specialist, but they cannot because that specialist is not on their plan. Even the much criticized Clinton health care plan allowed that. You could always go outside your HIPAA. You could always go to your specialist, no matter where your specialist was. You could always go to your specialist. Under the present system of health care, you can't do that. 
   Then somebody from the ``administrative office,'' or some other division, takes over this whole question of whether you can or whether you can't. Suddenly, the patient asks to see a specialist and finds out that the executives in charge are not doctors. They are not medical people. They refuse the right to go see a specialist. They refuse payment for the specialist who in fact was recommended by the patient's original primary care physician. That is wrong. 
   We must put an end to insurance company ``gag rules.'' That is another point. 
   Patients need to trust the providers--that they are acting in the best interests of the patients. There cannot be a situation where HMOs preclude doctors from prescribing necessary treatments or making referrals to a specialist in the name of preserving the company's bottom line. 
   There is a sacred trust between a patient and a doctor. I don't have to elaborate on that. It is Norman Rockwell stuff. In fact, there are many, many. He did many pictures of it. It 
   is the classic American situation--the trust between, the bond between, the patient and the doctor. 
   For the doctor to be second-guessed by an insurance company bureaucrat just doesn't make sense. 
   I have listened to literally hundreds of patients and doctors complain that managed care plans are making decisions about care, about what types of procedures are allowed and are not allowed, and this decision just creates a division between the patient and the doctor. The patient is confused. The doctor is angry. It is not right. 
   Another point: Real access to emergency room care 24 hours a day has to be. It has to be 7 days a week. Wherever they are, it has to be. They cannot be concerned about their insurance company second-guessing their health concerns. 
   Americans must be able to go to the nearest emergency room without the fear that they will not be able to afford it, and they must be able to receive all necessary care in that facility to take care of their situation. 
   In the United States of America we have been through this before. We are the only country in the world that doesn't have universal health insurance. If we don't have that, at least let's allow a Patients' Bill of Rights so that people can have--including those who are not insured--certain rights. 
   Another point: We must let people challenge the decisions made by HMOs  and seek retribution when HMO decisions lead to harm. 
   Is that radical? No. That is a standard part of American life, except it is more important in a lot of American life because of the actual health and physical safety of a patient. When Americans go to a doctor, they should get the care they need. If they don't get it, they should have the means and the right to address disputes. They should not have to worry about insurance companies cutting that off. 
   A central element of the Democratic Patients' Bill of Rights is that point--the ability to hold health care plans accountable for the medical decisions that lead to harm. 
   The Republican plan fails to hold HMOs accountable. Under the Republican plan, the only remedy available when a patient is harmed by an HMO decision is recovery of the actual cost of a denied procedure, even if the patient is already dead or disabled for life. 
   Make no mistake. If we don't respond quickly and forcefully enough, more and more Americans are going to lose confidence in our system and in us. Already 90 percent of Americans are unhappy with their plan. Shocking, shocking. We can do something about it. I think we have a moral obligation to take up the Patients' Bill of Rights. We certainly have the time because we are not doing a whole lot of other things around here that I can put my hands on. I think it is time that Congress take up and pass these patient protections this year. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I thank my colleague from Pennsylvania, who equally has been a distinguished leader on this issue. 
   Mr. President, the previous speaker, my esteemed chairman of the Finance Committee, talked about voting on a quota bill. We are not voting on a quota bill today. We are voting on a motion to proceed. This whole steel situation is very complex. Most States do not produce steel, and a lot of people do not know about some of the complexities. 
   We deserve debate on this. Traditionally, in the Senate we do that. That is what we are here for, to iron out issues in a rational way. 
   The steel crisis is not over. It is not over at all. You talk to any steel CEO. They know it is not over. I will just give one statistic. That is all I will give. 
   If you take the first 4 months of 1999, which brings us almost up to today, versus the first 4 months of 1998, which was the worst of the steel crisis, yes, the steel import crisis has abated a little bit, but only 5 percent 
   from the all-time historic high in the dumping of subsidized steel. It has decreased by a total of 5 percent across the steel front. 
   So the crisis remains with us. It is a very serious matter. It disrupts and undoes communities, sections of States across this country, not just West Virginia, Pennsylvania, and Utah, but the rest of them. I do not think we have done what we could have done to enforce our trade laws. They are very clear. The administration has not done what it could have done. But that day is past. So we have to do what we have to do, and that brings us to the quota bill. This is not the bill itself; this is the motion to proceed to discuss what we are going to do as a result of that vote. 
   I think we have a moral obligation to our steelworkers and to ourselves to honorably and fairly discuss something that is very complex and which needs our very closest attention. 
   I thank the Presiding Officer and yield the remainder of my time.

   Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I will not even take that amount of time. Senator GRAMM and Senator NICKLES and others, have said vote against this bill. You will have a chance to vote against this bill. That is not what we are about today. We are voting on the motion to proceed to discuss an extraordinarily complex issue, the ramifications of which a lot of people do not know. It has been pointed out we are in violation of WTO. It has not been pointed out we are trying to follow our Trade Act, which we ourselves passed in the Congress and which was signed by a previous President. 
   Please, this is the motion to proceed. We traditionally are fair about these things. This is a complex subject. Steel is only produced in 16 States in a major way. A lot of people have a lot to learn. 
   We are not voting on the quota bill. We are voting on the motion to proceed to simply talk about it. We have had a very high barrier to reach. 
   Finally, I say the crisis is not over. I repeat that. The first 4 months of this year compared to the first 4 months of last year--last year being the worst year in history in terms of imports--steel imports were only down by 5 percent. The crisis lives. The time to vote for an honest discussion of the issue is now. We can do that by voting yes on the motion to proceed.

   Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce the ``Veterans' Long-Term Care Enhancement Act of 1999.'' There is no doubt that demand for long-term care--for veterans and non-veterans alike--is increasing. In the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), however, we face an even more pressing demand. 
   The numbers are staggering. About 34 percent of the total veteran population is 65 years or older, compared with about 13 percent of the total United States population. In the year 2000, the number of veterans aged 65 or older will peak at 9.3 million. In my state of West Virginia alone, we have approximately 57,000 World War II veterans. 
   Because VA has already faced considerable demand for long-term care, it has been forced to become a leader in this field. I am proud of VA's work in developing geriatric evaluation teams, home-based primary care, and adult day health care. Our older veterans are leading richer lives because of these innovations. But to quote from the Report of the Federal Advisory Committee on the Future of VA Long-Term Care, despite VA's high quality and long tradition, ``VA long-term care is marginalized and unevenly funded.'' 
   Frequently I hear from families of World War II combat veterans who need long-term care because of a debilitating disease, such as Alzheimer's or Parkinson's, or a stroke. A number of these families do not have the money to place the veteran in a private nursing home for the necessary long-term care; and because of the veteran's sacrifices during World War II, they turn to the VA. 
   Or I will get a call from a wife of an aging, sick veteran who wants desperately to keep her husband at home with her, but in order to do that she needs home health care services, so she turns to the VA. 
   But when these West Virginian families are told by VA that the services they need are not available to them, they simply cannot understand how they could be denied, and they turn to me in despair. 
   The challenge for all of us, of course, is to find a way to furnish the appropriate array of services, in a cost efficient way, to all those needing extended care. 
   As the Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs noted in its March 15, 1999, letter to the Budget Committee with the Committee's views on VA's budget for FY 2000, ``The health care issue that VA must face over the intermediate term--indeed, the health care issue that the Nation must face over the next decade--is the need for long-term care among the aging World War II generation. WWII veterans saved Western civilization. We cannot turn our backs on them now.'' 
   At the outset, I want to say that my wish would be for VA to provide long-term care to all veterans who need and want it. While the legislation I am introducing today is only one step toward determining what VA should be doing to meet the needs of veterans for long-term care, I believe that it is an important step in that regard. 
   There are three key elements in the bill. First, are provisions which clarify that long-term care is not only nursing home care, and that existing differences in law between eligibility for institutional long-term care and other types of care offered by VA do not affect VA's ability to furnish a full array of noninstitutional long-term care services. 
   Specifically, the provision would add ``noninstitutional extended care services'' to the definition of ``medical services,'' thereby removing any doubt about VA's authority to furnish such services to veterans eligible for and enrolled in VA care. The term would be defined to include the following: home-based primary care; adult day health care; respite care; palliative and end-of-life care; and homemaker or home health aide visits. 
   Second, the bill would add clear authority for VA to furnish assisted living services, including to the spouses of veterans. VA already furnishes a form of assisted living services through its domiciliary care program, but the provision in the bill would provide express authority to furnish this modality of care to older veterans, thereby expanding the continuum of extended care services offered by VA. 
   Third, VA would be mandated to carry out a series of pilot programs, over a period of three years, which would be designed to gauge the best way for VA to meet veterans' long-term care needs--either directly, through cooperative arrangements with community providers, or by purchasing services from non-VA providers. 
   While VA has developed significant expertise in long-term care over the past 20-plus years, it has not done so with any mandate to share its learning with others, nor has it pushed its program development beyond that which met the current needs at the time. Some experts even believe that VA's expertise is gradually eroding. 
   For VA's expertise to be of greatest use to others, it needs both to better capture what it has done and to develop new learning that would be most applicable to other health care entities. 
   Those who would benefit by further action to develop and capitalize on VA's long-term care expertise include older veterans, primarily our honored World War II veterans; those health organizations, including academic medicine and research entities, with which VA is now connected; and finally, the rest of the U.S. health care system, and ultimately all Americans who will need some form of long-term care services. 
   Each element of the pilot program would establish and carry out a comprehensive long-term care program, with a full array of services, ranging from inpatient long-term care--in intermediate care beds, in nursing homes, and in domiciliary care facilities--to comprehensive noninstitutional services, which include hospital-based home care, adult day health care, personal assistance services, respite care, and other community-base interventions. 
   In each element of the pilot programs, VA would also be mandated to furnish case management services, to ensure that veterans participating in the pilot programs receive the optimal treatment and placement for services. Some form of assisted living services for veterans and their families would be provided, as well. Preventive health care services, such as screening and patient education, and a particular focus on end-of-life care are also emphasized. In my view, VA must have ready access to all of these services. 
   As part of the pilot program, VA would be encouraged to seek the involvement of State Veterans Homes, so as to draw them into noninstitutional approaches to long-term care. Our State Veterans Homes are valuable assets.  
   Finally, a key purpose of the pilot program would be to test and evaluate various approaches to meeting the long-term care needs of eligible veterans, both to develop approaches that could be expanded across VA, as well as to demonstrate to others outside of VA the effectiveness and impact of various approaches to long-term care. To this end, the pilot program within in the ``Veterans' Long-Term Care Enhancement Act of 1999'' would include specific data collection on matters such as cost effectiveness, quality of health care services provided, enrollee and health care provider satisfaction, and the ability of participants to carry out basic activities of daily living. 
   From this effort, a number of things would result. First, VA would gain more precise information on exactly which services to offer, how best to coordinate those services, and the relative cost and effectiveness of various services. There is no doubt that our veterans would benefit from such findings. 
   Second, there would be a concrete demonstration of the feasibility of furnishing a coordinated range of long-term care services, which in turn could lead to a greater likelihood that such an approach would be shared with, and replicated by, others. 
   Third, the value of such an approach, measured in quality of care, quality of life, cost effectiveness, and patient and provider satisfaction would be demonstrated, thereby promoting its use by others. 
   Mr. President, I look forward to working with the chairmen and the members of the Committees on Veterans' Affairs--in both the House of Representatives and the Senate--to advance the cause of long-term care in VA.

    Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I ask that we take a moment today to recognize the State of West Virginia. One hundred thirty-six years ago, on June 20, 1863, West Virginia assumed its proud position as the 35th State of the Union. Since that time West Virginia's natural resources and its citizens have and will continue to play a positive role in our Nation. 
   The phrases: ``the mountain state,'' ``wild, wonderful,'' and ``a welcome change'' are always reminders of West Virginia. Indeed, there are countless rolling hills dotted with horses, cows, sheep and their young. The State is home to memorable valleys, known for their rushing streams and rivers filled with bass and trout. Then there are the beautiful colors throughout the fall and spring that bedeck our glorious mountains, attracting tourists from across the globe. 
   West Virginia is a combination of rural farming communities, coal towns, resorts, and growing cities. It is unquestionably a State in which there is a place for everyone. I believe it is this diversity that attracts many to the State and causes numerous children raised in West Virginia to remain and invest in the State as adults. 
   West Virginians are proud of their State. As we stand at the dawn of the 21st century symbols of West Virginia pride and achievement can be heard, read, seen, and touched throughout the world via locally produced music, literature, works of art, and crafts. West Virginians are also proud of their people. Almost two centuries, ago, the State was known as the fighting place of the Hatfields and McCoys. Since that time, West Virginia has been the home of such remarkable people as, educator Booker T. Washington, pilot Charles ``Chuck'' Yeager, gymnast Mary Lou Retton, authors Pearl S. Buck, John Knowles, and Denise Giardina, singer and song writer Kathy Mattea, artists Barrie Kaufman, and Susan Poffenbarger, former astronaut Jon A. McBride, scholar Henry Louis Gates, countless athletes, and numerous others. 
   Today we have the opportunity to honor 136 years of statehood. I ask that we celebrate the people of West Virginia, that we honor the courage of their endeavors and achievements. I ask that we take strength from the majesty of the mountains as do the constituents of West Virginia, and finally that we, as members of this distinguished body, remember the broader message of freedom recognized by West Virginia's logo: Montani Semper Liberi, Mountaineers are Always Free. I am proud of this State and its people and am honored to represent them.

   Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I thank my friend from New Mexico. 
   Mr. President, in a sense what we have now is the torch being passed. Any number of Senators have described--and I will not, therefore, try to repeat any of that--how this whole steel crisis, not to mention the oil patch crisis, has developed. 
   It started in 1997. In the history of recorded trade statistics, as long as our country has been keeping trade statistics, there has never been an import surge of the magnitude, in any commodity at any time, as there has been in the last 2 years in steel. It started off with three countries; it is now all over the world. 
   The Secretary of Commerce put out a release saying it is wonderful the steel crisis is over. I wonder where he has been. 
   We should understand that the steel crisis is deep. If you take the first quarter of 1999, the first 3 months of 1999, and compare that to the worst possible months of the steel crisis, the first quarter of 1998, last year, the total improvement which the administration keeps trying to talk about--I think they know it is wrong and the administration realized it hasn't done anything about this problem and it will be paying a price for it--the total decline from the 1998 first quarter to the 1999 first quarter is a total of 5 percent worldwide on all steel. That is going from the worst steel statistics in history and a 5-percent decrease. That could go right back up. 
   The torch has to pass from the administration protecting our national trade laws, protecting free and fair trade, to us. Now we have to do something about it because they have declined to. 
   I have been to everybody all the way up to the President and Vice President on a number of occasions. Expressions of interest but no results, no action taken. 
   This affects the lives of my people; it affects the lives of people in many States. I hate to see that. 
   I used this analogy on the Finance Committee. Football is a rough sport, as is international trade. International trade is a rough sport. Everybody is trying to get the advantage of everybody else and undersell. In football, you can get hurt--any individual player, a large or small player. They have rules. That is why we have rules. That is why they have referees. 
   If you are a linebacker and you charge through the line and you get through and you hit the quarterback on the helmet with your elbow, you are penalized. You know that beforehand and you may get thrown out of the game for that. 
   If you are inbounds and you are a pass catcher and you run out of bounds, that is no good. You jump offside, you get penalized. 
   Everybody knows the rules. The more they play the game, the more they know what the rules are. That is what has kept the integrity of the game, because of its predictability. Secondly, it kept a lot of people from getting their heads taken off and knees broken. Football is tough anyway, as is international trade. 
   So, there are rules. We have rules in international trade too. And we set them; the Congress set them and the administration set them in previous years. It is the Trade Act of 1974. It sets out a whole series of these rules. The administration keeps saying we are going to abide by the rules; we are abiding by the rules; we plan to abide by the rules. Of course, they are not. So the torch is passed to us. And there are a couple of points there I need to make. 
   The bill is incredibly important. There is also a bill going to be taken up on a cloture vote next week, on steel quotas, which is incredibly important. It is very important for my colleagues and their staffs to understand; the vote this afternoon on this excellent bill of Senator BYRD and Senator DOMENICI and the bill next week which deals with imports are totally separate and different; that if you vote for this one, it does not mean it solves the import problem, or if you vote for that one, it doesn't solve the financial problem that this bill helps with. They are separate bills. 
   So anybody who says, I voted today for Byrd-Domenici; therefore, I do not have to worry about next week because we have taken care of the problem, does not understand there are two totally different subjects. I cannot make that point strongly enough. This one is about the finances of companies that are going under, giving them a chance at commercial rates, repayable--to go to banks, because they cannot now borrow, and to be able to borrow a little bit, to survive a little bit longer--whether it is the steel mill or the oil patch. That is terribly important for the viability of those industries. 
   Then, equally important, since this bill has nothing to do with the import problem which created all of this--that is what next week's vote has to do with, the problem of the imports and how do we adjust the import problem on a short-term basis to bring some fairness to what we like to call free trade but which is practiced virtually only by us. It used to be practiced by Hong Kong. I don't know how they are on it now. But it is practiced by nobody else in the world. So all the steel comes into us: India, up 72 percent; Indonesia, 60-something--it doesn't matter where you go, the numbers are up, because they know, the word is out, if you want to dump subsidized or underpriced steel in the United States, they will take it. So it puts people out of work. It does not matter to them. They will go ahead and take it. 
   That is what I call the best way to destroy the possibility of a national coalition for a trading system, which I believe in. I am somebody who has always voted for fast track and somebody who believes in engaging the world. I have worked very hard within my own State--which is not particularly an international State in its viewpoint, being landlocked in the mountains, so to speak--to make my people understand the global economy is part of their economy, we are all part of each other's economies, and we can sell products to other countries and they can invest in West Virginia, and this is all good; so we are all part of an international trading system.  
   But there have to be rules in that. If you allow the quarterback to have his head given a concussion, it is very important the referee be there. But the referee usually does not have to be there, because people know what the price will be: You will get tossed out of the game or you will get a penalty of 15 yards. So all kinds of fair play is carried on on 
   the football field, because people know what the rules are. 
   Again, the torch is passed to us, and I think we have two duties. One is, we have to pass this excellent bill this afternoon. We should have passed it much earlier when it was the subject of earlier consideration. Then it got done in, in conference. I am terribly glad Senator BYRD, my senior colleague, and Senator DOMENICI, have combined forces to help on this. 
   Frankly, it is important to combine forces sometimes on bills around here, because there are only 16 States that are major producers of steel. I do not know how many States produce oil, but I suspect there are not that many. So this is a very good opportunity for us to give those companies a chance to go to the bank, to get some money to be able to exist for a few more months or another year or so. It is not going to do anything about the import problem, which is the real cause of the devastating human crisis in steel. 
   So we, as a legislature, as a Congress, have to decide, as the House has already decided by an overwhelming margin, that steel is important to America. This is not just a question of West Virginia or Ohio or Minnesota or other places; this is a national crisis. Senator DOMENICI has said, I don't know how many times: When Members on my side of the aisle--the other side of the aisle--come up to me and say I have this milk support problem, I have this farm support problem, I have this food support problem, I have whatever it is, I am always there. I am always there, because I believe it is as if you built the interstate system in this country and, because Pennsylvania is bigger than West Virginia, you made it four lanes in Pennsylvania but you only made it two lanes in West Virginia and then it went back to four lanes in Ohio. That would not be very smart. No. 1, it wouldn't fulfill the work of a national defense highway system. No. 2, it would cause massive traffic jams. 
   So we understand we are all part of each other's destiny. West Virginia, insofar as I have been able to determine, has no oceans on our boundaries, but we pay taxes to support the Coast Guard. That is as it should be, because we have an obligation to each other, as West Virginia does to those who use the Coast Guard on coastal areas in different parts of the country. So that is part of our compact in America. It is part of our contract with each other, that when a region needs help, when an industry needs help, if there is a reason and possibility of doing so, you try to do that. 
   This one is particularly good because it helps companies get money they cannot otherwise get. The international trade situation is more complex and, in the longer run, will probably do more to solve the problem, because it actually deals with the level of imports. It says to other nations, we are not going to be Uncle Sucker forever, or, in this case, at least for a period of 3 years. It is not radical. People think, what are we doing this for? 
   What is interesting is that over the years the average foreign imports of steel into the United States--over the last 30 years, let's take it--is probably less than 20 percent. Less than 20 percent is usually what foreign countries export into this country, what we therefore import into this country; less than 20 percent of all the steel we use comes from other countries. That is the way it has been. That is perfectly acceptable as a figure. 
   Interestingly enough, in the bill coming up next week, that figure can range as high as 23 percent, certainly no lower than 18 or 19 percent. It is only for 3 years. But it is a way of saying we in America, if we are going to get into this, deeper and deeper into the international trading system, we really do care about our rules. We really do think about our quarterback's head. We think the chop blocking, which can break a young man's knees or legs, is wrong, and there are rules about that. We actually passed those rules in the Congress, and the President signed them all in a previous era, and they apply today, and we all live by them--except that we do not. 
   So, in closing, I want to say these are two distinctly important decisions we are going to be making in separate weeks on separate bills. The one today is filled with merit. It is tremendously important. It is part of the comprehensive solution to the problem. 
   But, then again, the one next week is the one that deals with imports, and it is the only one that deals with imports. So we need to do both of those so no Senator thinks that, because that Senator has made a particular vote on one day, he does not have to face up to the same situation on another day, because they are entirely different problems that each bill addresses. 
   This is a matter of high urgency in the part of the country I come from. I was Governor of West Virginia for 8 years, and I dealt in 1982 and 1983 with 21-percent unemployment. That is not a whole lot of fun, when 1 out of every 5 people you pass does not have work. There is not a family in West Virginia that is not accustomed to not having work or has not dealt with it. 
   We are on the way back, but we are going to get knocked down if this steel import crisis continues. I do not want that to happen to Ohio. I do not want that to happen to Pennsylvania. I do not want to have that happen to Arkansas, Utah, Texas, or any other State. I do not want that to happen. It does not have to happen, and it is not even a budget matter. It is a matter of fair trade, fair play, rules that we have passed and by which we should live. 
   I thank the Presiding Officer, and I yield the floor.

    Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, last week, President Lee Teng-hui of Taiwan announced that Taiwan would be giving $300 million in an aid package to the Kosovars. I want to rise today and pay tribute and thank the Government of the Republic of China on Taiwan for this very generous gift of economic assistance. This aid includes emergency support for food, shelters, and medical care which is so desperately needed to return a sense of normalcy to the Albanian Kosovars. Also included in the aid package is funds for job-training and rehabilitation programs to help promote the reconstruction of Kosovo in the long run. 
   This is just another remarkable example of the thoughtfulness and generosity of the people in Taiwan and should serve as a model for the entire international community. I would like to ask my colleagues to join me in expressing our deep appreciation to President Lee and the people of Taiwan for this compassionate offer. Hopefully, this act will encourage other nations to aid in rebuilding the Balkans so that the people there can move past the horrible atrocities that have been committed over the past few months and begin rebuilding their lives and families in peace.

   Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, the overriding point to be made today is that the vast majority of the Senate, Democrats and Republicans, and the White House, agree on the need for legislation to encourage Y2K readiness and to prevent frivolous litigation. 
   We all agree that there is likely to be a surge in Y2K related complaints and lawsuits and that everyone will benefit if many of those cases can be dealt with outside the courtroom. We agree on the need to encourage consumers and businesses to use remediation to fix Y2K problems and to use negotiation to settle disputes. 
   Where we differ is on the details of how to get there. And let me assure you from my 11 years of experience as a proponent of product liability reform--the details matter. 
   And the details should matter. In liability reforms, and especially tort reforms, what's at stake is the basic balance between plaintiffs and defendants, consumers and business, injured and responsible parties. Our state courts and legislatures have struggled for several hundred years to get that balance right. If we're going to change their work then we have a responsibility to work hard at getting the details right, too. 
   Senators KERRY and DASCHLE deserve a great deal of credit for wading into the middle of the Y2K liability reform issue. I've been in their shoes before, and I know how hard it is to try to find the middle ground. It is no easy feat to craft a bill that protects consumers, gives business the predictability and relief from frivolous suits they deserve, wins the support of the majority in Congress, and would secure a presidential signature. 
   Senators KERRY and DASCHLE came up with a bill that gives the high-tech community about 80 percent of what they want, that meets every one of the objections outlined by the White House, and that won 41 votes in the Senate last week. I voted for that bill. 
   Forty-one votes, including the votes of many Senators who hold strong reservations about federalizing any part of our tort liability system at all. Forty-one votes shows us in plain terms that there is obvious overlap on the core issues and principals of this bill, and on a good many of the details. 
   What is so regrettable is that even after our negotiating a bill that gives most stakeholders most of what they say they need, my Republican colleagues and much of the business community would rather have an issue than a bill. A negotiated compromise that gives them 80 percent of what they want but also keep the courts open to legitimate claims apparently isn't enough. 
   So rather than achieve a major portion of their goals for the year 2000, they've decided to put all of us through an exercise that will result in nothing. Believe me, I've been down this road before. I know these issues, I know these stakeholders, I know the vote counts, and I know this White House on liability reforms. And I know what the outcome will be if we continue down this dead-end path. 
   What baffles me is to see the business community, once again, choose nothing. Haven't we learned from years of legislating on liability reforms that purists come away emptyhanded? 
   The bottom line is that the bill before us today is simply too far afield of what's doable. And the best way to get back on course for enacting a Y2K law is to vote against this bill and sit down at the negotiating table. 
   Unlike the never-ending products liability debate the opportunity to deal with Y2K suits won't last long. We can't afford to get it wrong. And we don't have time to pass a bill that we know will be vetoed and then come back to the drawing board. 
   I urge my colleagues not to squander this opportunity.

    Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, today, I would like to pay tribute to Mr. David S. Liederman, the outgoing Executive Director of the Child Welfare league of America. Throughout his long, distinguished career, David Liederman has fought hard to make a difference in the lives of families and children, especially some of the most vulnerable children who are at risk of abuse and neglect. 
   Over many years, I have been privileged to work directly with David Liederman and the extraordinary team of dedicated professionals whom he has assembled at the Child Welfare League of America (CWLA). David has the unique ability to be a leader on a variety of levels--within his own organization, throughout the country with many CWLA affiliates, and in Washington as a policy maker and advocate. 
   Early in his career, he had the vision and the determination to seek bold policy answers by helping to creating the original Independent Living Program. We worked closely together in 1993 to secure over a billion dollars in new investments in prevention services for abused and neglected children. In 1997, David was an effective ally and advocate in the effort to enact the Adoption and Safe Families Act which ensures that a child's health and safety are paramount, and continues the investments in prevention to deliver on this promise. 
   Those who know David Liederman's personal history are not surprised by his commitment, or his successful record of accomplishments. David began his career working directly with families and serving disadvantaged youths living in public housing in the Boston area. These years in the trenches instilled in him a sense of compassion and the challenges wrought by the harsh realities many of our Nation's citizens face. After working in direct services, he went on to serve the people of Massachusetts first in the State Legislature and then as Chief of Staff  to Governor Michael Dukakis. After years of service in Massachusetts, David decided to focus on National issues when he accepted the helm of the Child Welfare League of America (CWLA) and began to lead national discussions setting the agenda on policy issues facing children and families. For fifteen years, he led CWLA and was a well-known advocate and spokesman for needy children and families. 
   In honor of his many achievements, David Liederman won the 1996 Award for Excellence in national Executive Leadership and the 1997 National Lifetime Achievement Award from the national Association of Social Workers. 
   I am proud to have worked with David Liederman over so many years, and am proud to call him a friend. His voice will be truly missed on child welfare issues in Washington, But he has our best wishes as he seeks new challenges and opportunities in public service.

    Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, it is my honor to commend the West Virginia Division of Criminal Justice Services (DCJS) for its outstanding compliance monitoring program. The exceptional quality of this program has been recognized by Attorney General Janet Reno and the Department of Justice as an example of how a monitoring program should work. All new Juvenile Justice Compliance Monitors will travel to West Virginia to be trained by DCJS staff. 
   The West Virginia Division of Criminal Justice Services has an admirable track record of meeting or surpassing the goals set for juvenile justice systems by federal and state regulations. In August 1998, a five-year compliance audit of the DCJS reported a faultless monitoring system for its juvenile justice and delinquency programs (JJDP). West Virginians are right to be proud of the efficient, organized system in use by DCJS, and we can take even more pride in the fact that the DCJS compliance monitoring program will serve as a guide for compliance monitors throughout the country. West Virginia expertise and innovation will be instrumental in streamlining juvenile justice and delinquency prevention programs. 
   The recent acclaim for West Virginia's compliance monitoring program is a reflection of the many other virtues within the Division's purview. The success of the Juvenile Crime Enforcement Coalition plan has prompted other states' juvenile justice agencies to model their programs after West Virginia's. In her speech, Attorney General Reno noted our state's Underage Drinking Plan as a possible approach for other jurisdictions. To their credit, the staff and management of DCJS do not invest these laurels with more importance than they have. The hard-working people of DCJS understand that one of their agency's greatest strengths is the sharing of responsibility and expertise among DCJS, state juvenile justice facilities, and other state agencies in complying with regulations. Rather than imposing its will on the agencies with which it works, DCJS builds lasting relationships with correctional facilities to help meet statutory and administrative mandates in a cooperative fashion. 
   Further, DCJS operates with a definite purpose and an open mind. The agency is firmly grounded in law, yet remains flexible with respect to improvements and changes in regulations. Such a balance is particularly important in the juvenile justice and delinquency prevention context, where frequent governmental experiments result in the involvement of new agencies and new personnel, and increased societal vigilance adds even more members to the pool of at-risk youth. Finally, through its carefully organized and straightforward monitoring program, DCJS strives to teach while it continues to serve. In so many respects, the West Virginia DCJS juvenile justice program is a model for the nation. 
   I wish to express my sincere admiration and heartfelt thanks to the Division of Criminal Justice Services for making juvenile justice services in West Virginia, and now the rest of America, more efficient and effective.

    Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I am proud to be an original cosponsor of the Character Counts! initiative introduced by Senator DOMENICI and others on May 6, 1999. I avidly support education in West Virginia and the United States, and I believe this should include an emphasis on basic character and good citizenship. In the words of Theodore Roosevelt: ``To educate a person in mind and not in morals is to educate a menace to society.'' 
   Character Counts! recognizes and addresses that there is a connection between one's personal life and one's business or political abilities. Character Counts! understands that morals and character development go hand in hand, and that it is never too late to teach the tools to help develop personal character. The promotion of healthy character development is a necessary precursor to reaching the ultimate goal of teaching people to take personal responsibility. 
   The Character First! training series is based in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. The Character Bulletin Series provides  a flexible system that is designed to meet any needs or schedule. It uses a monthly four-step program to teach necessary tools for character development. The first step of every month is a Character Bulletin. This provides a character quality, such as virtue, along with tools to help build it. The second step contains Supplements, including the Introducing ``Character'' Leadership Supplement, which provides additional resources for teaching others about the character quality, and Building ``Character'' Leadership Notes, which challenges those in positions of leadership to hold themselves to higher standards. The third step is called Character at Home, and provides ways to use the Character Bulletin Series at home. This step is particularly helpful for parents who want to play an active role in their child's development. The final part of the series is a Character Poster, a full color poster to remind people of the quality of the month. Recently a cooperative effort to promote Character Counts! began in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. Their city-wide effort involves government personnel, businesses, churches, schools, and others in the community. We should celebrate this city-wide effort to educate people about character and implement the Character Counts! program in other communities nationwide. 
   Educating people about character and citizenship is crucial to create healthy communities. Years ago, as Chairman of the National Commission on Children, I worked hard to include an entire chapter in our comprehensive report called Creating a Moral Climate because I felt strongly about the issue. Everyone of us has an obligation to create such a climate for our family, our friends, and especially children in our communities. 
   Character Counts! provides this type of leadership and resources to support character education which will promote continuous growth and development. It is our responsibility to educate people, and I commend Character Counts! for providing a much needed educational service.

   Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I am pleased to offer my support to the Veterans' Access to Emergency Care Act of 1999. This bill will authorize VA to cover emergency care at non-Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) facilities for those veterans who have enrolled with VA for their health care. I join my colleague, Senator DASCHLE, in cosponsoring this valuable initiative and thank him for his leadership. 
   Currently, VA is restricted by law from authorizing payment of comprehensive emergency care services in non-VA facilities except to veterans with special eligibility. Most veterans must rely on other insurance or pay out of pocket for emergency services. 
   I remind my colleagues that VA provides a standard benefits package for all veterans who are enrolled with the VA for their health care. In many ways, this is a very generous package, which includes such things as pharmaceuticals. Enrolled veterans are, however, missing out on one essential part of health care coverage: the standard benefits package does not allow for comprehensive emergency care. So, in effect, we are asking veterans to choose VA health care, but leaving them out in the cold when it comes to emergency care. 
   Mr. President, we have left too many veterans out in the cold already. When veterans call their VA health care provider in the middle of the night, many reach a telephone recording. This recording likely urges that veterans who have emergencies dial ``911.'' Veterans who call for help are then transported to non-VA facilities. After the emergency is over, veterans are presented with huge bills. These are bills which VA cannot, in most cases, pay and which are, therefore, potentially financially crushing. We cannot abandon these veterans in their time of need. 
   Let me tell my colleagues about some of the problems that veterans face because of the restriction on emergency care. In January of this year, a low income, non-service-connected, World War II veteran with a history of heart problems, from my State of West Virginia, presented to the nearest non-VA hospital with severe chest pain. In an attempt to get the veteran admitted to the VA medical center, the private physician placed calls to the Clarksburg VA Medical Center, where the veteran was enrolled, on three separate occasions, over the course of three days. The response was always the same--``no beds available.'' 
   Ultimately, a different VA medical center, from outside the veteran's service area, accepted the patient, and two days later transferred him back to the Clarksburg VA Medical Center where he underwent an emergency surgical procedure to resolve the problem. By this time, however, complications had set in, and the veteran was critically ill. 
   The veteran's wife told me that ``no one should have to endure the pain and suffering'' they had to endure over a five-day period to get the emergency care her husband needed. But in addition to that emotional distress, the veteran now also faces a medical bill of almost $800 at the private hospital, the net amount due after Medicare paid its portion. This is an incredible burden for a veteran and his wife whose sole income are their small Social Security checks. 
   In another example from my state, in February 1998, a 100 percent service-connected veteran with post-traumatic stress disorder suffered an acute onset of mid-sternal chest pain, and an ambulance was called. The ambulance took him to the nearest hospital, a non-VA facility. Staff at the private facility contacted the Clarksburg VA Medical Center and was told there were no ICU beds available and advised transferring the patient to the Pittsburgh VA Medical Center. 
   When contacted, Pittsburgh refused the patient because of the length of necessary transport. A call to the Beckley VAMC was also fruitless. The doctor was advised by VA staff that the trip to Beckley would be ``too risky for the three hour ambulance travel.'' 
   The veteran was kept overnight at the private hospital for observation, and then was billed for the care--$900, after Medicare paid its share. 
   Two more West Virginia cases quickly come to mind involving 100 percent service-connected combat veterans, both of whom had to turn to the private sector in emergency situations. 
   One veteran had a heart attack and as I recall, his heart stopped twice before the ambulance got him to the closest non-VA hospital. The Huntington VA Medical Center was his health care provider and it was more than an hour away from the veteran's home. This veteran had Medicare, but he was still left with a sizeable medical bill for the emergency services that saved his life. 
   The other veteran suffered a fall that rendered him unconscious and caused considerable physical damage. He also was taken to the closest non-VA hospital--and was left with a $4,000 bill after Medicare paid its share. 
   Both contacted me to complain about the unfairness of these bills. As 100 percent service-connected veterans, they rely totally on VA for their health care. I can assure you that neither of them, nor the other two West Virginia veterans I referred to, ever expected to be in the situation in which they all  suddenly found themselves--strapped with large health care bills because they needed emergency treatment in life-threatening situations, when they were miles and miles from the nearest VA medical center. 
   Coverage of emergency care services for all veterans is supported by the consortium of veterans services organizations that authored the Independent Budget for Fiscal Year 2000--AMVETS, the Disabled American Veterans, the Paralyzed Veterans of America, and the Veterans of Foreign Wars. The concept is also included in the Administration's FY 2000 budget request for VA and the Consumer Bill of Rights, which President Clinton has directed every federal agency engaged in managing or delivering health care to adopt. 
   To quote from the Consumer Bill of Rights, ``Consumers have the right to access emergency health care services when and where the need arises. Health plans should provide payment when a consumer presents to an emergency department with acute symptoms of sufficient severity--including severe pain--such that a 'prudent layperson' could reasonably expect the absence of medical attention to result in placing their health in serious jeopardy, serious impairment to bodily functions, or serious dysfunction of any bodily organ or part.'' This ``prudent layperson'' standard is included in the Veterans' Access to Emergency Care Services Act of 1999 and is intended to protect both the veteran and the VA. 
   To my colleagues who would argue that this expansion of benefits is something which the VA cannot afford, I would say that denying veterans access to care should not be the way to balance our budget. The Budget Resolution includes an additional $1.7 billion for VA. I call on the appropriators to ensure that this funding makes its way to VA hospitals and clinics across the country. 
   Truly, approval of the Veterans' Access to Emergency Services Act of 1999 would ensure appropriate access to emergency medical services. Thus, we would be providing our nation's veterans greater continuity of care. 
   Mr. President, veterans currently have the opportunity to come to VA facilities for their care, but they lack coverage for the one of the most important health care services. I look forward to working with my colleagues on the House and Senate Committees on Veterans' Affairs to make this proposal a reality.

   Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I would like to comment today on the Emergency Steel Loan Guarantee Program which my distinguished colleague from West Virginia, Senator BYRD, worked so hard to have included in the Senate-passed Emergency Supplemental Appropriations bill. Despite his tireless efforts, the measure was stripped from the bill at the eleventh hour for reasons which are beyond me.  I take umbrage with the misleading moniker that some Members of the House Leadership have shamelessly placed upon this vital program for partisan political purposes. 
   This program, far from being a handout for any one company in my state of West Virginia or anywhere else, would provide emergency relief for more than a dozen American steel producers who have been stricken by the effects of the unprecedented surge in steel imports into the U.S. over the last year. This crisis, which has caused as many as 10,000 layoffs at steel factories across the nation and threatens as many as 100,000 more jobs, has unfairly injured the credit ratings of America's steel manufacturers by forcing them to compete with dirt cheap foreign steel, which is often being sold in the U.S. at costs below that of production. 
   If you ask me, this important crisis, without question, is appropriately classified as an ``emergency''. If you ask the steelworkers who've either been laid off or who are the next to go, I bet they say the same thing. Ask their families and communities if this is an emergency, and you'll get the same answer. The emergency is that our American steel industry is being pummeled by illegal foreign competition, and that the imports are taking a very real and devastating toll on the people who depend on steel for their livelihood. 
   The program that Senator BYRD proposed in the Senate-passed version of the Supplemental Appropriations bill would have made it possible for many of the most financially-unstable steel producers in this country to persevere until we in the Senate can take decisive and comprehensive action to address the underlying cause of our domestic steel industry's current predicament--imports. The Emergency Steel Loan Guarantee Program would have made much-needed capital available to those companies who have been the hardest hit by the import surge, and it would have done so at minimal expense to the American taxpayer. The program just made good sense, and I was extremely disappointed to hear that Members of the House Leadership insisted that it be eliminated. 
   The argument was, from what I hear, that Senator BYRD's provision was too expensive and of benefit only to Weirton Steel Corporation in West Virginia. The fact is, Mr. President, that Weirton was just one of more than a dozen companies which the Department of Commerce determined would be eligible for loans under this program. All of these distressed companies have been doing everything in their power to survive the current crisis. I know first hand the great lengths to which Weirton Steel has gone through simply to keep its head above water. In my state alone we've had nearly 1,000 layoffs as a direct result of the import surge. The Emergency Steel Loan Guarantee Program would have made it possible for companies across the nation to make upcoming debt payments which many steel producers are in jeopardy of defaulting on because of the current crisis. Moreover, the cost of the program was $140 million to leverage $1 billion in loans--that's a good investment. I deeply regret that the unwillingness of some Members of Congress to open their eyes to the plight of America's steelworkers has resulted in the loan program being removed from this vehicle. That is very bad news for the many steel companies who stood to benefit from the program. Some of them are now that much closer to joining the other four major American steel producers who have already been forced into bankruptcy by this crisis. 
   However, there remains time to reverse this mistake. I hope that the Members of Congress, who did not understand the details of how this loan program functions or the benefits that it would bestow upon a large number of steel companies across the nation, will reassess their position. We still have an opportunity to support this important program. I intend to work with Senator BYRD in moving this program on another legislative vehicle. 
   Each of my colleagues knows how strongly I believe that this body must act to address the import surge in a comprehensive way. However, I also know how vital the Emergency Steel Loan Guarantee Program is to many U.S. steel producers. It is a critically important stop-gap measure which would allow companies like Weirton steel to remain in business long enough for the United States Senate to take the tough and comprehensive action which is necessary to protect our domestic industry from unfair foreign competition. 
   Mr. President, I truly hope that we seize the opportunity to take up this measure again. Without it, steel companies in a number of different states may soon find themselves the next victims of our failure to aggressively enforce our unfair trade laws.

   Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Adoption Equality Act of 1999. I would like to thank Senator CHAFEE for his leadership on behalf of vulnerable children, including our bipartisan work on this legislation. He joins me today as an original co-sponsor of this legislation as do Senators DEWINE, COLLINS, LEVIN, LANDRIEU, MOYNIHAN, BREAUX, KERREY, DORGAN, CONRAD, INOUYE, DURBIN and TORRICELLI. Work on this legislation is based on the bipartisan work of the Senate coalition that supported the 1997 Adoption and Safe Families Act. 
   A unique bipartisan coalition formed in 1997 worked hard to forge consensus on the Adoption and Safe Families Act of 1997 (ASFA). This law, for the first time ever, establishes that a child's health and safety must be paramount when any decisions are made regarding children in the abuse and neglect system. While this law was the most sweeping and comprehensive piece of child welfare legislation passed in over a decade, more work needs to be done to truly achieve the goals promoted in the Act of safety, stability and permanence for all abused and neglected children. Senator CHAFEE and I and all of the other co-sponsors I have named committed ourselves to continuing that work and that is why we are here today. 
   Throughout the process of developing the Adoption Act we heard about the challenging circumstances facing children described as having ``special needs''. These include children who are  the most difficult to place into permanent homes, often due to their age, disability or status as part of a group of siblings needing to be placed together. I spent time learning about the special needs children in my own state of West Virginia. Prior to the passage of ASFA, there were 870 children, most with special needs, awaiting adoption in West Virginia. Today, I am proud to report that this number has been reduced to 621. The dedication of our state adoption staff, when combined with the incentives and focus on permanence provided in ASFA have successfully effected the placement of nearly a third of the waiting children. 
   One of the most significant provisions of ASFA was the assurance of ongoing health care coverage for all children with special needs who move from foster care to adoption. The Adoption Equality Act is an essential second step in this ongoing process. This important legislation will promote and increase adoptions by making all children with special needs eligible for Federal adoption subsidy. The bill is designed to ``level the playing field'' by ensuring that all children with special needs, and the loving families who adopt them, have the support they need to grow and develop. 
   Current law provides for the payment of federal adoption subsidies to families who adopt only those special needs children whose biological family would have been qualified for welfare benefits under the old 1996 AFDC standards. Federal adoption subsidy payments provide essential income support to help families finance the daily costs of raising these special children (food, clothing) and also special services (equipment, therapy, tutoring, etc.). Federal adoption subsidies are a vital link in securing adoptive homes for special needs children who by definition would not be adopted without support. 
   Under current law, a child's eligibility for these important benefits is dependent on the income of his or her biological parents even though these parents' legal rights to the child have been terminated, and these are the parents who either abused or neglected the child. This is, simply, wrong. The Adoption Equality Act will eliminate this anomaly in Federal law by making all special needs children eligible for Federal adoption subsidies. 
   First, the bill removes the requirement that an income eligibility determination be made in regard to the child's biological parents, whom the child is leaving, thereby allowing Federal adoption subsidy to be paid to all families who adopt children who meet the definition of special needs. 
   Second, the bill gives States flexibility in determining their own criteria, which may, but need not, include judicial determination, to the effect that continuation in the home would be contrary to the safety or welfare of the child, as well as their own definition of which of the children in their state are children with special needs. 
   Third, the bill requires that states re-invest the monies they save as a result of this bill back into their state child abuse and neglect programs. 
   When we talk about how to help abused and neglected children in this country, many complex questions are raised about what constitutes best policy, and how Federal tax dollars should be spent. Yet, at the heart of it all are the children who desperately want a family to call their own, and the families who want to adopt them. The lack of adequate financial resources to support these adoptions is often the only barrier that stands between an abused child and a safe, loving and permanent home. With the numbers of abused and neglected children rising dramatically--in West Virginia alone child abuse reports have doubled--from 13,000 in 1986 to over 26,000 in 1996--we need to remove every barrier in our efforts to make a difference. A West Virginia family recently told me:  
   I knew we had enough love to give a child with special needs--even siblings. But could we afford it? More children means more of everything. This obstacle was removed through the adoption subsidy program and we now have four children in our lives. Our lives have truly changed. Special needs for us was a very special way to adopt a waiting child.  
   Federal adoption subsidies are designed to encourage adoption of children with special needs--those children who have the hardest time finding permanent, adoptive families. It is an absurd policy to discriminate against thousands of children with special needs based upon the income of their biological (and often abusive) parents. It is time to create a Federal policy that levels the playing field and gives all children with special needs an equal and fair chance at being adopted. 
   I am confident that the Adoption Equality Act will do just that, and at the same time, with the re-investment requirement, states should have the incentive to make additional improvements in their child welfare systems. These will be valuable steps in our efforts to be more able to effectively address the needs of our Nation's most vulnerable children. I urge my colleagues join us in co-sponsoring and passing this bill.

   Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I am proud to introduce today with my colleagues Senators HATCH, CRAPO, and BRYAN the Alternative Fuels Promotion Act. This is an important bipartisan piece of legislation providing tax incentives to help stimulate the still fledgling alternative fuel vehicle industry. It creates a $0.50 per gasoline equivalent gallon tax credit for natural gas, methanol, propane and hydrogen, thus almost leveling the tax treatment for all alternative fuels. The bill also contains provisions for extending the electric vehicle tax credit and augmenting it to encourage advanced technology vehicles. It also expands the existing tax deduction for alternative fuel fueling infrastructure to include the cost of installation. Finally, the bill gives states the authority to allow single occupant alternative fueled vehicles on high occupancy vehicle (HOV) lanes. 
   I introduce this bill today because I believe that it is time for the next automobile revolution. 
   I say revolution because as Webster's tells us, the word can mean ``a fundamental change in the way of thinking about something.'' 
   One compelling argument for pursuing fundamental change when it comes to automobiles is the fact that we still need to reduce this nation's dependence on imported oil, for obvious reasons. After all, Saddam Hussein didn't invade Kuwait to increase his supply of sand. We are at an historic high in our dependence on imported oil. Currently, we import approximately one half of the oil consumed in this nation. According to the Energy Information Administration, that level is expected to increase to more than sixty percent within the next decade, unless we do something dramatic to reverse the current trend. Even more foreboding is the fact that most of the oil we import is from the Middle East. It makes no sense for us to stand idly by as this volatile region of the world increases its potential stranglehold over the world's economy. 
   It is also critical that we reduce the transportation sector's negative impact on air quality. We are in the midst of an alarming increase in reported asthma and other respiratory diseases. This problem is esepcially acute among children and senior citizens. While the automobile industry has made great strides in reducing emissions from cars and trucks, the improvement has been largely offset by the dramatically increasing number of cars, sport utility vehicles and trucks on the road and the increasing number of miles these vehicles are driven each year. Clearly, doing something to cut air pollution and reduce greenhouse gas emissions, for example, requires enormous change in transportation. 
   The options for bringing about change in the transportation sector are limited. We can pursue punitive new taxes, mandates, or regulations. This approach, I believe, would result in job losses and economic stagnation, situations that are not acceptable to either the American people or the Congress. I believe the best way to bring about the change we need is to provide incentives--to manufacturers to develop and sell clean technology--and to consumers to buy 
   and use that technology. 
   The domestic automobile manufacturers have been developing a full menu of clean, efficient vehicles for the 21st century. And unlike before, these vehicles are much closer to their gasoline-powered counterparts in terms of performance, safety, comfort, and cost. Just recently, two of our biggest automobile manufacturers unveiled their latest fuel-cell-powered vehicles--the alternative fuel vehicle considered by many to be the car of the 21st century. Much of the technology incorporated into such advanced transportation technologies--hybrids, electric vehicles with advanced batteries, fuel cell vehicles as well as bi-fuel and flex-fuel vehicles--are a direct result of the work government and industry have done together, in full partnership, through programs like the United States Advanced Battery Consortium and the Partnership for a New Generation of Vehicles. 
   Perhaps most exciting is that some of these ``cars of the future'' are available today. Electric vehicles are being sold, albeit in small numbers, to fleets nationwide, and to select target markets in California and Arizona. Also, most major automakers have alternative fuel vehicles available for either fleet or private purchase. 
   And there is encouraging news on the infrastructure front as well. Alternative fuel providers and electric utilities throughout the country are putting the infrastructure in place to support alternative fuel and electric vehicles in operation. By the end of 1998, nearly 300 public charging sites with more than 600 chargers, as well as hundreds of home chargers, and a number of fleet installations, were established throughout California and Arizona. We need more of this to happen nationally. There are also more than 110 methanol stations nationwide supporting alternative and flex fuel vehicles. Also, compressed natural gas and other natural gas-based fuels are developing infrastructure as well. For example, in my state of West Virginia alone there are over 40 compressed natural gas fueling stations. 
   I think this is all evidence that we have indeed initiated an automotive revolution. Unfortunately, the market hasn't developed as quickly as we thought it would when we passed the Energy Policy Act of 1992 with such high hopes. And perhaps we were too optimistic about what would be required by both government and industry to build a sustainable market for the technology. 
   So, what can we do to speed things up? How can we make sure there are more vehicles available, get more people to buy them, and develop the infrastructure to sustain them? 
   First, as I mentioned earlier, the alternative fuel and electric vehicle markets started more slowly than I think many of us expected. Therefore, we need to extend the phase-out dates of current tax credits. This would continue to help us ``jumpstart'' the market for electric vehicles, and lay out a longer-term incentive policy. Also, I feel that hard work and progress should be encouraged. Electric vehicles with extended range capability are the result of additional investments in research and technology. This behavior needs to be rewarded. 
   Second, there needs to be more support for the development of an effective alternative fuel fueling infrastructure. For too long, we been caught in a `chicken and egg' cycle, with the 
   infrastructure not available to support alternative fuel vehicles, and consumers not interested in the vehicles because there's not support infrastructure. We need to break this cycle by creating better tax incentives to help develop alternative fuel infrastructure. The current tax deductions for capitol equipment is not sufficient since a large portion of the overall cost may be associated with the actual cost of installation. 
   Finally, we must make alternative fuels, like natural gas, methanol, propane and hydrogen, economically attractive to producers, distributors,  marketers and buyers. If consumers see affordable new fuels available at their local fueling stations, they will be much more likely to actually use an alternative fuel vehicle. Tax incentives have traditionally been very effective in encouraging consumers to try new technology. While changing consumer's behavior is not easy, I am confident that if people begin to see that alternative fuels are available and affordable, they will soon begin to use them. Without the economic drive at every link in the fuel chain any alternative fuel effort will not succeed. 
   This is why today I along with my colleagues are introducing the Alternative Fuels Promotion Act. 
   This bill contains provisions for extending the $4,000 tax credit for electric vehicles until 2010. It also grants an additional $5,000 tax credit for electric vehicles that meet a 100 mile range requirement. These provisions will help electric vehicle commercialization and research to move forward at a faster pace, and will mean that more people will be able to buy electric vehicles. 
   However, few people will buy electric vehicles and other alternatively fueled vehicles if there is nowhere to refuel them. I want to encourage the development of these stations. Therefore, my bill expands the current tax deduction for alternative fuel fueling capital equipment to include the cost of installation. This will allow more infrastructure for electric and alternative fuel vehicles to be installed and used. 
   The Alternative Fuels Promotion Act also makes clean-burning alternative fuels economically attractive. The bill provides a $0.50 per gasoline equivalent gallon tax credit to the seller of compressed natural gas, liquefied natural gas, methanol, propane or hydrogen. This will allow these non-petroleum fuels to become more economically favorable to the consumer through lower prices at the pump. It also places these fuels on tax parity with other alternatives. By giving the tax credit to the seller of the fuel, it reduces the paperwork burden on the individual consumer, and allows for easier dispersal of the credit throughout the production/delivery/marketing chain so that all parties are interested in increasing the consumption of alternative fuels. 
   Finally, the Alternative Fuel Promotion Act gives states the ability to decide if they want to allow single occupant alternative fuel and electric vehicles in HOV lanes. This is, I feel, a strong incentive that states should be allowed, but not required, to give to owners of these special vehicles.

    Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I would like to share with my colleagues a very special occasion for education. I proudly want to share in the celebration as Oglebay Institute announces its new and sophisticated 11,700-square foot Schrader Environmental Educational Center in Wheeling, West Virginia. The incredible opportunities that will be offered by this state-of-the-art facility characterize the Oglebay Institute's dedication to educating students and adults about science, nature, and the environment. 
   The Oglebay Institute in Wheeling, West Virginia is a non-profit organization with a particularly distinguished mission of promoting lifelong learning in a variety of creative ways and areas. The Institute lends its support to the visual and creative arts, sponsoring regional and national artists in two museums as well as a fine arts center. By hosting numerous plays and concerts every year, the Oglebay performing arts department is equally important in adding to the cultural richness of the surrounding community. To promote regional natural history interpretation and preservation, the Institute carefully maintains 4.5 miles of discovery trails and a butterfly and wildflower garden in the 1,650 acre Oglebay Park. Such resources are well utilized in programs for regional wildlife education. The opportunities available range from nature walks to bird observation, and travel programs to celebrations of Earth Week. The environmental education department, whose accomplishments we honor today, caters to a wealth of individual interests while promoting universal environmental literacy and motivation. Particularly noteworthy in such endeavors are the hands-on experiences with various aspects of nature. In the program offerings such options abound; participants choose from among astronomy, maple sugaring and interactive computer simulations. 
   For sixty-eight years, the Oglebay Institute has been a pioneer in this field of nature, science and environmental education, successfully coupling recreation with the promotion of environmental awareness. The new Environmental Education Center, with its exceptional design and ideal location, insures a great contribution to this vision. The Schrader Center's exhibition areas will offer interactive opportunities exploring all issues, ranging from the self-supporting nature of the Earth to our role as its caretakers. At the newly constructed cutting edge learning center, outreach technology will enable adaption of educational programs to extend education to local students and others thanks to distance learning. I have full confidence that the proximity of the Environmental Education Center to the expansive Oglebay Park, where many outdoor activities take place, will serve as further incentive to enjoy the remarkable opportunities available. 
   West Virginians and tourists from across the country visit Oglebay Park and learn from the Oglebay Institute. For seven decades, the Oglebay Institute has provided education, culture, and recreational activities for crowds  throughout the region. Among the eager participants are school groups who can gain hands-on experience at the new center. 
   The Oglebay Institute's efforts to educate and fully engage are critical to an environmentally-conscious future, and worthy of our attention and praise. The Schrader Environmental Education Center will undoubtedly prove to be an enormous asset to West Virginians and the entire region as a way to improve our understanding of science and our nature. This is a special day for the Oglebay Institute and the entire Wheeling area.

   Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I am pleased to be introducing the ``Access to Rx Medications in Medicare Act of 1999'' with my colleague from Massachusetts, Senator KENNEDY. Our legislation seeks to assist Medicare beneficiaries with their single largest out-of-pocket expense for health care services--prescription drugs. 
   I would like to thank Senator KENNEDY for his leadership in bringing this issue to the forefront of the health care debate. I have long admired Senator KENNEDY's commitment and dedication to improving the lives of our most vulnerable citizens. 
   This is not the first time prescription coverage has been discussed seriously in the United States Senate. The debate around providing prescription drug coverage was first discussed while the creation of the Medicare program was being considered. Unfortunately, in the end, drug coverage was not included. 
   Medicare has not been updated substantially since its enactment and we know that a lot has changed in health care since 1965. The program was modeled after employer-sponsored health plans--most of which, at the time, did not offer prescription drug coverage. Now, almost all employer-sponsored health plans recognize the important role that prescription drugs play in modern medicine. Additionally, the value of drug therapy was unclear in 1965. Today, medical and technological advances in drug safety and effectiveness have created more pharmaceutical products that can treat disease and manage chronic illnesses. 
   A decade ago, the Senate sought to redress that error and provide prescription drug coverage to all--but politics overwhelmed a much-needed policy change and the benefit was forfeited. I believe it is time to reenergize the debate. 
   Today, we have the opportunity to build on successful private sector initiatives to provide Medicare beneficiaries with much needed prescription drug coverage. Pharmaceutical benefit managers (PBMs) have the information infrastructure, claims experience, and detailed understanding of drug management to provide a strong, stable benefit structure. By taking advantage of their management skills, we can update the Medicare program, make it stronger, make it more competitive, and more able to meet the challenges presented by the approaching retirement of the baby boom generation. 
   Mr. President, I am constantly in touch with West Virginians who describe the dilemmas they face about paying for the prescription drugs. These are people who have worked hard all their lives, raised families, contributed to their communities, and paid their taxes. Now, in the twilight of their lives, a time that they should be enjoying with their children and grandchildren, they are struggling to make ends meet. And health care expenses, especially prescription drug costs, are breaking their budgets.

   Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill that would establish the authority to provide a duty drawback on imports of two commercially interchangeable rubber vulcanization accelerators known commonly as CBS and TBBS. 
   CBS and TBBS are the major primary accelerators used in the production of tires and other rubber products. Both CBS and TBBS belong to the same class and subclass of rubber vulcanization chemicals, and can be used interchangeably with one another to perform the same function and to achieve the same end results. They can be manufactured by similar industrial processes using the same raw materials and identical process steps; and for all practical purposes, it is not possible to tell if CBS or TBBS were used in the final rubber product. In short, the two chemicals are commercially interchangeable in both function and use, and therefore, I believe they meet the specified circumstances required under Section 202 of U.S. trade law to receive duty drawback benefits based on a substitution basis. 
   More specifically, this bill is extremely important to a West Virginia company, Flexsys, that produces both CBS and TBBS, and employs 230 West Virginians with an average annual salary of $42,000. Passage of this bill will preserve these jobs in an increasingly competitive chemical market, and will permit American-made products to compete more effectively in world markets. 
   Because of the competitive nature of the chemical business, American companies must constantly look for new opportunities to improve efficiency, strengthen U.S. operations and cost position, and provide benefits to their customers. I believe the Congress had these goals in mind when we passed the duty drawback provisions in the Customs Modification Act of 1993. Flexsys meets the conditions set forth under the duty drawback provision that two products must be ``commercially interchangeable'' to claim a drawback credit, and I urge my colleagues to adopt this bill.

   Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, today I am with my colleague Senate FRIST introducing the Technology Transfer Commercialization Act of 1999. This bill would make technical changes and clarifications to the legislation which governs the transfer of intellectual property from the federal government to the private sector. 
   The original Technology Transfer Improvements Act (TTIA), which I was author of in 1995, allowed for easier and quicker access to intellectual property which the government owns and private industry wants. It created a win-win situation. The government gets royalties from these licenses, private industry gets the intellectual property that it needs, and Americans get jobs from the production of inventions based on this intellectual property. 
   This bill builds on the strong positive response from TTIA. It reduces the requirements for obtaining a non-exclusive license in order to allow as many companies and individuals as possible access to the information. It also addresses private industry's concerns about maintaining confidential information within applications. 
   However, this does not come at the expense of the government being able to keep control of its property. This bill also clarifies the ability of the licensing agencies to terminate a license if certain criteria are not met. Furthermore, it allows the government to consolidate intellectual property which is developed in cooperation with a private entity so that the package can be relicensed to a third party. 
   Technology transfer is a vital part of our national economy. It is what allows our industries to remain at the leading edge in their field. This bill clarifies and adjusts current legislation to allow for an even better working relationship between the federal government and private industry. I encourage my colleagues to support this bill.

   Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I am pleased to be introducing the ``Medicare Cancer Clinical Trials Coverage Act of 1999'' with my colleague from Florida, Senator MACK. This legislation would establish a demonstration project to assure Medicare beneficiaries with cancer that Medicare will cover their routine patient costs when part of a clinical trial. 
   I would like to thank Senator MACK for his leadership and dedication on this issue. It has been a pleasure to work with Senator MACK, a tireless champion for cancer patients throughout his years of service in the Senate. 
   With 1,500 deaths due to cancer each day and 1.3 million new cancer diagnoses this year, there is a clear and urgent need for this legislation. Our senior population is especially at risk--Medicare beneficiaries make up half of all cancer diagnoses and 60% of all cancer deaths. Yet, Medicare's policy toward covering quality cancer care is ambiguous and its enforcement practices are unpredictable. 
   Our legislation represents a significant step forward in the fight to prevent, detect and treat cancer quickly and effectively. It is based on a very simple premise: given the disproportionate impact that cancer has on older Americans, Medicare should be responsible for the routine patient care costs associated with approved clinical trials. 
   Cancer clinical trials often represent a cancer patient's best hope for survival, especially when their cancer fails to respond to traditional therapies. Yet, under current law, Medicare beneficiaries can be denied coverage for the routine patient care costs associated with clinical trials. However, if the same care is provided outside of a clinical trial setting, it is covered by Medicare. 
   It is a tragedy that the costs of participating in a clinical trial are discouraging patients from using what might be their best weapon in a battle with cancer. Medicare beneficiaries who are cancer patients are left with only two choices: pay the costs out of their own pocket, or forgo treatment all together. It is unfair, and unconscionable, that we force cancer patient to make this decision. 
   There are other compelling reasons to cover these costs. By paying for these routine costs, we provide incentives for researchers to include more Medicare beneficiaries in cancer clinical trials. Researchers know that patients who are at different stages physically, mentally, and emotionally will react very differently to treatments--even if they are fighting the same cancer. But what they don't know is how age and health interact with the safety and effectiveness of new drugs and treatments. Our bill helps them find the answers to those critical questions. 
   Our bill saves money in the long-run by ensuring the Medicare program pays for treatments that work. Clinical studies can determine which interventions work the best, and when they are the most effective. 
   Finally, in establishing a demonstration project, this bill will also provide valuable information about the costs and benefits of providing coverage for clinical trials for other life-threatening diseases. We started with cancer first because cancer is a major affliction of Medicare beneficiaries. In addition there is a well-established national clinical cancer trial system to deliver this patient care. 
   Mr. President, our legislation does not create a new benefit. It merely ensures that patients enrolled in clinical studies receive Medicare coverage for the same type of routine patient care costs, such as hospital and physician fees, that would be covered outside of a trial setting. We are not asking Medicare to pay for the cost of research. These expenses will still be covered by trial sponsors, including pharmaceutical companies. 
   The ``Medicare Cancer Clinical Trials Coverage Act'' is a modest proposal, but it has the potential to become a new weapon in the fight against cancer. But we must act now. We have fought for this proposal in previous sessions of Congress, and I believe the momentum is building to get the legislation passed this year. I look forward to working with Senator MACK and others to take an important step forward for cancer patients.

   Mr. ROCKEFELLER. The Senator from West Virginia would like to have 10 minutes. 
</TEXT>
</DOC>

<DOCNO>106-rockefeller-wv-2-19990325</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I thank the Senator from New Mexico. I understand the point of the Senator. I thank the Senator from Massachusetts and the Senator from North Dakota. 
   This particular Senator from West Virginia was a member of the Medicare Commission and I know, undoubtedly, several have spoken. But whatever amendments may be remaining, there cannot be many as important as the disposition of Medicare. Medicare is something that is not that well understood even though everybody knows what it is, and therefore it is subject to easy amendments and easy resolutions, and facts are entirely often lost. 
   There is, I understand, a resolution or whatever praising the Medicaid Commission for its bipartisan efforts  and the rest of it. Those of us who were on that Commission know that isn't and wasn't the case. It was not a bipartisan Commission; it was a Commission that was divided from the very beginning. 
   It was a Commission in which there was really no give and take. Just so my colleagues can understand, the plan, which was being changed every 5 minutes, as certain Members sought to get votes here and there, was not even finally given to my office until 4 o'clock the day before the vote. I was in West Virginia so I didn't see the plan until an hour before the vote. It was really kind of a shambles of an operation. 
   But that isn't nearly as important as the fact that beneficiaries pay more under this plan for the same or fewer benefits. It isn't nearly as important as the fact that the sick and the disabled were probably going to have to pay the most. The fact that this plan contemplates and its authors contemplate the numbers of years that 50 to 75 percent of all Medicare beneficiaries will belong to HMOs--of course, I don't believe that is ever going to happen. They do it, and it is reflected in their plan. 
   Just imagine for a moment what that would mean, because HMOs would naturally attract the most wealthy and the most healthy. So what would that mean for the people in my State who are left in fee-for-service medicine? Fee-for-service would be a very small pot of money which would have to cover an enormous amount of people. 
   The philosophy of the Medicare Commission fundamentally was that free enterprise can solve the problems of Medicare, and that is why they said 50 to 75 percent will join HMOs over the next 15 to 20 years. Of course, free enterprise had its chance to work with respect to people over 65 and did it so badly, that is the reason we created Medicare, in order not to leave it up to the market system in its entirety and to make sure that every senior had health care coverage. 
   There was a lot of ideology involved in the Commission. There were a lot of people there primarily because of an ideological commitment, a commitment that was there from the very beginning. It was very obvious. There never really was any discussion of issues. There were speeches, but not much discussion. Seniors, I think, had very little idea of what was in the plan. 
   Those who remember catastrophic health care--if Congress puts forward a plan and doesn't consult seniors and seniors aren't knowledgeable about it, you can have it thrown right back in your face. Medicare is not something you can fool around with. 
   Speaking for my own point of view, representing the State of West Virginia, the average senior in West Virginia has a total gross income from all sources, of $10,763. Then, from that amount you subtract $2,000 to pay for their Medigap or their out-of-pocket expenses for health care which they can't get from Medicare, primarily prescription drugs. That means the average senior in the State has a gross income for a year of about $8,500. 
   I will guarantee you, this Senator isn't fooling around with chances on Medicare. There is no way that I am taking a chance on Medicare, that I am betting on something that did not work prior to 1965, that suddenly people say will work after this Medicare Commission presented its plan which did not pass and which was basically defeated on a partisan vote, which was very, very sad. It was fated from the beginning, and it was very, very sad. 
   I have chaired four national commissions. This was the fifth one I have been on. It was probably the worst experience 
   I have had since I have been in the Senate. I say that with regret, because I care enormously about health care, and I care enormously about the people who ran the Commission. I thought they tried their very best, but it was fated to fail from the very beginning because of the ideological bent that it carried with it. I think a measure here to praise it is totally out of place. 
   I mentioned prescription drugs. Everybody understands that when the President was wise enough to put aside 15 percent to pay down the debt so the money would become available because of the lack of higher interest payments for Medicare, that that was a very wise thing to do. That also allows us to contemplate prescription drugs. The Medicare Commission wouldn't even consider the use of that 15 percent. They wouldn't consider it. As a result, prescription drugs are not uniformly available. 
   Some seniors already have prescription drugs. They get it through Medigap. This would say, well, you would have to be up to 135 percent of poverty, but that just came in in the last week or so. That would disappear, I think, on the floor of the Senate, because I do not think, frankly, that the majority would want to see prescription drugs, because they would say it would cost too much. Well, they might be right. I think they are wrong. Seniors are now paying for it. 
   Under this plan, they purport that prescription drugs are covered, but they are, indeed, not covered. Many beneficiaries would not have it. They talk about prescription drugs for low-income beneficiaries, but most would not have them. 
   On one of the most extraordinary things that I think would very much affect the senior Senator from New Mexico, they punt. They don't even punt. They kick at the ball and miss it on the subject of graduate medical education. We do not have doctors in this country by accident. We have doctors in this country because their residencies and their postgraduate experiences are paid for, 50 percent by Medicare. Some people may not think that it should come out of Medicare, but if it doesn't come out of Medicare, then it should come out of some designated fund, an au pair trust fund or something of that sort. 
   What is incredible about the Medicare Commission is that it simply says, we will leave graduate medical education or direct medical education up to the appropriations process, which is like saying goodbye to all foreign doctors, which are as important in New York City as they are in southern West Virginia, because foreign doctors are well trained and they get further training in their own country. 
   Fifty percent of their expense is being paid for by Medicare. Under the appropriations process, they would disappear. So will many others. So will many others, because there will be no constant way of funding a very obscure program called Graduate Medical Education, which is the heart and soul of the training of good doctors and, therefore, good health care in our country. 
   The Federal savings in this matter--and I won't talk on forever here--but the Federal savings in this are generally a sham. I think only about $95 to $96 billion out of the $346 billion or $347 billion that the Commission says they are saving actually comes out of what they call premium supports. All the rest comes out of cutting benefits, out of the Balanced Budget Act, which we passed in 1997, out of a whole series of other things, cutting doctors and hospitals, once again. The savings are made at the expense of the beneficiary, at the expense of 
   good health care. I have very, very strong feelings. 
   Just consider for one instance that 71 percent of the counties in this country have no medical plan, no HMO whatsoever. I represent a whole State. We have one. So where is the choice? There is no choice.

   Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I will use my minute in response to simply say this is not a ``bipartisan'' Commission. The Finance Committee may very well take it up. But people, before they praise what the Bipartisan Commission has done, should understand the sick and disabled are going to have to pay 
   the most. Mr. President, 71 percent of all counties in this country have no HMOs whatsoever. The costs of beneficiaries are going to go up. Medicare prescription drugs are not in any way, shape, or form universal.

   Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I will continue by saying rural seniors and urban seniors are going to be hurt in this process because there will be fewer physicians who are trained because the training of doctors is completely removed from Medicare. It was turned over to the appropriators. I think you will see a diminution of personnel. 
   The numbers of uninsured seniors are going to be increased, some estimate by 1.4 million. Medicare was begun because the private sector was not able to handle the insurance, was not willing to handle it. I hope Members will vote against this nonbipartisan Commission.

   Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, as the Ranking Member of the Committee on Veterans' Affairs, I would like to comment on S. Con. Res. 20, the Concurrent Resolution on the FY 2000 Budget. Specifically, I will address the funding allowances for Function 700--Veterans Benefits and Services. 
   At the outset, let me note that this budget resolution is a departure from past budget resolutions which have cut veterans' spending. The resolution emanating from the Senate Budget Committee includes total spending for an additional $0.9 billion in new budget authority and $1.1 billion in outlays for FY 2000. I am grateful for this increase. It is a valid attempt to infuse the VA with badly needed resources. However, the spending needs of the Veterans Health Administration exceed this recommended level. I believe we can and should do better. 
   The VA health care system is being squeezed by lack of funding. It's high time that we realized that if this track continues, we will see the closure of VA hospitals. Many VA hospitals are already on the brink; another year of no-growth budgets will close hospitals. Small rural hospitals in New York State and Arizona will be closed. Large urban hospitals, like the ones in Illinois and California, will not be immune and will be shut down. 
   Various estimates exist about what amount VA would need to simply maintain the level of current services. Conservatively, we are talking about an increase of $850 million to cover payroll inflation, increases in the costs of goods, and other increases beyond the control of VA. So despite VA's efforts to mitigate the increasing cost of pharmaceuticals, for example--efforts which have been lauded by others as the model for Medicare to follow--VA must budget for $850 million just to maintain current services. The concurrent budget resolution before us today fully addresses these uncontrollable costs. It does not, however, make allowances for increased growth of any kind. 
   In our Committee Views and Estimates, Chairman SPECTER and I outlined the costs associated with unanticipated VA spending requirements, as well as those costs linked to unmet needs. I refer my colleagues to Committee on Veterans' Affairs Views and Estimates for a more complete listing of these substantial costs. However, I do want to highlight some of these areas. 
   Caring for veterans with the Hepatitis C virus is certainly one of those unanticipated spending requirements. VA studies now indicate that at least 20 percent of hospitalized veteran-patients test positive for the virus. This is twice the rate reported in the general population. VA anticipates that to fully screen and treat these patients, $625 million will be necessary in FY 2000. 
   A second priority is to provide veterans with access to the same health care services as other Americans. VA cannot now provide emergency care services to all veterans. Many veterans have gone to community emergency rooms believing that VA would reimburse them. Of course, in most cases, VA would not and they were left with substantial medical bills. Providing emergency care and the subsequent hospital admission to veterans would cost the VA $548 million in FY 2000. 
   Third, a funding need which should not be overlooked is long-term care. We know that the percent of veterans over the age of 65 years will grow from 35 percent of the total veteran population to approximately 42 percent of the total population over the next ten years. Does VA have the necessary resources to care for this influx of aging veterans? Under the current financial construct, the answer is a resounding ``no.'' A funding increase of at least $1 billion is required to meet this unmet need. 
   It should come as no surprise to my colleagues that the financial constraints that have been placed upon the VA are also having a negative effect on the health care provided to our veterans. 
   Through our oversight efforts on the Committee on Veterans' Affairs, we have documented serious problems with quality which are the result of staffing shortages. The increase of dangerous pressure ulcer sores in VA nursing homes is only one example of deteriorating inpatient care. A recent report issued by the VA Medical Inspector's office clearly states that at the DC Medical Center, ``bedside patient care, such as turning patients at frequent intervals to prevent pressure ulcers, was affected by the shortage of staff.'' These staffing shortages exist at medical centers all across the country. 
   With regard to outpatient treatment, the trend points to a disturbing lack of access. VA is rightly moving more patients into ambulatory care settings; however, the system as it is currently funded cannot handle the increased workload. 
   In some cases, waiting times for routine clinic appointments--like cardiology and gastroenterology--reach 100 days or longer. Mental health services are simply unavailable at 60 percent of VA's outpatient clinics. Finally, while other health care providers and payers are seeing increased per patient costs, the VA must live within forecasts which assume a drop in per patient expenditures. This cannot continue without drastically impacting quality. 
   I think many of my colleagues would also be disturbed to learn that VA's specialized health care services--blind rehabilitation, traumatic brain injury care, post traumatic stress disorder services, spinal cord injury care, and mental health services--have buckled under the strain. We have spent a tremendous amount of time visiting hospitals and looking deeply into these mandated programs. We have seen budgets for VA PTSD services in Ohio and New York cut at the expense of services. We have found VA substance abuse programs in Delaware, Alabama, New Jersey, and Ohio virtually decimated. 
   In my home State of West Virginia, we have four small, rural VA medical centers. And I can tell you that simply covering the cost of current services won't help much. In fact, the continued financial stress of the VA budget will  have devastating effects on services and veterans at each of these VA hospitals in my State. 
   In one hospital alone we could be faced with the elimination of audiology and speech pathology, the reduction of dental services, the complete closures of the inpatient surgery, outpatient surgery, and the outpatient mental health programs. 
   I believe that West Virginia veterans, and veterans across the country, deserve quality health care--and I, for one, will not allow these reductions and program closures. 
   And I can assure you, my friends, that if these situations exist in the small VA hospitals in my state of West Virginia, then they exist in other VA hospitals--whether they are small rural VA hospitals or large urban VA hospitals. 
   Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to comment on another aspect of the VA budget. On the benefits side, I was very pleased to see the President request and the Budget Committee accept the increase of $49 million in the General Operating Expenses account to provide for an increase of 164 FTE in FY 2000. These new 164 FTE will join FTE shifted over from other duties to provide an additional 440 adjudication FTE. 
   The Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA) has experienced an increase in pending compensation and pension workload of close to 50,000 cases per year, over the last two years. This is a reversal of the downward trend from FY 92-96. The age of those cases is also growing, with an average in FY 98 of 168 days to process original compensation claims, resulting in 33 percent of cases pending over six months, up from 26 percent in FY 97. This increase in the backlog is in spite of a small decrease in the number of claims being filed. VBA also has real problems with the quality of their decision making. Their own review (STAR) revealed an error rate of 36 percent. 
   VBA is taking measures to address its quality and workload problems, but they need more resources to deal with some of their biggest challenges, such as: the loss of their most experienced decision makers as they become retirement eligible; the lack of training and the lack of uniformity of that training; the struggle to improve customer service through case management and the reduction of blocked call rates. 
   It is critical that VBA not only improve their quality and timeliness, but also ensure the integrity of the measures of those factors. They must require accountability in the effort or failure to achieve those goals. These are things that VBA has not been particularly motivated or driven to do in the past. I look to VBA to strive for data integrity and accountability and hope that additional staffing resources will aid in these efforts. 
   In conclusion, Mr. President, we must do more to restore quality and access to health care for America's veterans today and those service members who will be veterans tomorrow.

The amendment that I am offering, together with Senator KENNEDY, creates a credible reserve fund to accommodate such if a bill which reforms Medicare, in fact, passes. This will not add to the debt. There are no unacceptable conditions. There is no uncertainty about whether the funds will be there. The idea is clear and simple, and I urge my colleagues to vote for the amendment.

    Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I rise to comment on the issue of international satellite reform. First I want to thank Senator BURNS for holding this important hearing. International satellite reform is critical to consumers across the United States. 
   Yesterday I agreed to become a cosponsor of this bill--along with Senators BURNS, MCCAIN, BRYAN, BROWNBACK, CLELAND, FRIST and DORGAN. I support Senator BURNS' bill because I believe that it is in the consumer interest to have a private INTELSAT. Such a competitive entity will lead to lower prices, better service, and more efficiency across the globe. 
   Additionally, removing ownership restrictions on COMSAT will help to bring new services to American consumers. I believe that broadband satellite services will play a very important role in West Virginia's future, and this bill will lead to further deployment of these services by lifting the ownership restriction on COMSAT. I am excited by the possibility of a new competitor in domestic satellite services, and the resulting advances in these satellite services. Our mountainous terrain and the high cost of providing traditional telecommunications services make satellite services particularly important to West Virginia. 
   Furthermore, INTELSAT has a history of serving all parts of the world at reasonable prices. We have an interest in making sure that developing nations are part of the global information infrastructure. I will work to make sure that this bill will allow a privatized INTELSAT to continue to serve these areas at reasonable prices. 
   I must state, however, that while I support this bill, we are still in the middle of the legislative process. I am eager to continue working with Senators HOLLINGS, BREAUX, and other Senators who are working on important ideas with great promise. I want to stress that while I agree that this bill is the right platform for international satellite reform, I intend to keep working hard on this issue.

    Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I rise today to join Mr. DEWINE in his introduction of the Strengthening Abuse and Neglect Courts Act. I would like to thank Mr. DEWINE for his leadership on behalf of vulnerable children, including our bipartisan work on this legislation. Work on this legislation is based on the bipartisan work of the Senate coalition that supported the 1997 Adoption and Safe Families Act. 
   A unique bipartisan coalition formed in 1997 worked hard to forge consensus on the Adoption and Safe Families Act of 1997. This law, for the first time ever, establishes that a child's health and safety must be paramount when any decisions are made regarding children in the abuse and neglect system. The law was the most sweeping and comprehensive piece of child welfare legislation passed in over a decade. It promotes safety, stability and permanence for all abused and neglected children and requires timely decision-making in all proceedings to determine whether children can safely return home, or whether they should be moved to permanent, adoptive homes. More specifically, the law requires a State to move to terminate the parental rights of any parent whose child has been in foster care for 15 out of the last 22 months.  
   Throughout the process of developing the Adoption Act we heard about the vital role the Nation's abuse and neglect courts play in achieving the goals of safety and permanence for children. We also heard that these courts were seriously overburdened and challenged by insufficient resources. Now, nearly a year and a half after the passage of the law, courts are struggling to meet the guidelines. Judges and child welfare professionals in my state of West Virginia tell me that the law is helping move children through the system more quickly, that the accelerated timelines are, indeed, essential for the protection of children, and that the effect of this is that the courts are becoming even more overburdened. We are hearing this same type of feedback from other judges and child advocates around the country. 
   These courts--and the judges, lawyers and other court personnel--make some of the most difficult and important decisions made by any members of the judiciary. Adjudications of abuse and neglect, terminations of parental rights, approval of adoptions, and life-changing determinations require the appropriate level of information, thoughtfulness and care. Judges throughout the country, like West Virginia's Chief Justice Margaret Workman, are committed to the fair and efficient administration of justice in these cases. In 1987, just over 2 million children, nationally, were reported or neglected. By 1997, this number had swelled to 
   well over 3 million children. During this period, my own state of West Virginia experienced a 100% increase in child abuse cases. These staggering increases in child abuse have placed an unconscionable burden on these courts. 
   Working within their own communities, judges, attorneys, volunteers from the Court Appointed Special Advocates (CASA) programs and others have found creative and effective new ways to eliminate their caseload backlogs and move children more efficiently and safely through the court system. In West Virginia, Judge Workman and others have developed a comprehensive plan to increase the accountability and efficient administration of abuse and neglect cases. In Cincinatti, Ohio, Judge Grossman's abuse and neglect courts have implemented state-of-the-art computer tracking systems which help them smooth the legal paths of children in foster care. 
   Even when courts have the dedication and initiative to implement these innovative reforms, they simply cannot do it without sufficient resources. The purpose of the Strengthening Abuse and Neglect Courts Act is to help remove the burdens on an ever greater number of courts by increasing both their efficiency and their effectiveness. The bill provides much needed resources and allows state and local communities the flexibility to develop their own solutions to administrative problems and caseload backlogs. In January of this year, the General Accounting Office released a report conducted at the request of Ways and Means Subcommittee on Human Resources Chairman SHAW, which concluded that there are three essential ingredients for successful court reform, all of which are incorporated in this Act. There are four ways this bill will help abuse and neglect courts better serve children and families. 
   The bill first provides a program of grants to states and local courts for the implementation of computerized case-tracking systems, similar to the one Judge Grossman created in Ohio. Through the establishment of such systems, courts are able to more easily track how long a child spends in foster care and the status of their cases. When courts have such ``user-friendly'' access to vital case information children truly benefit--they move more quickly through foster care and on to adoptive homes or other permanent placements. This grant program will enable state and local courts to design similar computer systems, to replicate models that have proven successful in other jurisdictions and to receive technical assistance as they implement their new programs. 
   A second important provision of the bill is the grant program that provides State and local courts the resources they need to eliminate the backlog of abuse and neglect cases. Throughout the discussions on the Adoption and Safe Families Act, we heard from dozens of judges and advocates who said that far and away the biggest problem facing their courts was the overwhelming backlog of these cases. Without creative ways to eliminate these backlogs, and with the tightened timeframes we created with the new law, the judges emphasized that children's cases will simply not move through the court system in a timely manner. Each court may have their own effective approach to eliminating such backlogs. For some, hiring 
   additional staff may be necessary. For others, creating a ``Night Court'' or ``Saturday Court'' to hear these cases would work. Still others may need to restructure duties of court personnel. This bill will provide grants to those court projects that are designed to result in the effective and rapid elimination of current backlogs to smooth the way for more efficient courts in the future. 
   The Strengthening Abuse and Neglect Courts Act also recognizes that judges, attorneys, court personnel, law enforcement representatives, guardians-ad-litem and all others who participate in abuse and neglect proceedings can benefit from continuing education opportunities, improved training and the development of models for effective practice in these settings. The Act, therefore, extends federal reimbursement for training that is currently provided to agency caseworkers to judges, attorneys and key court personnel who must make decision effecting the lives and future of vulnerable children. In addition to this basic, necessary training for court personnel, we hope it will also foster between cooperation between child welfare agencies and court personnel that is imperative to make system work to ensure the health and safety of children. 
   Finally, the bill provides for an expansion of the successful CASA--Court Appointed Special Advocates--volunteer program. This superb volunteer program has demonstrated its ability to improve outcomes for abused and neglected children. CASA are volunteers specially trained to speak for the best interests of children who have been abused or neglected. There are over 710 CASA programs nationwide, whose volunteers represented nearly 200,000 children last year alone. Recently, the Department of Justice recognized CASA as an ``Exemplary Program''. CASA has been operating in West Virginia since 1991 with programs currently serving children in 13 of our counties. Of course, there is more work to be done so that children in all 55 West Virginia counties, and all under-served areas throughout the country can benefit from the services of these trained and dedicated volunteers. In fact, despite CASA's phenomenal volunteer commitment and national praise by courts, and community leaders, 70% of the children in foster care are still without CASA representation. This bill will begin to address this gap by providing a $5 million grant to expand its programs into under-served areas and to improve its ability to recruit, train and supervise volunteers. 
   When we talk about how to help abused and neglected children in this country, our abuse and neglect courts are too often left out of the discussion. With the numbers of abused and neglected children rising dramatically--in West Virginia alone child abuse reports have doubled--from 13,000 in 1986 to over 26,000 in 1996--we need to include every system in our efforts to make a difference. The courts play a crucial role and I am confident that the Strengthening Abuse and Neglect Courts Act will be a valuable step in making our courts stronger, more efficient and more able to effectively address the needs of our Nation's most vulnerable children. I ask that my colleagues join us in this important effort.

    Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleagues Senator HATCH and Senator BAUCUS in introducing legislation to permanently extend the research and experimentation (R&E) tax credit. This credit provides a major incentive to the private sector to invest in long-range, high-risk research. It has played, and continues to play an important role in fostering private-sector investment in research, driving innovation in our technology-based industries. 
   Economic studies have shown that for each dollar of lost tax revenue, the tax credit stimulates an additional dollar of R&E in the short term and two additional dollars in the long term. These research investments promote technological innovation, enhance job growth, and increase productivity, helping to maintain our nation's quality of life and economic strength and well-being. 
   The R&E tax credit was enacted in 1981, and since then has been temporarily extended nine times, for periods as brief as six months, and has been allowed to lapse at least three times before being renewed retroactively. This is simply not an acceptable situation, especially if we mean to create a business climate which encourages the private sector to fund as much R&E as possible in the U.S., and not to move these activities off shore to countries that offer more substantial tax and financial incentives. This is a particularly critical concern for our high-growth, research-intensive industries, such as those in the computer, telecommunications, and biotechnology sectors. These companies depend on the R&E tax credit to undertake and continue long-term research projects. To ensure the success of such projects it is essential that our support for industry research is both continuous and predictable--our future competitiveness in the world marketplace depends upon it. 
   The federal government is reducing its commitment to research and development. We therefore need to encourage the private sector to expand its investment in this area. By making the R&E tax credit permanent, so that companies can count on its availability from year to year in planning their research investments, we create an environment conducive to promoting investment in R&E. We must not allow a system characterized by the uncertainty of frequent expirations and renewals to continue. I therefore urge my colleagues to join me in support of this legislation to make the R&E tax credit permanent.

   Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, in the couple of moments remaining before the 4:15 vote, I rise in strong support of the 2-month extension of the Federal Aviation Administration's Airport Improvement Program. The AIP, as it is known, Airport Improvement Program, is absolutely basic to virtually all of our Nation's airports, and in rural States it is particularly important. 
   We were unable to complete our work on this last year for a variety of reasons that I am not going to dwell on, but I do want to emphasize how important it is that we pass this 2-month reauthorization extension. 
   Airports in West Virginia, South Dakota, I would presume Wyoming, and all other places are going to need this money in the planning of runway projects, in terms of resurfacing and repairing runways, infrastructure. And all of that is tremendously important. 
   I think people often tend to underestimate the power of the growth of the aviation industry and the enormous consequences that go along with that. We tend to think that it is a large industry, but we do not really know whether it is growing or not that much. It is one of the most dynamic. It is not up there quite with the Internet in its growth, but it is not that far behind. Americans are flying in absolute record numbers, and the growth in air traffic alone will be just under 4 percent for each of the next 12 years. People are getting on airplanes; 600 million people this year in this country. That is going to go up to 820 million in several years. When you get that kind of growth, you cannot just leave what you have been using in place unchanged and unrenovated. It has to be modern. It has to work. It has to be safe. 
   This year the FAA, and in particular its Airport Improvement Program, is being forced to do this kind of improvement work in a very piecemeal fashion. That is not good. That is not safe. It is not modern and, when you are playing around with the world of aviation, it is very, very unwise. The short-term extension is what we are doing, frankly, because that is the best we can do. It doesn't mean it is the best that we could do; it is the best that we can do. 
   In Congress, sometimes, you have to do that. 
   I am very committed, as I know Chairman MCCAIN is, Senator HOLLINGS, and Senator GORTON, to enacting a full and comprehensive reauthorization of the FAA and airport improvement bill this year. That will come. There will be discussions and controversy, but that will come. We passed a bill out of the Commerce Committee, so we are on our way on that. 
   We have other things we have to look at. We have to look at the modernization of the FAA system itself, our air traffic control system. We happen to have an absolutely superb individual, Mr. President, running the FAA in the person of Jane Garvey--absolutely superb. In working with her, you can just see all kinds of good things happening. But we have to reauthorize so that we can get on to modernizing our air traffic control system, modernizing certain parts of the FAA itself, its institutional structure, and dealing with the whole question of how we allocate aviation dollars. 
   For the moment, what we need is what we have at hand, the pending measure, a 2-month extension of the reauthorization. I hope soon my colleagues will go along with that. 
   I thank my friend, the distinguished Presiding Officer. I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.

    Mr. ROCKEFELLER. This week marks the 10th anniversary of the Department of Veterans Affairs, which elevated the Veterans Administration (previously an independent federal agency) to cabinet-level status. This move capped the gradual evolution of a governmental response to the needs of veterans--beginning with the Plymouth colony's first pension law in 1636, and proceeding through a variety of federal bureaus with shared responsibility for ministering to veterans, before those agencies were unified into one. 
   The creation of the Department of Veterans Affairs has both a real and a symbolic meaning. By raising the agency to cabinet level, the Nation's chief veterans' advocate--the Secretary of Veterans Affairs--was literally given a seat at the table with all other major executive agencies, and direct access to the President. Symbolically, veterans were accorded ``a voice at the highest level of government,'' in the words of former VA Secretary Jesse Brown. This is as it should be for the second largest agency of the federal government, whose sole mission is to serve those whose sacrifices are the very backbone of the freedoms we all enjoy. 
   As current VA Secretary Togo D. West, Jr., has said, ``Cabinet status has brought many benefits; but is has also brought increased obligations.'' The VA plays a major role nationally in the fields of health care, education, insurance, and housing. As the Nation's budget is divided up, it is important that VA be on a level playing field with other federal departments to effectively safeguard our veterans' interests. 
   I want to take this opportunity to salute the many talented, caring, and dedicated employees of the Department who are at the heart of its operations. I know they labor under a heavy workload, particularly in this era of tightening budgets. We must ensure they have the resources they need to carry out their mission. 
   The Department's 10th anniversary marks a happy milestone, a decade of growth and accomplishments. My warmest congratulations to all who share in this achievement.

    Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I am pleased to be introducing the ``Advance Planning and Compassionate Care Act of 1999'' with my colleague from Maine, Senator COLLINS. We introduce this legislation to ask Congress to take action that responds directly and humanely to the needs of the elderly and others during some of their most difficult and traumatic times of their lives. The time I refer to is the end-of-life. 
   Our perceptions of illness, end-of-life care, and death are changing in response to advances in medical technology, a shift from treating acute care illnesses to managing chronic care conditions, improvements in palliative care, and a greater respect for patient involvement and autonomy in end-of-life decisions. 
   Patients want to maintain a sense of control of their lives throughout their last days. But studies show that tremendous variation exists in the medical care that Medicare beneficiaries receive in the last few months of their lives. This sort of analysis highlights that patient preferences have little to do with the sort of care patients receive in their final months of life. Where you live determines the sort of medical care you will receive more so than what you might prefer. Our bill addresses this issue by calling for an evaluation of current standards of care and promoting better communication between health care providers and their patients. 
   Unfortunately, while people do worry about end-of-life issues, the truth is that patients, families, and physicians have difficulty talking about them. People have an endless list of reasons for not talking about end-of-life care, for not making decisions to prepare for it. Some are afraid of jinxing themselves by planning their end-of-life care, and many have faith that their families will know the right thing to do when the time comes. 
   Not talking about death does not stop it from occurring. We all know it is a natural, inevitable part of life. But by not talking about end-of-life care, we hamper our ability to learn about the options that are available to relieve suffering, promote personal choice, and obtain greater care and comfort in our final months. 
   End-of-life care is a major--and growing--issue in the future of health care. Unfortunately, in recent years, debates on end-of-life care have focused almost exclusively on the subject of physician-assisted suicide. Mr. President, I have spent considerable time delving into the concerns and dilemmas that face patients, their family members and their physicians when confronted with death or the possibility of dying. In almost all such difficult situations, people are not thinking about physician-assisted suicide. The needs and dilemmas that confront them have much more to do with the kind of care and information they need desperately. 
   The legislation we are introducing today builds on bipartisan legislation enacted in 1990, called the Patient Self-Determination Act. As a result of that bill, hospitals, skilled nursing facilities, home health agencies, hospice programs, and HMO's participating in the Medicaid and Medicare programs must provide every adult receiving medical care with written information concerning patient involvement in their own treatment decisions. The health care institutions must also document in the medical record whether the patient has an advance directive. In addition, States were required to write descriptions of their State laws concerning advance directives. 
   The first section of the Advance Planning and Compassionate Care Act instructs the Department of Health and Human Services to develop appropriate quality measures and models of care for persons with chronic, debilitating illnesses, including the very frail elderly who will comprise an increasing number of Medicare beneficiaries. 
   The second part of our bill directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to advise Congress on an approach to adopting the provisions of the Uniform Health Care Decisions Act for Medicare beneficiaries. The Uniform Health Care Decisions Act was developed by the Uniform Law Commissioners, a group with representation from all States that has been in existence for over 100 years. The Uniform Health Care Decisions Act includes all the important 
   components of model advance directive legislation. A great deal of legal effort went into its development, with input by all the States and approval by the American Bar Association. Medicare beneficiaries deserve a uniform approach to advance directives, especially since many move from one State to another while in the Medicare Program. The tremendous variation in State laws that currently exists only adds to the confusion of health care professionals and their patients. 
   The third section strengthens the previously enacted Patient Self Determination Act in the following ways: 
   First, it requires that every Medicare beneficiary have the opportunity to discuss health care decision-making issues with an appropriately trained professional, when he or she makes a request. This measure would help make sure that patients and their families have the ability to discuss and address concerns and issues relating to their care, including end-of-life care, with a trained professional. Many health care institutions already have teams of providers to address difficult health care decisions and some even mediate among patients, families, and providers. In smaller institutions, social workers, chaplains, nurses or other trained professionals could be made available for consultation. 
   Second, our bill requires that a person's advance directive be placed in a prominent part of the medical record. Often advance directives cannot even be found in the medical record, making  it more difficult for providers to respect patients' wishes. It is essential that an individual's advance directive be readily available and visible to anyone involved in their health care. 
   Third, it will assure that an advance directive valid in one State will be valid in another State. At present, portability of advance directives from State to State is not assured. Such portability can only be guaranteed through Federal legislation. 
   The fourth part of this legislation would encourage the development of models for end-of-life care for Medicare beneficiaries who do not qualify for the Medicare hospice benefit but still have chronic, debilitating and ultimately fatal illnesses. The tremendous advances in medicine and medical technology over the past 30 to 50 years have resulted in a greatly lengthened life expectancy for Americans, as well as vastly improved functioning and quality of life for the elderly and those with chronic disease. Many of these advances have been made possible by federally financed health care programs, such as the Medicare Program that assures access to high quality health care for all elderly Americans. Medicare has also funded much of the development of technology and a highly skilled physician workforce through support of medical education and academic medical centers. These advances have also created major dilemmas in addressing terminal or potentially terminal disease, as well as a sense of loss of control by many with terminal illness. 
   Mr. President, I am learning more and more about the importance of educating health care providers and the public that chronic, debilitating, terminal disease need not be associated with pain, major discomfort, and loss of control. We can control pain and treat depression, as well as the other causes of suffering during the dying process. We must now apply this knowledge to assure all Americans appropriate end-of-life care. And to make sure that Medicare beneficiaries are able to receive the most effective medicine to control their pain, Medicare's coverage rules would be expanded under our bill to include coverage for self-administered pain medications. 
   Mr. President, I realize that there is still a lot of work to be done. I believe our bill represents a significant step towards improving end-of-life care for Medicare beneficiaries. By advocating changes within the health care system, research community, and national policy, we reaffirm our commitment to quality patient care. In our legislation, we have set forth a broad framework to respond to many of the concerns facing people at the end-of-life. This legislation embodies the fundamental principle of the Patient Self-Determination Act--to involve patients in their own treatment decisions and to respect and follow their wishes when they are no longer capable of voicing them. 
   To conclude, I am proud to offer this legislation with Senator COLLINS. We hope consideration of this bill will be an opportunity to take notice of the many constructive steps that can be taken to address the needs of patients and family members grappling with great pain and medical difficulties. During this time when physician assisted suicide obtains so many headlines, we are eager to call on Congress to turn to the alternative ways of providing help and relief to seniors and other Americans who only are interested in such alternatives.

    Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill that will, twenty years after the Staggers Rail Act, finally deliver the benefits of market competition to the railroad industry and its customers--the Railroad Competition and Service Improvement Act of 1999. I am joined in this effort by Senators DORGAN, BURNS, ROBERTS and CONRAD, and I thank them for their leadership on this bill for the benefit not only of rail customers but also the future health of the railroads themselves. 
   As many of my colleagues know, there are certain issues that I feel especially strongly about, and all of them are issues that have far-reaching consequences for the State of West Virginia and for our nation. Competition--or the lack thereof--in the railroad industry is one of those issues. 
   In the United States we have a railroad industry that has gone from 63 class I railroads in 1976 to 9 class I railroads today, of which only 5 control the vast majority of rail freight across the country: 2 in the East, 2 in the West, and one down the Mississippi River in the middle of the country. We also have a railroad industry with service problems so expansive and so disruptive that grain and chemical and other manufacturers have lost tens of millions of dollars in recent years, must operate with the vulnerability of future service crises, and have no choice but to constantly be on the lookout for better and more reliable transportation options. And we have a railroad industry that seems continually to assert undue and anti-competitive power over its customers in increasing local monopoly situations. 
   I believe the railroad industry is at a crossroads. It's been nearly twenty years since the Staggers Rail Act of 1980, which limited the regulation of the railroad industry by allowing government intervention only where a railroad customer has no effective means of competition. By many measures, the railroads are in far better financial health today, and rail freight transportation is far more safe, stable and efficient than in the dire days of the 1970s. 
   Yet despite these apparent gains, shippers across the nation are broadly discontent. As a significant new report from the General Accounting Office confirms, rail shippers believe that in the aftermath of Staggers--and in direct conflict with the intent of Staggers--we have in fact created a system that very heavily, and with tremendous financial consequences, favors monopoly railroads and shuts shippers out of the regulatory process that is supposed to protect them. 
   We have put in place a system that leaves 70 percent of shippers with poorer rate and service options than they need to run their businesses cost-efficiently, and a system in which nearly 60 percent of shippers fear retaliation from the railroads should they access the rate relief process--a process which costs between $500,000 and $3 million per complaint and can take up to 16 years to get a resolution. The GAO makes crystal clear that the rate relief process for shippers with no competitive rail options is too costly and too time-consuming to be effective. 
   Now some would say that customers always want more and better service, always want lower prices, and always are unhappy--so we should discount their railroad customer concerns and leave the system alone. They would say that the railroads are happy with the status quo, so Staggers must be working well. 
   To my mind, that's a cop-out. The ``shipping community'' is the backbone of our nation--they are our farmers, our auto and chemical manufacturers, our utilities, our coal miners, our forest products workers--and they're not just crying wolf. They have legitimate problems with a skewed system, and they deserve the Congress' full attention and a commitment to deal with increased concentration and a developing pattern of service problems by infusing some degree of real and effective competition into the railroad industry as a whole. 
   The legislation we introduce today is designed to do just that: it will jump-start competition and uphold the common carrier obligation by requiring railroads to quote a rate on any given segment; it will reduce monopoly routing by facilitating terminal access; it will streamline the rate relief process by simplifying the market dominance test; it will restore the integrity of the Surface Transportation Board by eliminating its annual revenue adequacy pronouncements; it will bolster rail access for small farmers by creating a targeted rate relief process; and it will require the railroads to file monthly service performance reports with the Department of Transportation, similar to what we require of the airline industry, so that rail customers have access to the information they need to make good railroad and transportation choices. 
   We intend to offer this legislation as an amendment to the Surface Transportation Board reauthorization legislation later this year, and we especially look forward to working with our colleagues on the Commerce and Agriculture Committees to that end.

   Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, on Tuesday, March 9, 1999, I missed the second cloture vote on S. 280, the Education Flexibility Act. 
   I fully intended to be in the chamber for the vote yesterday, and had I been there I would have voted against cloture. While I support the concept of flexibility for education, I also believe that Democrats deserve right to offer education amendments on key priorities such as reducing class-size, providing after-school care, addressing the concern of crumbling schools, and a few other major priorities. 
   Senate Democrats have offered in good faith to accept time agreements and limited debates on our education priorities. 
   It is disappointing that instead of voting on education priorities for American students, teachers, and parents, we are debating procedural motions and closure petitions. Instead of using the time wisely to discuss the major education issues facing our schools, we are facing gridlock on procedure. That is not what the American people sent us to the Senate to do. We are willing to have our debate and cast our votes to reduce class sizes, to fix crumbling schools and to provide after-school care for children that need it to learn and be safe while parents work. If our Democratic amendments prevail, we strengthen the Education Flexibility Act and help schools. If our amendments do not get a majority, then we had the opportunity to debate and we can move forward on the underlying bipartisan legislation. 
   I wish I had been here on Tuesday to participate. Unfortunately, I got trapped in Charleston, West Virginia when the Ronald Reagan National Airport closed at 11 a.m. on March 9, 1999 due to the snow storm in Washington, DC. I had been in Charleston, West Virginia to vote in the mayoral election and to participate in the United Airlines announcement of two Mileage Plus Service Centers in my state which will create 600 new jobs. The new centers will be located in Charleston and Huntington. This is exciting news for my state, and I have been in touch with officials for months about this economic opportunity. At the time, I felt that I could personally vote in the local election, attend this exciting announcement and return in plenty of time for the 2:45 vote on the Senate floor. Due to the snow storm, I missed the vote.

   Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, today, along with Senator HOLLINGS, I am introducing the Administration's legislative proposal for reauthorizing the programs of the Federal Aviation Administration. I do so at the request of Transportation Secretary Rodney Slater who is eager to have the Senate consider his key initiatives. 
   Among other provisions, the bill includes a number of initiatives that will be beneficial to small communities, modeled in part after S. 379, the Air Service Restoration Act, which I introduced earlier this year, along with Senators DORGAN, WYDEN, HARKIN, and BINGAMAN. Several of these provisions also have been incorporated into the FAA reauthorization bill, S. 82, which has been favorably reported by the Commerce Committee. 
   Many of my colleagues share my own commitment to addressing the critical needs and concerns of small communities--the challenges they face in general, and the lack of air service in particular. I am very pleased that the Secretary's bill offers leadership in this area. 
   I must also point out, however, that there are other areas of the Administration's bill that I am reserving judgment on and may not be able to support. The Secretary is aware of my concerns, and I want to work with him and my colleagues on crafting a meaningful legislative package to reform the FAA, strengthen the Airport Improvement Program, enhance aviation competition and address the needs of small communities.

   Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I thank the Chair very much, as I always do, for his uncanny ability to maintain order in the Senate, which is unparalleled. 
   Mr. President, as Ranking Member of the Committee on Veterans' Affairs, I have an especially strong interest in issues that improve the quality of life for the men and women who now serve and have already served in our Nation's military forces. These brave men and women often face extreme hardships in their service to our country, and later, in their efforts to successfully transition back to civilian life. S. 4, the ``Soldiers', Sailors', Airmen's, and Marines' Bill of Rights Act of 1999,'' goes far to address some of these hardships. 
   I believe that a major impetus of S. 4 is to enhance the military's ability to attract and retain the best young men and women to the ranks of America's Armed Forces. But S. 4 also has the collateral effect of improving the lives of servicemembers by providing them with a much-needed pay increase and eliminating the $1,200 contribution that servicemembers must make to the Montgomery GI bill during their first year in service, while their salaries are at their lowest.

   Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I am pleased to offer this amendment, which the Senate passed overwhelmingly last year. Senator JEFFORDS and I offered it, and, with the full concurrence of the Senate, we passed this amendment which I now offer to this very excellent bill, S. 4. 
   The amendment would authorize a pilot project. One of the criticisms of people from my side of the aisle is we try to do everything full scale. I happen to believe if you have something which you think is a good idea but which is not yet necessarily fully tested, that it is a good idea to test it. Therefore, I think the idea of demonstration sites is a very good idea. 
   My amendment would authorize a pilot project to allow the Veterans' Administration to do something which boards and advisory commissions have been advising for years and which many of us have been supporting for years and which the veterans groups all support. That is to allow the Veterans' Administration to bill Medicare for health care services provided to certain dual beneficiaries--people who qualify for both. 
   Senator SPECTER and I are together offering, as chairman and ranking member of the Veterans' Affairs Committee, an amendment. What we basically do in this amendment is authorize a pilot project, as I indicated before, to allow the VA, for the first time, to bill Medicare for health services provided to certain dual beneficiaries. 
   It is known as the VA Medicare subvention amendment or concept. And it has been around for a very long time, as I indicated. Our services organizations have been for it. Virtually every advisory body that has ever taken a look at the Veterans' Administration and its health care has suggested that this has to happen. 
   In the past, many VA hospitals and clinics have been forced to turn away middle-income Medicare-eligible veterans who sought VA care. Last year we made VA open to everybody. On the other hand, people who have Medicare, if they wanted to go to a VA hospital, they would have to pay out-of-pocket costs because Medicare would not pay for it. So Medicare is paying for them at one place but they are not paying for them at a veterans hospital where they might prefer to go, either for professional reasons, medical reasons, geographic reasons, or whatever. 
   So these VA hospitals simply did not have the resources to care for them. Now, due to changes in the law, all enrolled veterans will have access to a uniform, comprehensive benefit package. Yet, resources for veterans' health  care have not increased and, in fact, in the budget have remained absolutely flat. That is another subject which I will not get into today. 
   For veterans, approval of this veterans subvention amendment would mean the infusion of new revenue to their health care system--not more cost--because remember that the Medicare which they are now getting is already being paid out. It is being paid out to wherever they are going. But if they choose to go to the VA hospital, it will actually be Medicare, but, as I will explain in a moment, less. It will be Medicare minus about 5 percent. So the cost factor is very favorable. 
   For the Health Care Financing Administration, HCFA, a VA 
   subvention demonstration project would provide the opportunity to assess the effects of coordination on improving efficiency, access, and quality of care for dual-eligible beneficiaries in a selected number of sites--let's say, 8, 9, 10, 6, whatever it might be. 
   Congress would receive the results of this test study, this demonstration project. You do it in various States or parts of States, and then you would know, how do veterans react? Do they want to keep their Medicare at the hospital they are going to already, which is not a VA hospital, or now, if we pass this amendment as was passed in the reconciliation bill last year, will they decide, no, we want to go to the veterans hospital because it is closer to our home, we feel more comfortable there, we are among our colleagues there? And Medicare would pay for it. In either event, Medicare is paying. But if they go to the VA hospital, under our demonstration, Medicare would pay 5 percent less in fact. 
   So Congress would then get the results of this test study, Mr. President. And then, once and for all, it would give us the really necessary data, the experiential data, the medical data, to make rational policy decisions in the future about Medicare and VA's involvement: Are they going to cross fertilize in a useful way or are they not? 
   In my own State of West Virginia, there are four centers of the Veterans' Administration. They spent nearly $5 million caring for middle-income, Medicare-eligible veterans last year. Although this is useful information, I cannot provide my colleagues with the really interesting piece of the story; and that is, the number of these Medicare-eligible veterans who are out there. Remember, there are 27 million of them. And except for about 3.3 million of them, all of them, if they now go to a VA hospital, will have to pay out of pocket; they cannot use Medicare. 
   That is what this amendment is about. So what we want to find out is, how many veterans are there, who are out there now in this test area, who cannot bring their Medicare coverage with them to the VA hospital because it does not do them any good and therefore they have to pay out of pocket? This demonstration project would encourage, hopefully, these eligible veterans who have not previously received care at VA hospitals to be able to make the decision whether or not that is what they want: Do they want to go to Beckley or Martinsburg or Clarksburg or Huntington to get their health care, or do they want to stay with their present health care situation? 
   As in years past, this amendment is designed to be budget neutral. To that end, the Veterans' Administration will be required to maintain its current level of services to Medicare-eligible veterans already being served and would be effectively limited to reimbursement for additional health care provided to entirely new users. 
   Payments from Medicare would be, as I said, at a reduced rate--about 5 percent less than their ordinary rate. Disproportionate share hospital adjustments would be excluded from all of this. Graduate medical education payments would be excluded from this, not a part of it. A large percentage of capital-related costs would be excluded from all of this. 
   So, in effect, the Veterans' Administration would be providing health care to Medicare-eligible veterans at a deeply discounted rate. It is a pretty good deal. It is a pretty good deal. The Department of Health and Human Services and the 
   Veterans' Administration would have the ability to adjust payment rates, and, frankly, they would have the ability to shrink or in fact to terminate the program if they did not like the direction that Medicare costs were going. 
   In the event that all of these safeguards included in the proposed amendment fail, an event which the VA does not anticipate will happen, then Senator SPECTER and I, specifically in our amendment, propose caps to all Medicare payments to the VA at $50 million for an entire year.

   Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I thank the distinguished chairman of the Armed Services Committee and the Presiding Officer. 
   Just three comments: No. 1, I think it is really important to remember that the Department of Defense now has Medicare subvention. DOD has Medicare subvention. And they have it on a test basis. The VA is asking for Medicare subvention on a test basis. 
   I ask my colleagues, is it really fair in that this is basically a no-cost item and perhaps a cost savings for the DOD people to have it and for VA not to have it when ultimately this is an enormously important test for the future of veterans' health care policy and where they are going to get it. 
   Second, the point has been made--not on this floor by the people here but referring to others--that this has not gone through the regular process. This has been through the regular process. Senator JEFFORDS and I introduced this yesterday. And it was introduced last year. It passed through the Finance Committee and the Budget Committee last year, and it went through the reconciliation process last year. This has been through the process. It was dropped in conference. It has been through the process. That needs to be made. 
   Third, that a veteran ought to have the right to decide where he or she wants to get their health care service with their Medicare dollars--and it is a superb way to find out, in fact, what veterans think of VA and/or their present health care service systems. It has to happen. It is good policy. And it is probably a cost saving policy. When the time comes for the vote, I hope that my colleagues will vote ``no'' on the motion to table. 
   We do a lot of talk about supporting veterans, and we do the best we can. But this is a very important basically no-cost health care way to give veterans something they desperately need and deserve. 
   I thank the Chair. I thank the distinguished Presiding Officer.

   Mr. ROCKEFELLER. There is no reason to do that. Let me make a few comments and maybe the Senator can expedite the business of the Senate and we can go to the vote. 
   I want to bring up one matter, Mr. President. The Senator from West Virginia wishes to bring up one matter which was, in fact, not discussed, but which is of some aggravation to me since it comes from the Congressional Budget Office, and it was addressed to me, but I never got it. I had to go to the Finance Committee staff to get it. In that, they sort of attacked the whole idea of what this was going to cost and all the rest of it. I want to respond to that. 
   This is the cost estimate that Senator ROTH was able to get from CBO just 1 hour ago. In fairly strong terms, I want to say that CBO ought to be embarrassed by their efforts, they ought to be ashamed, and I want to tell you why. 
   First, my amendment is not based on a more costly House bill, as the CBO estimate claims. 
   It is based on the DOD subvention bill that Congress enacted and that DOD beneficiaries are already enjoying. So it is already out there. It is also based on a subvention proposal which moved through the Finance Committee, moved through the Senate, and then was killed in conference by presumably the House, dropped in conference by the House. 
   Second, the Congressional Budget Office claims that my amendment does not attempt to limit the erosion of what VA is paying now. That is not true. They cannot be allowed to get away with that. The VA currently carries a substantial burden for caring for medical-eligible veterans. There are substantial provisions in my amendment with Senator SPECTER, Senator KENNEDY and others that they will continue to do so. Every possible safeguard is littered throughout our amendment--for example, to protect the Medicare trust fund; to be selected as a pilot site. That is what I am suggesting in this amendment--only a pilot program, not full scale; just a pilot. 
   If the veterans who have Medicare took it to the VA system right now for health care, they would have to pay out of pocket because they can't get reimbursed under Medicare law. What I am trying to do is let them make the decision if they want to stay where they are or if they want to go to the VA hospital; let them make the decision. It is budget neutral. 
   But to get back, to be selected as a pilot site--I am not talking about the whole program; just a pilot site. 
   VA hospitals must receive certification that they have reliable cost-accounting systems in place to ensure that the VA will know that their current level of effort to provide health care to Medicare-eligible veterans is good. HHS can come in and squash it. 
   We also have exactly the same data-match requirement in my amendment that is in the DOD bill, which is in effect. Maybe the Congressional Budget Office didn't read this. 
   Also, just as a final backup position, in case in some way I am wrong, we have specifically in this amendment that Medicare payments to the VA are capped at $50 million a year. Medicare spent $207 billion a year last year. It will spend $470 billion 10 years from now, if we don't do something in the commission, which I just had to leave. But they are wrong to suggest what they do. That has to go on the Record. 
   I will simply conclude. I also say to the distinguished ranking member and the chairman that this has been through the process. This is a very, very good amendment, which everybody in my 15 years of experience in  this body, all the Medicare commissions, all the VA commissions, all the future health commissions that are replete--that have looked at this problem have all suggested we do Medicare subvention to give the veterans the choice of where they want to take their health care. Since they are already getting paid Medicare anyway at a private hospital, if perchance they were to go to a veterans hospital, that would be fine, because it might be geographically or more collegially helpful. Medicare would be paying 5 percent less to that VA hospital than they would be to wherever they are going now. 
   You tell me how we lose on that in the Medicare trust fund. We do nothing but win in terms of veterans. We have been discussing this for years. We discussed it in the past before the chairman of the committee corrected me on the year. He is quite right. I was quite wrong. But it was 2 years ago--not last year. DOD is doing this. I would simply ask that my colleagues vote against the amendment to table, because I think this is a truly significant amendment. 
   Mr. WARNER addressed the Chair.

   Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I understand what the distinguished chairman is saying. I would only counter that in the veterans committee we are rather accustomed to having our jurisdiction violated. And although, it has caused me to lose some sleep at night, I tend to make that a little less important as to what is happening to the veteran, in which case I think this is enormous consideration. I further point out that in this DOD bill already the VA and the veterans committee are already substantially compromised. I am not objecting to that, because there are substantial VA things in it. I think this is a powerfully important piece of legislation. 
   I appreciate the Senator's forbearance.

   Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I am pleased to offer my support to the Veterans' Equal Access to Medicare Act. This bill will authorize a pilot project to allow VA to bill Medicare for health care services provided to certain dual beneficiaries. The legislation is known as VA Medicare subvention, which is a concept that has been discussed over the years by those of us in Congress, by veterans service organizations, and by virtually every advisory body that has studied the VA health care system. I join my colleague Senator JEFFORDS in this initiative. 
   In the past, many VA hospitals and clinics have been forced to turn away middle income, Medicare-eligible veterans who sought VA care. These hospitals simply did not have the resources to care for them. Now, with eligibility reform, all enrolled veterans will have access to a uniform, comprehensive benefit package. Yet, resources for veterans' health care have not increased, and, in fact, have remained flatlined. 
   During the first session of the 105th Congress, Senator JEFFORDS and I successfully pushed a similar proposal through the Senate Finance Committee and the full Senate. The basic tenets of the current bill remain the same. For veterans, enactment of the Veterans' Equal Access to Medicare Act would mean the infusion of new revenue and, thus, improved access to care. For the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA), a VA subvention demonstration project will provide the opportunity to assess the effects of coordination on improving efficiency, access, and quality of care for dual-eligible beneficiaries in a selected number of sites. Finally, Congress would receive the results of this feasibility study, which, once and for all, would give us the necessary data to make rational policy decisions in the future about Medicare and VA's involvement. 
   The four VA medical centers in my own State of West Virginia spent nearly $5 million caring for Medicare-eligible veterans with middle incomes last year. Although this is telling information, I cannot provide my colleagues with the truly crucial piece of the story--that is, the number of these Medicare-eligible veterans who had been turned away over the years from the very facilities created to serve them because of lack of resources. This demonstration project would encourage these eligible veterans who have not previously received care from the Huntington, Beckley, Martinsburg, and Clarksburg VA Medical Centers to do so, while providing Medicare with cost-savings opportunities. 
   As in years past, the Veterans' Equal Access to Medicare Act is designed to be budget neutral. To that end, the VA would be required to maintain its current level of services to Medicare-eligible veterans already being served, and would be effectively limited to reimbursement for additional care provided to new users. Payments from Medicare would be at a reduced rate and would exclude Disproportionate Share Hospital adjustments, Graduate Medical Education payments, and a large percentage of capital-related costs. In effect, the VA would be providing health care to Medicare-eligible veterans at a deeply discounted rate. The Department of Health and Human Services and VA would have the ability to adjust payment rates, or to shrink or terminate the program if Medicare's costs increase. In the event that these safeguards included in the proposal fail--an event which the VA has declared unlikely--this proposal caps all Medicare payments to the VA at $50 million.

   Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. Chief Justice, I rise today to announce, or simply declare, that I will vote not guilty on both articles of impeachment and to urge my colleagues to spare the country the injustice of removing a President who has been twice elected to his office by the American people, and whom they continue to trust to lead them. 
   As a Senator, I have taken my trial oath very, very seriously. For my part, I have listened intently to the presentations, carefully considered the evidence, read everything that I could get my hands on, and thought about those matters carefully. I have read, and reread, the key language of our Constitution, and thought long and hard about the words of our Founding Fathers. In fact, the Constitution, in many ways, came alive for me for the first time. 
   I am humbled by the wisdom and foresight of our founders as I struggle through some of the most profound questions that our democracy can present to us. What is the balance of power between the three branches of Government? How do we measure public trust, and under what circumstances may the Senate exercise its most devastating power--the power to overturn a popular election, and a power, therefore, to remove a President from office? 
   As I confront these questions, I am acutely conscious of the terrible disappointment of our Nation in the personal and public behavior of our President. No one of us would defend his actions. No one of us would say that he is free of serious fault. 
   I have condemned in the strongest possible terms that I know how to do--and I have done it to him directly--the conduct of the President in the Lewinsky matter. And I share the sense of outrage that so many of my constituents from West Virginia have shared with me. 
   When first confronted with this shameful affair, the President deliberately misled his family, his friends, and his staff. He went on national television, and, as far as I am concerned, lied to the American people, and he walked a troubling line between truth and deception in his sworn testimony, all in an effort to keep this scandal out of the humiliating glare of public scrutiny. 
   It is without question a very serious moral matter. But the ultimate power of the U.S. Senate--the power to convict and remove the President for high crimes and misdemeanors--is not a power to pass moral judgment or render moral punishment. It is not even a power to render a judicial conviction or judicial punishment. The power of the Senate is drawn carefully and narrowly by the Constitution of the United States, and it is a power to sit in judgment of a President only as a means of protecting our Nation from great harm. It is a power to remove a President only if he has committed treason, bribery or other high crimes and misdemeanors against the state.  
   As U.S. Senators, the Constitution must be our predominant guidepost. It must be the compass we come back to at every point of hesitation or ambiguity or doubt. ``Treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors''--these words are powerful, extraordinary, and carefully crafted. We know how very grave treason and bribery are, and we know that they involve a fundamental corruption of public office. But what about high crimes and misdemeanors? The words, ``or other high crimes and misdemeanors,'' on its face means high crimes and high misdemeanors. 
   Borrowing from my good friend, Senator BIDEN, the word, ``treason,'' was defined in the Constitution itself. The word, ``bribery,'' was not. It was a definition fixed at common law. These are both relatively definite terms. But ``high crimes and misdemeanors'' are indefinite. 
   In this setting, two rules of construction led us to add the word--Madison and Mason to add the word--``or other,'' in their famous colloquy. The word, ``other,'' is, to me, fascinating, because what it does is essentially return us to the previous clause, which is ``treason and bribery.'' It says that ``high crimes and misdemeanors'' must necessarily be interpreted at the same level of, even though less definite than, ``bribery and treason.'' 
   I think that is clear. I think that is uncontested. 
   As U.S. Senators, the Constitution must be, as I said, our guidepost. We know from the statements of our founders that the phrase was intended in a very careful way--``high crimes and misdemeanors''--to cover only very grave and threatening abuses of Presidential duty and public office. 
   The House managers contend, as did Independent Counsel Ken Starr before them, that in the course of hiding his illicit affair from the world, the President committed perjury, obstruction of justice, and those crimes are so serious that they constitute, by definition, high crimes and misdemeanors, demanding conviction and immediate removal from office, something that has never happened before in the history of our Nation. 
   Most of this body are lawyers. And I think that most would agree--all of us would agree--the questions that must be answered by all of us in this Senate are: 
   First, did the President commit perjury or obstruction of justice as charged by the articles of impeachment? 
   Second, did the President's conduct rise to the level of high crimes and misdemeanors requiring removal? 
   The answer to both of these questions must be yes in order for the President to be removed from office. If either one of these questions fails, then by definition the Constitution demands that the President be acquitted. 
   On the basis of the case presented over the last several weeks, on the basis of the evidence and the deposition testimony, which I reviewed carefully and in full, and on the basis of the constitutional arguments made by each side, I have concluded unequivocally that the answer to both questions is no, and that the articles of impeachment are not well founded and must be rejected. 
   First and foremost, the House managers have utterly failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the President committed perjury or obstructed justice. Their case is speculative, circumstantial, and contradicted by facts. 
   Admittedly, the burden of proof on the House managers is a very heavy one. 
   We have a presumption in this country of innocence until proven guilty. And we have a presumption that national elections should be upheld. 
   With the fate of a twice-elected President before us in this Senate, I believe that the evidence must be the universally accepted standard of proof that is applied to other criminal cases. It must be proven beyond a reasonable doubt. 
   What does that mean, to prove a case beyond reasonable doubt? It means that it is proven to a moral certainty, that the case is clear, that the case is concise. It means that, if there are doubts about the evidence, about the case, then he must be acquitted. 
   In the case presented by the House managers in the managers' version of the Clinton-Lewinsky story, there are many, many reasonable doubts. 
   There are the doubts about the articles themselves, which are ambiguous, and what conduct actually purported to be criminal. There are serious doubts about the perjury charge in which the President openly acknowledges his inappropriate behavior--and his effort to keep it secret from the Nation. There are doubts about the obstruction charges in which the President is accused of a vast conspiratorial scheme to influence witnesses and testimony, even though everyone involved has denied that any such effort occurred. No person, regardless of the stature or position, could, or should be, convicted on evidence that is so ambiguous and so questionable, and to my way of thinking ultimately, weak. 
   Second, and equally important, no matter how deplorable the President's conduct, the charges clearly do not meet the constitutional test for conviction. They simply do not rise to the level of treason, bribery or other high crimes and high misdemeanors, as I would put it. Any other conduct, any other charges, are left to the judgment of the people in casting of their 
   votes, and to the judgment of the courts once the President has left office. 
   Despite the anger that we feel at the President, despite misgivings that we have about his honesty, despite his lies to the American people, we cannot allow emotions--or, I might say, homilies--or partisanship to interfere with our judgment. The Constitution alone puts us in the box from which we dare not venture. 
   On impeachment, our constitutional history is well established. And we in the Senate and across the Nation must abide by it, and abide by it strictly. We may remove a President only for using his great office to commit high crimes against the Nation, against the state, and against the people. There is no question in my mind that the President has not done this. We would be derelict in our duties as Senators if we removed him for anything less. 
   So, given the weakness of the evidence supporting the charges made by the House, given the serious doubt in the Senate that the charges rise to the level of demanding removal from office, how do we find ourselves so far down this dangerous constitutional path? 
   How do we in the Senate find ourselves so close to the brink of removing a President from office without clear and compelling evidence that crimes against the state were committed? 
   How was an independent counsel investigation allowed to turn into a five-year, $50 million crusade against the President? 
   And, why have we not been able to debate the real issues for the future of our nation--strengthening Medicare, reforming Social Security, ending the steel import crisis so West Virginia steelworkers can get their jobs back? 
   It is clear that, in the end, justice will be done, and the Constitution will have protected the nation. I have been dismayed by growing partisanship, but the bottom line is that the President should not be removed from office, and he will not be removed from office. 
   With the greatest respect for each of my colleagues, I must say there is something very wrong with the fact that we have been forced to take this so far, and that the Senate has been rendered impotent for so long. Even in the face of unceasing calls to end this investigation--from people in every state, from every background and political party--it has marched on relentlessly. 
   I do not believe that it was ever the will of the House of Representatives or the Senate to pursue these charges against the President to such great and absurd lengths. Yet we have--and in the process, a growing crack in the civil and moral foundation of our government has been revealed. 
   It has become clear to me that a destructive momentum has taken hold, and supplanted the better judgement of some in this Congress and in this country. 
   From the start, there has been a core of political interests that has sought every opportunity and pursued every tactic to attack this Presidency. Every President faces critics who will go to great lengths to fight his policies. But this President has faced unprecedented and unyielding attempts by a small group of determined activists to destroy him, his family, and his work.  
   Unfortunately, these efforts at destruction have been aided by a media inside the beltway that has accepted nearly every rumor--proven or unproven--and splash it across the front page or put it at the top of the evening newscast. Ratings and revenues too often have taken priority over sound and judicious coverage of the news. Far from serving the public interest, this has only fueled the efforts of those who have sought to undermine the reasoned pursuit of truth and justice. 
   As I made clear earlier, none of this diminishes my belief that the President's actions were wrong and indefensible. His personal failures in this matter deserve our condemnation. 
   But his failures do not deserve--and have never deserved--the relentless attempts at political and personal destruction that he has been subject to. His failures do not deserve--and have never deserved--the triggering of a constitutional process that our Founding Fathers reserved for the most serious crimes against the nation. 
   I do not say this to fan the flames of partisan division. After all, each of us--Republican or Democrat--has and will make mistakes, and each of us must be held accountable for our mistakes. But no member of the Senate, no member of the House, no elected official who serves this country to his or her best ability deserves the sort of insidious venom that has become such a common part of our political discourse. 
   Let me also be clear that I say this not solely in defense of President Clinton--but principally in defense of civility and fairness in our political society. I say this with sincere hope that we can bring to an end the destructive momentum that has gripped this nation and this city. Because, as disturbing as the President's actions are, I am far more concerned by the fanaticism of those who have driven our great nation so close to the precipice. 
   For our system of Democracy to be successful for another two centuries, it must be driven by people's best instincts--not their worst. It must be founded in moral strength and guided by civil discourse. We must, as Minority Leader Gephardt has so eloquently stated, end the politics of personal destruction. 
   I have great hope that we can do this, because as I look around, I see a vast majority of Americans who are tired of good leaders being destroyed by a vindictive minority. I see a majority of Americans who understand clearly that President Clinton should not be removed from office for his deep personal failings. I see a majority of Americans who know better than to believe everything and anything they hear in the media. 
   The American people want us to seek the truth--they, in fact, demand it. But with equal vigor, they demand that we cast fair judgement; and they demand that in seeking the truth, we do not seek to destroy lives and careers. 
   I believe that this Senate is prepared to cast a fair judgment on the President. We have been through a trying time in our nation's history--a time that not one of us has relished or gained the least bit of satisfaction from. We have all done our best to seek impartial justice, and I am certain that history will judge us well in this pursuit. 
   But history will cast a very severe judgement if we do not go forward with the purpose of healing the wounds that this episode has caused, and restoring the moral and civil foundation of our political society. 
   I leave my colleagues with the wisdom of James Madison in Federalist Paper 62 when he addressed the important role of the Senate in tempering the actions of the House. ``..... a senate,'' he wrote, ``as a second branch of the legislative assembly, distinct from, and dividing the power with, a first, must be in all cases a salutary check on the government.'' 
   By dismissing these charges against the President, we will have done our duty to provide that salutary check, and we will have taken the first step in restoring the trust and faith of the people of this nation. It is time to do as the American people have asked: end this sad episode and get back to work.

    Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I am taking a major step to force action to help the American steel industry through the current import crisis. Today, I propose that Congress legislate a solution to the problem of illegal steel dumping. I believe that without swift action, the United States' steelworkers will continue to be laid off in near record numbers, and our steelworkers will--not unlike the late 70s and early 80s--permanently lose jobs and that the industry's long term viability will be threatened. The difference between 1998 and what happened a decade or two ago is that this time our steel industry has invested in itself and become the most efficient steel producer in the world. We can take on all comers if we are given a level playing field. Sadly, the strength of our steel industry is now jeopardized, despite its own successful efforts to retool for the next century, because of unfair trade practices and unprecedented levels of imports. I firmly believe the ongoing devastation of our steel industry is unnecessary and a direct result of massive import surges from countries who are seeking to make America the world's importer of last resort. We cannot continue to let our nation's steelworkers bear the brunt of the financial shocks caused by financial mismanagement in Asia or elsewhere in the world. 
   I am joined in introducing this legislation today by my colleagues, Senators SARBANES, BYRD and HOLLINGS. The bill is the ``Stop Illegal Steel Trade Act of 1999.'' This legislation would place restrictions on steel imports for a period of three years in order to return steel imports to a fairer, 20% share of the United States' market. The bill provides the President with the authority to take the necessary steps to ensure that we return to this pre-crisis level--he can impose quotas, tariff surcharges, negotiate enforceable voluntary export restraint agreements, or choose other means to ensure that steel imports in any given month do not exceed the average of steel imports in the United States for the three years prior to July 1997. The bill would be effective within 60 days of enactment. The Secretary of the Treasury, as the head of the United States' Customs Service, and the Secretary of Commerce are charged with implementing, administering, and enforcing the restraints on steel imports. The Customs Service is explicitly authorized to deny entry into the United States any steel products that exceed the allowable level of imports. Volume will be determined on the basis of tonnage. This bill would apply to the following categories of steel products--semifinished, plates, sheets and strips, wire rods, wire and wire products, rail type products, bars, structural shapes and units, pipes and tubes, iron ore and coke. The bill's provisions will expire after 3 years (beginning 60 days from enactment). 
   Right now, imports comprise roughly 30-35% of all steel sold in the United States. Imports of steel mill products in 1998 are expected to exceed 41 million net tons. Over the last year and a half, steel imports have increased by 47%. That high percentage of imports is unsustainable and without quick action I think they will effectively undermine our steel industry's ability to survive. The industry and its workers have responded to this import surge by filing international trade cases against Japan, Russia, and Brazil. The Department of Commerce found critical circumstances exist with respect to those cases and has expedited their consideration. I commend them for doing so, but the trade case only deals with hot-rolled steel. Import surges have occurred in a wide variety of steel imports and if the hot-rolled problem was adequately addressed I think we would just see a new problem with cold-rolled, or plate. 
   I think Congress must act to deal comprehensively with this problem. It should make sure that one category of imports isn't controlled only to find we have a new problem with a new category of steel products. Under the legislation we are introducing today, Japan would be forced to reduce its imports to 2.2 million tons per year down  from the approximately 6.6 million tons of steel they sent to the United States in 1998. Russia, which sent about 5.2 million tons of steel to the United States in 1998, under this bill would be forced to dramatically reduce the amount of steel it ships to the United States. Stemming the import flood from Russia is especially important because the numbers show that the Russians have steadily and significantly increased their exports to the United States over the last several years. Russia exported 1.4 million tons to the United States in 1995, 1.6 million tons in 1996, and 3.3 million tons in 1997. Japan and Russia are two countries which provide a clear illustration of why we need to limit steel imports. Job losses and unfilled order books of steel companies across the country tell us we need to act to stop the flood of imports. But these numbers, which give you an idea as to how much tonnage has increased, make it clear why the United States must guard against the continued import surges in our market from foreign countries seeking to sell to the United States market. Currently, there is no cost for foreign countries to violate our trade laws other than the threat of suit, but our steelworkers, their families and communities are paying a steep price every day for our failure to step in and effectively address the problem. 
   I should note to my colleagues that legislation restricting the level of steel imports was introduced last week in the House of Representatives and it has already garnered over a quarter of its membership as cosponsors. Congressman VISCLOSKY is leading this effort in the House of Representatives and I look forward to working with him and all the House cosponsors who are eager to stand up for steel. 
   Frankly, I have watched and waited for months as this crisis has continued, and as more and more workers have been laid off or placed on short weeks. The number of workers who have been directly affected by this crisis stands at over 10,000 today, but I believe that number could escalate to as many as ten times that figure if we all we continue to do is hope that the crisis will abate on its own. I think it is time to take a leadership role in this crisis and move aggressively to stop the dumping. Under current U.S. law, only the President has the full authority to act immediately to begin the process of an International Trade Commission investigation into this problem of import surges and steel dumping. The ITC's work takes time--anywhere from 120 to 150 days depending on the complexity of the case. I believe what my steelworkers have told me, our industry doesn't have the luxury of time to wait. That's why I have taken this extraordinary step of suggesting that Congress substitute its judgement for Executive action. Effective Executive action could eliminate the need for this Congressional action, but I cannot sit idly by and watch our steel industry take a beating because of unfair foreign competition. 
   For the record, you all should know that West Virginia has a proud history as one of our nation's foremost steel manufacturers. We are the home of Weirton, Wheeling Pittsburgh, Wheeling Nisshin, and Follansbee Steel. West Virginia and its neighboring states are the birthplace of our modern steel industry--an industry that built an industrialized America and launched our nation's prosperity in the beginning of this great century. They forged the metal that brought us through two world wars, built the American economy's manufacturing base and allowed us to lead the world in the transition to the new economy. 
   That is why, when Weirton Steel has laid off 20% of its workforce and is facing losses that it cannot sustain over time, I cannot just hope that trade cases will take care of part of the problem caused by some of the worst offenders. Wheeling Pittsburgh, Wheeling Nisshin, and Follansbee, are making it through these hard times, but they would be that much more prosperous if they weren't dealing with unfair competition. 
   Today I want to share a quote with my colleagues that I believe will provide my colleagues with some important context for this matter and which underscores why I believe that Congress should act:  
   So, Mr. President, it is an extremely timely occasion that my colleagues and I rise to address the Senate on this issue. It is also timely, Mr. President, because the American steel industry is in the midst of its most serious crisis in the postwar era. 
   Yet, at the same time, the steel industry is fundamental to the American economy. It supplies virtually every sector, from automobiles, construction, railroads, shipbuilding, aerospace, defense, oil and gas, agriculture, industrial machinery and equipment, the appliances, utensils and beverage containers. The fortunes of this industry--good or ill--will have a major impact on the rest of the economy. 
   But the purpose a number of us have in speaking today, Mr. President, is to discuss trade; for it is the major component of the current crisis and may prove to be the factor most difficult to control, inasmuch as it is not totally a domestic issue. 
   Trade is also not a new problem. Steel import restraints have been proposed in one form or another since the 1960's. The trigger price mechanism was in effect from 1978 to 1980 and then again in 1981. Although these programs achieved some short-term results, mostly in terms of improving price levels, none of them provided long-term solutions to the growing problems of global overcapacity and the failure of noncompetitive steel industries to adjust. 
   The latter problem has become more and more a factor in the difficulties of the past several years. While we have continued to practice the ethic of the free market system, the Europeans, quite plainly, have not. Subsidies and dumping have increased as European governments attempt to stay in power and forestall social unrest and unemployment by maintaining steel jobs and production at any cost. Hence the tremendous Government subsidies. 
   In the beginning those were social policy decisions any government is entitled to make for itself. However, it has become apparent in the past few years that maintaining steel production through subsidies require substantial exporting in order to unload the excess supply. The chief victim of that export has been the United States, meaning that the European steel process has been at our expense. And that, Mr. President, is unacceptable. 
   It is all well and good for European Community governments to say their steel industry is in bad shape--which it is; or to argue they need time for adjustment--which they do. But their adjustment plans have consistently been behind schedule thanks to foot-dragging by member nation governments, while exports here have increased. I have no intention of explaining to the steelworker in Pittsburgh or Youngstown or Gary or East Chicago that has to give up his job in order to help his Belgian, French, or Italian colleague to keep his. My responsibility, the responsibility of the Senate, the responsibility of the administration, is to our own people--to take those actions which will be good for them both in the long term and in the short term. 
   That responsibility does not preclude compromise, and it does not preclude a recognition that steel is a global industry where multilateral solutions may be necessary and appropriate. In fact, I think there is much to be said for an international steel agreement which would include limits on financing new capacity in third countries, guidelines on adjustment, and, if necessary, global import restraints. But progress in that direction must begin with a recognition of where the problems are and whose responsibility it is to begin fixing them. And, as I said in this Chamber last Thursday, the responsibility in this case--both legal and economic--is clear. 
   European steel subsidies violate both U.S. law and international agreements which the European Community member nations have signed. We went through five years of negotiations to produce those agreements. On our part we made significant, substantive, concessions, like the abolition of the American selling price, the wine-gallon-proof-gallon system, and the acceptance of an injury test in subsidy cases. What we seem to have received in return was a lot of promises. Promises to adhere to the discipline of the codes that had been negotiated. Promises to reduce or eliminate subsidies, dumping, and other unfair trade practices. Promises to open up Government procurement. 
   We accepted all those promises. Mr. President, because they contained the hope of greater discipline over unfair trade practices and the hope of more markets for American products. And we accepted them because we believe in a free market system that functions according to the prescribed rules that all parties adhere to. Promoting those rules has been the essence of our trade policy ever since, and I for one believe that should continue to be our policy. 
   But I must say, Mr. President, that in the intervening years since 1979 when we finished negotiating the Tokyo round and enacted the Trade Agreements Act of that year, I have heard a lot from the people in this country injured by the concessions we made in the Tokyo round and very little from anyone who has gained by those agreements. And now, the system we sought to establish at that time faces its most serious test. Simply put, the European Community and its member states do not want to accept the responsibilities they agreed to undertake in 1979. They do not want the rules enforced. They do not want to make the hard economic decisions about their own steel industry that the market requires them to make. 
   They would rather export their unemployment to the United States. They are screaming very loud about our efforts to hold them  not only to their word, but to the letter and spirit of international law. Mr. President, despite the screams, despite the alleged serious consequences to trade relations, this is a test we must meet, because both our own industry and the international trading system, one based on the concept of free and fair trade, are at stake. 
   I need say no more about the desperate situation in our steel industry. Those of us with steel facilities in our State see it every time we return home. Not to defend our own industry, particularly when it is consistent with our own law and with our international obligations to do so, is to turn an already serious situation into a major disaster. It is also to abandon the people who elected us. 
   There is an issue here beyond the survival of the American steel industry, Mr. President. That is the survival of a fair and equitable trading system based on mutually acceptable rules of the game. Some people in this country bemoan the revival of the days of the Smoot-Hawley tariff or a return to the ``begger-thy-neighbor'' policies of years ago every time anyone in Congress starts to talk about imports being a problem. 
   Mr. President, no one, including me--most specifically me--wants to return to that era of depression, but to avoid it, we must understand the reason for it. That reason, in my judgement, was the failure at that time to develop an international trading system based on free market principles, based on the theory of comparative advantage, based on universally accepted rules for participation in that system. 
   Mr. President, this country was a great leader in during and after World War II. In 1943, our leaders of the free world went to Bretton Woods, N.H., and at Bretton Woods, we developed a system with exactly those goals in mind that I just mentioned. At Bretton Woods, we developed that system and we have maintained it ever since, at least up to now. Now we face problems more intractable, a world more complex, and power more diffused than ever before. The old solutions seem to be losing their attractiveness in favor of even older solutions, a return to the mercantilist policies of the past. 
   Mr. President, that is what is at stake in this controversy. Not just our steel industry, and not just the European steel industry, important though they both are. It is the survival of a free world trading system that is the issue, because it cannot survive unless nations are willing to accept their responsibilities and their subsidies. 
   Mr. President, I state this not only to send a message to the European Community, but also to make it clear to others in our own Government that we in Congress hold very strong views on this matter. We in Congress wrote this law. We in Congress made it tough on purpose--precisely to prevent the kind of devastating unfair trade practices and actions that we are experiencing right now in steel. 
   Today it is steel, tomorrow, it may be some other product, it may be some other set of States, it may be some other industries. 
   I say, Mr. President, that it is terribly important that the law continue to work now against those kinds of unfair trade actions. 
   So far the law is working to stop that action. It is absolutely essential that we let it continue to work and not seek some expedient end to the matter that might make for short-term peace at the bargaining table but will produce long-term chaos in the international trading system. 
   It is not ``protectionist'' to take action against such patently unfair practices. In fact, to fail to do so would compromise the principles of free trade which are central to the international trade agreement both we and the Europeans signed. 
   We must send a strong message to our trading partners that the United States expects fair trade in our markets and the vigorous enforcement of our trade laws, and I urge the Secretary of Commerce to hold to that course.  
   That quote is from a statement delivered on the Senate floor on July 26, 1982 by the late Senator John Heinz from the great steel state of Pennsylvania. He made it when he introduced legislation to deal with the problems facing the steel industry during the early 1980s. We've heard a lot about Yogi Beara lately, but I think this statement says ``the more things change, the more they remain the same.'' Our trade dilemma remains the same today. 
   We survived the crises in the late 70s and 80s because our industry, its workers, and their elected representatives acted. The industry needed to streamline and heavily invest in capital improvements. It needed to become leaner, and more efficient. The hard transitions we made as a direct result of action and sacrifice by our steelworkers and their families. Steel technology dramatically improved because the industry invested $50 billion of its own money. Cost of production decreased. The United States' steel industry has the lowest number of man hours per ton of any steel producer in the world. Today, we can make steel better, cheaper, and cleaner than any of our competitors, bar none. But it cost 300,000 steelworkers their jobs. After all that, the one thing we cannot compromise is that we have to have a level playing field on which we can compete. No one can compete when the competition sells below the cost of production and dumps steel in massive amounts onto our market--not even the American steel industry. 
   Short of a handful of trade cases, and tough talk to trading partners who have shown little intention of caring what our stance will be, little has been done to stop the illegal dumping. If after all that agony of transforming itself into the most efficient steel producer in the world we are still trying to tell our industry that they have to take it on the chin against illegal imports--that our unfair trade laws can't protect their ability to compete on the world market--then many who hope to continue to grow our economy through expanded trade will be sorely surprised by the reaction of an American public that does not see the benefits of trade. 
   I want the United States to push to continue to open new markets for our exports. I think that only makes good economic sense. I very much want a fair and free international trading system. But I think we have to insist that everyone has to play by the rules. This bill says that if our trading partners won't play by the rules, then Congress will see to it that our industry isn't unduly disadvantaged--to me, that only seems fair. 
   I urge all my colleagues to join on as cosponsors. We can do this, together.

    Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, today I am pleased to introduce the Air Service Restoration Act of 1999, together with my colleagues Senators DORGAN, WYDEN, HARKIN and BINGAMAN. 
   In the past several years there has been a growing debate in the Congress and across the nation about the state of our aviation industry. The primary concerns heard again and again are that a decline in air service to small and rural communities and increasing consolidation among airlines and in certain essential markets are hurting consumers and stifling economic development. 
   I know these concerns well from the experience of my home State of West Virginia. By virtually any measure West Virginia is the State that has been hardest hit by air service declines in the twenty years since deregulation. With the notable exception of a few important upgrades and new opportunities in the last year, West Virginia's air service has been far inferior to that provided other communities--the planes are uncomfortable, the prices are high, and the schedules are thin and subject to frequent cancellations. As a result, at a time when the rest of the nation has experienced a 75 percent increase in air traffic, passenger enplanements statewide in West Virginia have declined by nearly 40 percent. 
   The real tragedy of poor air service isn't passenger inconvenience or frustration, however, it's the negative impact on economic development. In today's global marketplace air service has become the single most important mode of transportation. When it comes to economic growth, there is no substitute for good air service, and the lack of quality, affordable service can and does hold us back, stunting economic growth in West Virginia just as it does in small and rural communities across the country. We must act now to stem this tide--to restore and promote air service to under-served areas--or we will never be able to close the gap in a meaningful and sustained way. 
   This legislation is designed not only to build on the successes of airline deregulation but also to take responsibility for its failures. It contains four major provisions: 
   First, the centerpiece of the bill is a five-year $100 million pilot program for up to 40 small and under-served communities, with grants of up to $500,000 to each community for local initiatives to attract and promote service. 
   Second, the Department of Transportation would have the authority to facilitate links between pilot communities and major airports by requiring joint fares and interline agreements between dominant airlines at hub airports and new service 
   providers at under-served airports. 
   Third, to address a key infrastructure concern of small and rural airports, the bill establishes a pilot program allowing communities facing the loss of an air traffic control tower to instead share the cost of funding the tower, on a contract basis, in proportion to the cost-benefit ratio of the tower. 
   Fourth, the bill calls on the Department of Transportation to review airline industry marketing practices--practices which many believe are exacerbating the decline in air service to small communities--and, if necessary, promulgate regulations to curb abuses. 
   The legislation we introduce today should begin to afford small and rural community air service the priority they deserve in our national transportation policy. It is similar to a bill I and my colleagues introduced last year, many provisions of which were adopted by the full Senate in the failed FAA and AIP reauthorization bill of 1998. Variations on some of these provisions have also been included in the 1999 reauthorization bill introduced last month by Senators MCCAIN, HOLLINGS, GORTON and myself. I am hopeful that we will successfully enact this legislation, to protect and restore small community air service, this year. 
   Admittedly, airline deregulation has been a real success story in much of the nation, with lower fares, better service, and more choices for many passengers, as well as tremendous financial success and stability for commercial airlines. But as I have said in the past, airline deregulation has handed out the benefits of air travel unevenly, and we face today an ever-widening gap between the air transportation ``haves'' and ``have-nots''. We in the Congress have a responsibility to foster and maintain a truly national air transportation system, and we fail our small and rural communities when we leave them with the choice between high-cost, poor-quality service or no service at all. 
   This legislation and this year offer a real opportunity to re-double our efforts to connect small and rural communities to our air transportation system in a meaningful way. I commend the efforts of Senators DORGAN, WYDEN, HARKIN and BINGAMAN to solve this daunting national problem, and I hope our colleagues will join us in the endeavor.

    Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I would like to join Senator FRIST and other distinguished colleagues in introducing the Federal Research Investment Act. This legislation will set a long-term vision for federal funding of research and development programs so that the United States can continue to be the world leader in high-tech industries. 
   One only needs to look as far as the front page of the newspaper to see the effect of high-technology on our country. New drugs are becoming available for fighting cancer; new communication hardware is allowing more people to connect to the internet; and advances in fuel-cell technology are leading to low-emission, high-efficiency alternative fuel vehicles. In fact, seventy percent of all patent applications cite non-profit or federally-funded research as a core component to the innovation being patented. People are living longer, with a higher quality of life, in a better economy due to processes, procedures, and equipment which are based on federally-funded research. 
   What I am afraid of is that many people are not aware that these products do not simply appear out of nowhere. They are the result of a basis of knowledge which has been built up by researchers supported by federal funding. American companies pull from this knowledge base in order to develop the latest high-tech products which you and I read about in the paper and see on our store shelves every day. 
   I view this knowledge base as a bank. The U.S. government puts in modest amounts of funding in the form of support for scientific research. The payback comes from the economic growth which is produced as this knowledge is turned into actual products by American companies. 
   In fact, a large part of the current rosy economic situation is due to our dominant high-tech industries. High-tech companies are currently responsible for one-third of our economic output and half of our economic growth. However, if we are to continue at this pace, we need to support the fundamental, pre-competitive research critical to these industries, at the necessary levels, and in a stable manner from year to year, and we need to do so now. 
   In the last session of the 105th Congress Senators FRIST, BINGAMAN, DOMENICI, GRAMM, BREAUX, BURNS, and I introduced S. 2217, the Federal Research Investment Act, and previous to that Senators DOMENICI and BINGAMAN, introduced S. 1305, the National Research Investment Act. Both S. 1305 and S. 2217 have been extremely successful in galvanizing members of the scientific and engineering community to pull together and work constructively towards a common ideal. In addition, it has brought together the co-sponsors of these bills and moved them forward as a group with their original idea. S. 2217 passed without dissent in the Senate at the end of last session, and gained 36 co-sponsors--18 Democrats and 18 Republicans. Our aim, in re-introducing the Federal Research Investment Act, is to now take the next step in this process, bringing to fruition the goals of our bill. 
   The Federal Research Investment Act is a long-term vision for federal R&D funding. It creates legislative language which stresses the importance of R&D funding to the strength of our nation's innovation infrastructure. It also sets out guidelines for Congress to use in prioritizing funding decisions. 
   Just three years ago, federal science funding was in a serious decline and fewer than half a dozen members of Congress gave it any attention, but now as a significant consequence of both S. 1305 and S. 2217 the trend, at least in the last two years, seems to have reversed and a universal spirit of cooperation for strong R&D funding is developing on all fronts. In the last two years the science budget has increased above inflation. In particular, for Fiscal Year 1999, an unprecedented 10% increase in civilian R&D funding was appropriated. Yet, we appear to be in a crisis situation once again due to unexpected budgetary constraints resulting from last year's appropriations. Thus, we need to continue our fight to implement the R&D budgetary guidelines in our bill. This uncertainty in the level of R&D funding from year to year can be as detrimental to the health of the scientific enterprise as a lack of adequate funding levels. It will be a sad day for our nation, and its future economic prosperity, if we manage to lose what progress we have made to date. 
   Based on a careful review and analysis of our past history, our bill authorizes an annual funding increase of 5.5%, starting in the year 2000 and going through 2010, for federally-funded, civilian, R&D programs. This would increase federal R&D spending to 2.6% of total, overall budget by 2010, a near doubling in R&D funding from 1998 levels. In order to make sure that these increases are fully incorporated into budgetary process we request that the President include these increases in his annual budget request to Congress. 
   We are currently in an economic upturn. This continues to be a perfect  time to increase funding for R&D so that we can continue this growth. I have faith that, as long as the economic situation allows it, my thoughtful and wise colleagues will support increasing R&D funding to the levels that we have laid out in this bill. However, I am also a realist. I realize that the economy may not always remain as strong as it is right now. That is why we have introduced a funding firewall. Without this firewall I am seriously concerned that history will repeat itself. In the past, R&D funding is one of the first things that has been cut during times of crisis. This is the wrong approach. I believe that cutting R&D funding levels below a bare minimum level causes serious, long-term harm to the R&D infrastructure in the United States. Our firewall would not allow this to happen. It is not meant as a goal, it is meant as a bare minimum which should only be implemented in the leanest of years. 
   Many, if not most, recent `quantum leaps' in knowledge have occurred at the interface between traditional disciplines of research. Therefore, we legislatively mandate that this funding increase must be macroscopically balanced, so that there is not preferential growth of one agency, program or field of study at the expense of other, equally qualified and deserving agencies. One of the original reasons that I started to get involved with technology issues such as EPSCoR and EPSCoT, was because I believe that technology should be shared by everyone, not just those in Silicon Valley or the Route 128 corridor in Boston. Therefore, this bill should not be seen as a means of promoting elitist science but as a mechanism for allowing for diversity in our national innovation infrastructure. 
   Finally, so that we are able to assure other Members of Congress and the general public that this money authorized by this Act would be well spent, we have included accountability measures which will assure that there is no waste of federal money on out-dated, or ill-conceived projects. This bill puts into place a system of accountability for each affected agency. Our bill institutes a study by the National Academy of Sciences to determine how to effectively measure the progress of R&D based agencies and then have them institute performance measures based on these metrics. This will allow increases in funding without concerns over wasteful spending being generated. 
   In conclusion, with the help of Senators GRAMM, LIEBERMAN, DOMENICI, and BINGAMAN, Senator FRIST and I have put together a long-term vision for federal R&D funding which we hope will instigate real increases in federal funding for research and development. Federally-funded research has been, and will continue to be, a driving power behind our economic success. If we are to maintain and enhance our current economic prosperity we must make sure that research programs are funded at adequate levels in a consistent long-term manner. I urge my colleagues to support this bill.

   Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation which will help the President deal with the flood of dirt-cheap steel imports from our trading partners. I introduce this legislation with the full knowledge that there are many actions required to respond to the steel import crisis that is corroding the United States' steel industry's ability to compete. This crisis is hurting our steelworkers and our companies. It must be dealt with as a top priority in the 106th Congress. 
   The bill I am introducing today deals with two important aspects of this crisis: monitoring imports and remedying injury to domestic industries under our trade laws. The bill has two main parts. The first section reforms Section 201 of the Trade Act of 1974 to conform its standard of injury to that of our world trading partners. This reform will affect all products which are covered by Section 201 by revising the U.S. standard for injury to the standard used in the World Trade Organization's Safeguards Code. The second section of the bill will help us better track steel imports by requiring an import permit for steel and establishing a monitoring program. This will allow us to track steel imports, as many of our trading partners currently have the ability to do. It will provide import data in a more timely fashion and help us better anticipate future import problems. I am proposing the ``Trade Fairness Act of 1999'' along with my colleague and Senate Steel Caucus co-chair, Senator SPECTER, in order to strengthen the President's ability to help domestic industries receive the relief they need and deserve when imports are a cause of serious injury, and so we know what when significant amounts of foreign steel are entering our country. 
   Import relief is what the U.S. steel industry desperately needs right now. This bill contains provisions that will help us more effectively deal with future import problems, but it will not provide the immediate assistance that our steel industry needs to survive this crisis. Within a matter of days, we will have the steel import data from the end of last quarter. I fully expect it will show that the United States is still enduring an unprecedented level of steel imports. I also strongly believe that most of those imports continue to be sold at historically low prices; prices which are below the cost of actual production in many instances. American steel manufacturers cannot fight this unfair trade practice without help. West Virginia and other major steel makers deserve help now, before it is too late. This measure addresses some of the structural reforms needed to deal with import surges in the future, but, again, I have to admit it won't do what's needed to stop the flood of steel imports. I firmly believe that a 201 action is what is required, now, to stop the imports. I have strenuously made that case to the Administration, and will continue to make that case to the President and his advisors, as well as my colleagues on the Finance Committee, and in the Congress. I am also likely to submit other legislative remedies to deal with the emergency which faces the United States' steel industry and its workers. 
   This legislation I am introducing today includes reforms we need to improve the way U.S. trade laws function in a crisis. The import licensing will help the steel industry specifically, but the Section 201 reforms will ultimately benefit all products where foreign competitors have dumped their product on the American market. I intend to push these provisions during the Finance Committee's consideration of trade legislation in the 106th Congress. The 201 reforms will improve our ability to remedy harm against domestic industries and at the same time remain consistent with rules we expect our world trading partners to live by. We can be tough and fair on trade at the same time and the bill I am introducing today proves it. 
   In my state of West Virginia, our two largest steel manufacturers, Weirton Steel and Wheeling Pittsburgh Steel, have been hit hard by the steel import crisis. Weirton alone has laid off over 900 workers and there is the possibility that their fourth quarter earnings and order book could force these two companies to consider additional lay offs in the near future. Wheeling-Pittsburgh is also worried about the effect of the crisis on their bottom-line. Laying off workers is never easy, but this crisis is forcing hard decisions. West Virginia steel makers are producing world-class products as efficiently as any foreign competitor, but when foreign competitors are blatantly dumping their product at prices which are sometimes actually below the cost of production,  it cuts the legs out from under American companies. Such unfair practices are absolutely unacceptable. U.S. industry--the U.S. steel industry and other industries--deserve just remedies when competitors unfairly dump their product on the U.S. market. We want to give the President the policy tools he needs to deal with unfair import competition. 
   Import data tells the story of a worsening steel crisis--the first two quarters of 1998 have shown a 27% increase in imports of hot-rolled steel. Japanese imports increased by an astounding 114% in that same time frame. Steel imports from South Korea increased 90%. There is no end in sight. Russia and Brazil are other prime offenders. A trade case is pending against the imports of hot-rolled steel from Russia, Brazil and Japan. The Commerce Department made a determination of critical circumstances in regard to that case. More cases are expected. 
   The real tragedy of this crisis is that the U.S. steel industry has spent over a decade reinventing itself, adjusting and modernizing, in order to become a top-notch competitor as we approach the 21st century. This industry is a true success story--productivity has shot up and we can beat any producer in the world on price and quality when provided with a level playing field. For decades, I have worked with leaders in the steel industry at Weirton Steel, Wheeling-Pittsburgh, Wheeling-Nisshin, and others. I have watched and encourage these steelmakers and unions working together to make the tough, necessary decision to modernize. 
   Unfortunately, just as United States steel manufacturers are realizing the gains of such investments, they are facing a flood of imported steel being sold at rock bottom prices--again, below the cost of production in some instances. We cannot compete against that kind of unfair competition. The legislation Senator SPECTER and I are introducing today will both allow us to 
   more efficiently track steel imports and give the President an improved tool to ensure that when there is serious injury as a result of imports, the U.S. can respond. 
   Specifically, the legislation I introduce today with Senator SPECTER will reform Section 201 of our trade law and require import licensing for steel which is classified under Chapters 72 or 73 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States. 
   Let me lay each of the bill's two major provisions in a little more detail. 
   First, Section 201, which this legislation will strengthen, permits the President to grant domestic industries import relief in circumstances where imports are the substantial cause of serious injury. 
   Under current law, domestic industries must show that increased imports are the ``substantial cause'' of serious injury--which means a cause that is important and not less than any other cause. This imposes an unfair, higher burden of proof on domestic industries than is required to prove injury under World Trade Organization standards. The Safeguards Code of the World Trade Organization was established to make sure that fair trade did not mean countries had to put up with unfair practices. The WTO standard requires only that there be a causal link between increased imports and serious injury. I believe that U.S. law should not impose a tougher standard for American companies of harm than the WTO uses for the international community. Applying the WTO standard is responsible and reasonable. In this bill, we propose to establish the same standard for the U.S. as is used by the WTO. Free trade must mean fair trade. 
   In addition, in this bill we also intend to conform U.S. law to the standard in the WTO Safeguards Code when considering the overall test for judging when there has been serious harm to a domestic industry. We clarify that the International Trade Commission (ITC) should review the overall condition of the domestic industry in determining the degree of that injury by making it clear that it is the effect of the imports on the overall state of the industry that counts, not solely the effect on any one of the particular criteria used in the evaluation. 
   Many of our trade partners, like Canada and Mexico, have more modern systems to track imports than we do in the United States. This legislation addresses that problem and provides us with better and more timely data on imports. Explicitly, this legislation requires that within 30 days of the enactment of this legislation, that the Secretary of Commerce, in consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury, will establish an import permit and monitoring program which applies to any one importing a product under chapter 72 or 73 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States that is initially entered into a bonded warehouse or foreign trade zone. Steel import permits will be required before the merchandise is entered into the customs territory of the United States. These permits will be valid for 30 days. The data collected from this permit program will be compiled in aggregate form and be made publicly available on a weekly basis and posted on an Internet site. The Administration already proposed releasing import data earlier and publicly as part of its January, 1999, report to Congress on steel. This legislation will complement that proposal. The Secretary of Commerce will be able to impose reasonable fees to defray the costs of this program. 
   It is our sincere hope that Congress will enact this legislation as part of trade legislation that moves in the 106th Congress. Passage of this legislation will send the message that the United States will fight for the right of its industries to compete on a level playing field in world trade. If imports flood our markets, we will act to protect American industries against the consequences. 
   I am someone who adamantly believes the promotion of free trade is essential to our country's continued economic growth. If we are to continue to expand the trade base of our economy we need U.S. industry to know that we will keep it fair. American industry and American workers can deal with fair trade, but they shouldn't be asked to sit still for unfair trade practices that hurt workers and their families, while robbing the profit-margins of U.S. companies. 
   I intend to work in the 106th Congress, with my colleagues on the Finance Committee and those in the Administration responsible for trade policy, to give the President better, more effective tools to ensure that our country can insist trade be free and fair. Our steel industry, indeed all U.S. industries, deserve no less. But this legislation alone will not remedy the steel crisis our country faces. Rest assured, I will continue to carefully review my legislative options and take other appropriate actions in the near future to help fight this important crisis.

   Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, today, I join with Senator MCCAIN, Senator HOLLINGS and others in introducing legislation to authorize spending for the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) through fiscal year 2000. As we embark on this new session of a new Congress, it is critical that we begin immediately the process of putting together a comprehensive aviation bill--to ensure that the FAA is fully authorized, to facilitate continued critical airport development, and to address a number of broad aviation policy matters. 
   I want to make clear at the outset that I join as a cosponsor of this bill as a starting point. Senator MCCAIN plans to pursue vigorously a comprehensive bill, and that will be our first order of business, but haste may not allow us to do all that we want and have a responsibility to do, particularly if the House continues to pursue its own clean, 6-month reauthorization bill, and then a long-term bill. I am hopeful that we will accomplish our objectives expeditiously, but I see any number of hurdles in our path and believe that in the Senate, too, we may need to pursue a short-term extension and then give this legislation the consideration it is due. 
   As my colleagues know, I have the honor in this Congress of following in the great foot steps of Wendell Ford, who served this body for 24 years, and served as Chairman and Ranking Member of the Aviation Subcommittee for as long as any of us can remember. In fact, the bill being introduced today, essentially the same bill that passed the Senate last year, honored the Senator by naming it the Wendell H. Ford Air Transportation Safety Improvement Act, at the unanimously-endorsed suggestion of Senator TED STEVENS. 
   In stepping into Senator Ford's shoes, I aim to ensure not only that the aviation needs of West Virginia and other rural states and communities are secured, but also that the needs of the nation and of my colleagues' constituents are addressed. Certainly there will be competing interests and sometimes conflicts, but we all must and share in the fundamental responsibility to maintain safety in the skies, to support fully the needs of the aviation system and modernization effort, to ensure that the industry provides the service our constituents demand and deserve, to facilitate stable funding sources for our airports, and to be vigilant in opening up markets for our air carriers worldwide. These are all daunting tasks but we are up to the challenge, and I look forward to working with the Chairman, and members of the Committee in crafting an aviation bill that we can all take pride in. 
   The bill before you is a place to begin our discussion. 
   Last year, the Congress was able to pass only a six-month extension of the Airport Improvement Program (AIP), effectively freezing half of the $1.95 billion allocated to the program. Absent a reauthorization, our airports and our constituents may lose the ability to upgrade a runway or start an expansion project that facilitates new business opportunities for our communities--all because we're having trouble figuring out a way out of the box we are in. Senator MCCAIN's resolve notwithstanding, our House counterparts have already favorably reported a clean, 6-month extension of the program. Even if we can reach agreement about our immediate needs, I do not want the Senate to pass a bill only to see the program lapse because our House colleagues refuse to consider anything other than a clean, short-term extension, before the March deadline, saving the major issues and a long-term bill for later in the year. The blame-game that would ensue would only harm the citizens who sent us here. We can get more slots, we can work to improve service to small communities, we can make sure the FAA has the ability to move forward with its modernization plans, but it will not happen overnight. 
   Let me give you but one example. Senator GORTON last year offered an amendment in the Commerce Committee that would have raised the passenger facility charge (PFC) from $3 per enplanement to $4. I supported Senator GORTON. I expect that he will again try to raise the PFC, and the Administration has indicated that they will propose an increase as well. This is a tough issue, pitting the carriers against the airports, and letting some claim that it is a new tax. However, another dollar could get us a lot more capacity at our nation's airports. 
   In front of us are the daunting future needs of the aviation system. All of the projections show that we will have 300 million more passengers by the year 2009. As much as I would like them all to flow through West Virginia, I know that all of our airports will face constraints--money is tight, and a PFC increase will help. How the PEC is structured, the types of controls possible, and what they are used for, are all difficult choices, and I want to work with the airports and the carriers to try to carriers to try to resolve this issue in a balanced way. 
   The air traffic control system also needs to be revamped. It is a complex system and each new system requires changes in the cockpit, new procedures and new avionics--change, therefore, that cannot happen overnight. GAO recently reported that the FAA is making progress, changing the way it does business and working with the industry to figure out what is needed. GAO also reports that the FAA will need $17 billion to complete the modernization effort. Without that degree of funding, we may not be able to get all we want--new computers, new ways to move aircraft, and more capacity to make the system safer. According to the National Civil Aviation Review Commission, unless we address this problem, we are facing gridlock in the skies. 
   So, funding of the FAA is a critical, critical matter. I know Congressman SHUSTER wants to take the Airport and Airways Trust Fund off budget, but what I found last year is that the offset for taking trust funds can be devastating to totally unrelated programs. Right now, I know that the FAA is supported not only by the Trust Fund revenues, but also a large contribution from the general fund, which should be continued in recognition of the important public benefits provided by aviation. 
   Finally, I know that the administration will be submitting its legislative proposal to us within the next few weeks. We need to take a careful look at those recommendations, and sit down with Secretary Slater and Administrator Garvey to develop a blue print for the future. We have an opportunity this year to make some real changes. I do not want it to pass us by.
