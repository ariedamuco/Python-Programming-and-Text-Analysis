Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I want to add my voice to those supporting the passage of the Vacancies Reform Act as part of this bill. The Vacancies Reform Act addresses an enormously important issue: the need to protect the Senate's constitutional role in the appointment of Federal officers. The Constitution provides that the President's power to appoint officers of the United States is to be exercised `by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate.' Unfortunately, in too many cases, over the course of the past several Administrations, the Senate's constitutional prerogatives have been ignored, through the Executive's far too common practice of appointing acting officials to serve lengthy periods in positions that are supposed to be filled with individuals confirmed by the Senate. 
With the leadership of Senators Byrd and Thompson, we in the Governmental Affairs Committee have worked for a large part of this session to try to find a solution to this problem that reasserted the Senate's constitutional rights while at the same time avoided creating an unwarranted risk to the Government's good functioning. As noted in the Additional Views I and others signed to the committee's report, the bill the committee reported in July and the Senate considered in September went most of the way toward achieving these goals. Nevertheless, because it still contained a number of troubling provisions that, in my view, could have hindered the ability of the executive branch to carry out its duties, I could not in the end support that version of the bill. 
Since the bill's floor consideration in September, all of the interested parties have worked hard and in good faith to address the concerns that remained about the bill, with the result that we now have a good bill, one that offers a measured and appropriate response to the Executive's longstanding unwillingness to comply with the dictates of the Vacancies Act. I am particularly pleased that the final version of the bill resolves one of my biggest concerns--that we not define who may serve as an acting official in a manner that, in some cases, effectively precludes anyone from serving in an acting capacity. The final version of the bill well addresses this problem by offering the President the option to choose any senior agency staff who has worked at the agency for at least 90 days to serve as the acting official. 
So, Mr. President, let me once again thank Senator Byrd, Senator Thompson, and the others who have worked so hard on this bill. I am pleased that it soon will become law.

Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I speak today in support of the American Competitiveness and Workforce Improvement Act, which is included in the Conference Report on H.R. 4328, the Omnibus Appropriations Act, under Division C, Title IV. The House passed this Act as H.R. 3736 on September 24. The Senate had passed the companion bill, S. 1723, on May 18. I cosponsored the Senate bill because I believe strongly that the U.S. Government's job is to make sure that U.S. industry has adequate access to the resources necessary to grow their business. Right now we have the lowest unemployment rate in 28 years. The high-tech sector, which has been the engine of growth in our economy--creating the most jobs--cannot find enough skilled workers. If U.S. industry needs more skilled workers than the U.S. labor force can provide, as the Department of Commerce has documented, then we must allow them to hire foreign skilled workers, and, as is more often the case, allow them to hire foreign graduate students educated here in the United States. These foreign workers create wealth and more jobs in this country. If we block these visas the research will go abroad. 
The Semiconductor Research Corporation, founded by the U.S. semiconductor industry, supports approximately 800 graduate students each year with merit-based scholarships. Some of the students receiving grants are foreigners studying here in the United States. They told me that this year, for the first time, they have been unable to hire all of the graduate students whose research they funded, even though the students wished to remain in the United States, because they cannot get H-1B visas. 
When I cosponsored S. 1723 in May, I believed it was a good bill because it not only temporarily increased the number of visas available for skilled workers, but it also set up education and training programs for Americans so that more U.S. workers will soon be eligible for these high-paying jobs in the high-tech sector. I am delighted to say that I believe the bill that emerged from the long and detailed negotiation between Senator Abraham and the White House is now even better legislation. The American Competitiveness and Workforce Improvement Act increases the number of visas available for the next three years, includes funding to decrease processing time for visa applications, and funds education and training programs to increase the pool of skilled workers in the United States. For the benefit of workers, it includes substantial protections for U.S. workers, increases enforcement authority for the Department of Labor to protect workers rights, and creates additional protections for H1-B employees. These new protections will help eliminate real and/or perceived hiring practices that came under criticism and made this such a controversial visa program. Removing the opportunity for abuse of the program makes its a stronger program and broadens its base of support. This act is in the best interests of both U.S. and foreign workers and U.S. business. 
The funding that is included in this act is vitally important. Too often, Congress passes legislation with the result that executive branch agencies or States are expected to provide more services and programs with less money. This act funds each of the programs it creates and the increased duties it requires of government agencies with a fee on each visa. It funds K-12 science programs. It funds scholarships in the math, science and engineering fields. And it funds training in high-tech skills. 
I would like to speak in particular about the training program contained in the American Competitiveness and Workforce Improvement Act, Section 414 (c). As the chief sponsor of this provision, I want in these remarks to particularly address the intent and meaning of the provision. Section 414 (c) directs the Secretary of Labor to establish demonstration projects to provide technical skills training for workers. What makes this program unique is not just that it is targeted at technical skills, but that it will be open to both employed and unemployed workers. 
Most Department of Labor training programs are solely for unemployed, displaced or disadvantaged workers. But in today's market, technology changes so quickly that no longer can people be trained in their twenties and expect to use those same skills throughout their career. American workers used to have one job for life. Now the average American will have five to ten jobs in a lifetime. Employees need to update their skills continually to remain competitive. Realistically, we must allow Department of Labor training programs to include workers who have jobs now, and want to upgrade and update their skills so they can qualify for the changing needs of industry, instead of waiting until they lose their job or become dislocated workers from a declining industry. 
The United States is in the enviable situation at this time of having under 5% unemployment. The high-tech industry tells us it has as many as 190,000 unfilled jobs. This does not necessarily mean that we do not have the people to fill those jobs; it means we don't have the people who have the skills to fill those jobs. Nearly seven out of ten employers say that the high school graduates they see are not yet ready to succeed in the workplace. 
The jobs in the high-tech sector pay more than other jobs. The average wage in the high-tech sector pays 73% more than the average wage in the private sector. The average high-tech manufacturing wage is 32% higher than the U.S. manufacturing average wage. We need to help our citizens get the training they need to get these higher paying jobs. 
The reality is that we have a global economy and there is, more and more, a global workforce. If companies cannot find skilled workers in the United States, they will find them in another country. This training program will help U.S. workers get the skills they need to stay competitive. 
I want to explain my intent for the program established under Section 414 (c). I intend this program to be used for innovative approaches to solving our labor skills shortage; specifically, consortia and community-based programs. I intend the program to be used as a catalyst to bring small and medium sized businesses together to set up cooperative programs of skills training. I believe the best results can be gained from industry-driven programs. To have industry involved in and leading the skills training will ensure that workers are being trained for jobs that actually exist. 
Ninety-nine percent of the 23 million businesses in the United States are small businesses. But, small businesses often do not have the resources to operate training programs by themselves. By joining together in consortia of other small and medium sized businesses with similar labor needs, with the Local Workforce Investment Boards established by the Workforce Investment Partnership Act signed into law this year, with community colleges, or labor organizations, or with State or local governments, small and medium sized businesses can participate in training courses that will increase the labor pool of skilled workers needed in their region. 
Companies, however, do not normally cooperate in training workers. That is why the government is needed to provide the catalyst to bring companies together to cooperate on training. It is expected that the fee from the visas will generate approximately $50 million annually for the training program. It is my hope that the Secretary of Labor will consider, as she establishes these programs, requiring matching funds from the consortia. Nothing in this act precludes such matching funds. Matching funds will help ensure that the companies take an active role in the training program. The Secretary of Labor has the discretion to undertake this implementation approach. Of course, available federal funds are meant only to start the process--federal funding would end over time after which the consortia would continue the cooperative training programs alone. 
Mr. President, let me give some examples of the type of program I am discussing. In the last few years, a small number of regional and industry-based training alliances in the United States have emerged, usually in partnership with state and local governments and technical colleges, that exemplify the type of program on which this provision in the manager's amendment is modeled. In Rhode Island, with help from the state's Human Resource Investment Council, regional plastics firms developed a skills alliance which then worked with a local community college to create a polymer training laboratory linked to an apprenticeship program that guarantees jobs for graduates. The Wisconsin Regional Training Partnership, a consortium of metal-working firms in conjunction with the AFL-CIO, refitted an abandoned mill with state-of-the-art manufacturing equipment to teach workers essential metal-working skills. In Washington, DC, telecommunications firms donated computers and helped set up a program to train public high school students to be computer network administrators. They then hired graduates of the program at entry-level salaries of $25,000-$30,000. 
Without some kind of support to create alliances, such as created by the new provision in this act, small and medium sized firms just don't have the time or resources to collaborate on training. In fact, almost all the existing regional skills alliances report that they would not have been able to get off the ground without an independent staff entity, such as a college or labor organization, to operate the alliance. Widespread and timely deployment of these kinds of partnerships is simply not likely to happen without the incentives established by a federal initiative, which is created by this act. The training provision in the American Competitiveness and Workforce Improvement Act can help create successful new training models and templates that others can replicate across the nation. 
I want to thank Senator Abraham and Lee Liberman Otis and Stuart Anderson of his staff who worked tirelessly to ensure that the American Competitiveness and Workforce Improvement Act would pass the 105th Congress. I also want to thank Laureen Daly of my staff for all her dedicated efforts on this essential legislation. 
We have accomplished something important for our workforce needs and for training in this legislation.

 Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, it gives me great pleasure today to recognize the dedication of Mr. Jack Hechler, who for the past decade has served as an interpreter and escort for an annual Congressional exchange program; the U.S. Congress/Bundestag Staff Exchange. 
This highly successful program has been in existence since 1983 and serves as a guideline to staff exchanges around the world. For the past ten years, Mr. Hechler has been the contract interpreter and escort for the German staff delegation which arrives each summer for a three week program in the United States. Born and raised in Germany, Mr. Hechler graduated from American University in Washington, DC, served in Korea with the U.S. Armed Forces and for more than 37 years was an active Civil Service employee who, prior to retirement was the Director of Policy, Plans and Evaluation at the General Service Administration. Now retired, Mr. Hechler has been devoted to the U.S. Congress--Bundestag Staff Exchange Program. 
Jack Hechler has been invaluable to the U.S. Congress-Bundestag Staff Exchange program by providing continuity to a program which relies heavily on alumni volunteers. The ten member German delegations and the network of American alumni have counted on his insight and discussions to add to this annual program. A recipient of the Order of Merit from the Federal Republic of Germany for his work with this exchange program, he has provided a tremendous service and I offer my most sincere thanks to Jack for his efforts on behalf of the U.S. Congress-Bundestag Staff Exchange program. For a decade of service, vielen dank.

 Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to acknowledge an important milestone by an important institution in my home state of Connecticut--Pitney Bowes. For the past 78 years, Pitney Bowes has been at the forefront of technological innovation. The postage metering mechanisms that the company patented more than seven decades ago have faithfully performed their everyday task of metering postage. 
Twenty years ago Pitney Bowes introduced a postage by phone system, which allowed businesses to refill their postage meters over the phone. This technology has just passed a major milestone. Recently, Pitney Bowes announced the signing of its one-millionth active postage by phone customer. Connecticut's Governor, John Rowland, was on hand to commemorate this event and presented the company with a proclamation noting that nearly three quarters of a billion dollars in time and labor have been saved since the postage by phone system was implemented. 
Together with numerous mass mailing machines developed over the years, Pitney Bowes has changed the face of commerce. They enabled mass mail marketing and created millions of jobs. Indeed, every member of this body has had a campaign that depended on the mass mail systems developed by Pitney Bowes. 
However, Pitney Bowes is not just postage meters. It's not just faxes, copiers, software, business services, financial services, or cryptographic security for cyberspace transactions and communications. It is not just PC postage metering which makes it possible for businesses to print postage using only a PC and a standard printer. It is not just the $100 million in R&D it spends each year or the dozens of new patents that Pitney Bowes receives annually. It is not just cutting-edge technology. 
The spirit of Pitney Bowes is found in its people. More than one million customers, mostly small businesses, use Pitney Bowes products to efficiently conduct their business. Tens of millions of our citizens benefit from the company's mailing and messaging systems. More than thirty thousand employees--seven thousand of these in Connecticut--are dedicated to making all of our jobs easier. It is this spirit that has resulted in Pitney Bowes being repeatedly listed as one of the 100 best companies to work for in America, recognized as providing meaningful opportunities for women and minorities, and respected as a leader in the Connecticut business community. 
Congratulations to the Pitney Bowes workforce on this new milestone.

 Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I am delighted to join today with my colleagues Senator Chafee, the chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee, and Senator Mack in introducing this legislation. It will provide credit, under any future greenhouse gas reduction systems we may adopt, to companies who act now to reduce their emissions of greenhouse gases. This is a voluntary, market-based approach which is a win-win situation for both American businesses and the environment. Enactment of this legislation will provide the certainty necessary to encourage companies to move forward with emission reductions now. I'm particularly pleased that the legislation grows out of principles developed in a dialog between the Environmental Defense Fund and a number of major industries. 
The point of this legislation is simple. Many companies want to move forward now to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions. They don't want to wait until legislation requires them to make these reductions. For some companies reducing greenhouse gases makes good economic sense because adopting cost-effective solutions can actually save them money by improving the efficiency of their operations. Companies recognize if they reduce their greenhouse gas emissions now they will be able to add years to any potential compliance schedule, allowing companies to spread their costs over broader time periods. Acting now can help U.S. companies protect themselves against the potential for significant reductions that may be required in the future. This bill ensures they will be credited in future reduction proposals for action now. 
Early action by U.S. companies will also have an enormous benefit for the environment. Early reductions can begin to slow the rate of buildup of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, helping to minimize the environmental risks of continued global warming. Given that once emitted, many climate change gases continue to trap head for a century or more in the atmosphere, it just makes sense to encourage practical action now. 
Climate change is neither an abstraction nor the object of a science fiction writer's imagination. It is real and affects us all. More than 2,500 of the world's best scientific and technical experts have linked the increase of greenhouse gases to at least some of the increase in sea level, temperature and rainfall experienced worldwide in this century. Last year was the warmest year on record, and 9 of the last 11 years were among the warmest ever recorded. 
The point of this legislation is to provide an incentive for companies that want to make voluntary early reduction in emissions of greenhouse gases by guaranteeing that these companies will receive credit, once binding requirements begin, for voluntary reductions they have made before 2008. These credits will enable US companies to add years to any potential compliance schedule for reductions, allowing them to spread costs over broader time periods. These credits may also be financially valuable to companies who make the reductions. Credits earned likely could be traded or sold to help other companies manage their own reduction requirements. A focus on early reductions can also help stimulate the search for and use of new, innovative strategies and technologies that are needed to help companies both in this country and worldwide meet their reduction requirements in a cost-effective manner. Development of such strategies and technologies can improve American competitiveness in the more than $300 billion global environmental marketplace. 
I'm pleased that this legislation builds on section 1605(b) of the Energy Policy Act which allowed companies to voluntarily record their emissions in greenhouse gas emissions, which I worked hard to include in the Energy Policy Act. 
Mr. President, the debate about climate change is too often vested--and I believe wrongly so--in false choices between scientific findings, common sense, business investments and environmental awareness. The approach of this bill again demonstrates that these are not mutually exclusive choices, but highly compatible goals.   
By Mr. McCain.

 Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, last night the Senate unanimously approved H.R. 2616, the Charter School Expansion Act, a piece of legislation that Senator Coats and I, along with many others, have been working on for the better part of the past two years. the House is expected to pass this bill today under suspension and send on to the President, who has pledged to sign it into law. 
I rise today to express my deep appreciation to our colleagues for their strong bipartisan support of this bill, and to add a few brief words about the significance of its passage, which I am afraid may get lost amidst the last-minute flurry of activity this week before Congress adjourns. 
It would not be too difficult to overlook this legislation. Compared to some of the high-profile education bills we have considered recently, this is a modest and largely anonymous proposal, which will strengthen our support for charter schools and encourage states to create more of these innovative, independent programs. It will not fix all or even much of what ails our public education system. It will not singlehandedly sate the demands of parents for safer schools, better teachers, smaller classes, and smarter students. Nor will it settle the longstanding and often inflammatory debate over education reform that has divided the parties and effectively stymied the efforts of this Congress to respond to the public's growing concerns. 
But nevertheless, I believe that this may turn out to be one of the most important and constructive bills that we enact into law during this season. What we have agreed to do today will help take the charter school model from novelty to the norm in this country, and thereby bolster the most promising engine of education reform at work in America today. The Charter School Expansion Act will spur the growth of hundreds of high-quality and highly-accountable schools of choice, which in the next few years will expand the educational opportunities available to thousands of American children, and could over the long haul help to reshape the public school for the 21st Century. 
Perhaps just as noteworthy as what this legislation will do, though, is the simple fact that we agreed to do it. As my colleagues are well aware, we have struggled throughout this Congress to reach a consensus on how to improve our schools, fighting a series of pitched partisan battles that have bogged down several thoughtful proposals from both sides, and leaving the public to question our ability to address these critical issues. By adopting this bill with unanimous support, I think we have made an important statement that we can get things done, that we can find common ground to strengthen the common school. And I am hopeful, despite the deep policy differences still dividing many of us, that this bill will lay the groundwork for more bipartisan cooperation next year as we prepare to reauthorize the massive Elementary and Secondary Education Act and proceed with what may be the most consequential education debate of our lifetime. 
In marking this accomplishment, I want to thank Senator Coats, who I have had the great pleasure of working on many education reform initiatives over the last few years, and our fellow cosponsors, Senators Kerrey of Nebraska, D'Amato, and Landrieu, who made this a bipartisan effort from the start. I will sorely miss Senator Coats' partnership next year as this great education debate continues, but I am glad that, after many years of frustratingly close votes we have endured together, he can leave on a resounding note of success. 
I particularly want to thank the chairman and ranking member of the Labor Committee, Senators Jeffords and Kennedy, for their leadership in shepherding this bill to the floor. I know there were some difficult issues that had to be resolved to bring our proposal out of committee, and I am grateful to my colleagues from Vermont and Massachusetts for the time and energy they devoted to getting that done. We simply could not have beat the legislative clock were it not for their persistence and skilled bridge-building. 
I also want to pay tribute to our former colleague, Senator Durenberger, whose vision and creativity made this legislation possible in the first place. In 1992 and 1993, a band of pioneering teachers and parents in Minnesota founded the nation's first charter schools, and their efforts inspired Senator Durenberger to propose a national pilot program to help other communities around the country experiment with this progressive reform model. I was proud to join with Senator Durenberger four years ago in cosponsoring the bill authorizing this pilot program, now known as the Federal Charter School Grant Program. Congress approved this initiative with strong bipartisan majorities, and in the years since it has provided $75 million to help new charters to defray the burdensome cost of starting a school from scratch. 
Today, thanks in part to this Federal seed money, the charter school movement has quickly spread throughout the nation. As of this fall, more than 1,100 charters are operating in 26 states, including my home state of Connecticut, as well as the District of Columbia, quadrupling the number that were in business just four years ago. In the past nine months alone, four additional states passed new charter laws, and more than a half dozen others strengthened their laws and significantly expanded their programs. In California, for example, the state legislature broadly supported a move to raise the state cap on charters from 100 to 250 of this year and allow the creation of 100 additional schools each succeeding year. And just last month in Texas, the state board of education approved the creation of 85 new schools, more than doubling the existing number. 
This is truly a grass-roots revolution, led by parents and teachers and community activists, which is seeking to reinvent the public school and take it back to the future, reconnecting public education to some of our oldest, most basic values--ingenuity, responsibility, accountability--and refocusing its mission on doing what's best for the child instead of what's best for the system. 
The results so far have been quite encouring. Parents of charter school students overwhelmingly give their programs high marks, particularly for their responsiveness and the sense of community they foster. Also, broad-based studies done by the Hudson Institute and the Education Department show that charters are effectively serving diverse populations, especially many of the disadvantaged and at-risk children that traditional public schools have struggled to educate. And while it's too soon to determine what impact charter schools are having on overall academic performance, the early returns suggest that charters are succeeding where it matters most, in the classroom. 
A survey done last fall by the National School Boards Association found that the charter movement is already having a positive ripple effect that is being felt in many local public school districts. The NSBA report cites evidence that traditional public schools are working harder to please local families so they won't abandon them to competing charter schools, and that central administrators often see charters as a `a powerful tool' to develop new ideas and programs without fearing regulatory roadblocks. 
The most remarkable aspect of the charter movement may be that it has managed to bring together citizens, educators, business leaders and politicians from across the political spectrum in support of a mutual goal to better educate our children through more choice, more flexibility and more accountablity in our public schools. In these grass-roots, as I suggested above, may lie the roots of a consensus for renewing the promise of public education and ending the left-right stalemate that has too often impeded the reform debate. 
We want to build on that broad agreement at the local and state level and do what we can at the Federal level to support and encourage the growth of this movement, which is just what the legislation we approved today will do. It starts by revamping the charter grant program to focus it more on helping states and local groups create new schools and meet the President's goal of creating 3,000 charters by the year 2000. 
Specifically, it calls for gradually increasing the grant funding over the next several years, and then better targeting those additional dollars to the states that are serious about expanding their charter program. It would do so by establishng several `priority' criteria that would give preference in awarding start-up grants to those states that show real progress in creating high-quality, highly-accountable charters. Our hope is that these changes will give states that have been slow to embrace the charter movement an incentive to get on board. The intent is not to punish those states that are moving cautiously, but instead to reward the ones that are prepared to harness this progressive force for change and encourage others to do the same. 
The CSEA would also tighten some unintended loopholes in the original statute that have hampered the effectiveness of the program, ensure that charter schools receive their fair share of funding from the major Federal categorical grant programs, and take some initial steps to widen the pool of funding sources for those charters that are struggling to stay alive. And to enhance the potential for all children to benefit from charter successes, this legislation directs the Secretary of Education to work with the states to in effect establish an `innovation pipeline' that would share information about what is working in charter schools to public school districts around the country. 
That, in the end, is really what this bill and the charter school movement in general are all about, which is improving the whole of our public education system. As Norman Atkin, a founder and director of the North Star Academy Charter School in Newark, has said, charter schools have the potential to serve as the `R&D arm' of public education, incubating new ideas that could benefit millions of students. And in time hopefully every public school will put into practice the principles undergirding the charter model, and every public school will be liberated from some of the top-heavy bureaucracy that too often suffocates them and in turn pledge to meet high standards of achievement for which they will be held strictly accountable, and every public school will benefit from the positive forces of choice and competition. 
For now, we have taken an important step toward that goal today, and passed a piece of legislation that I am confident will make a real and immediate difference in the lives of many children in this country. I again want to thank my colleagues for their broad vote of confidence in the charter movement, and I look forward to working with them next year on new blueprint for education reform that will incorporate the substance and spirit of what we have achieved today.

Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, we are heading rapidly to the end of this second half of the 105th Congress. There will be time for reviews and evaluations. Some will say what did we accomplish in this second part of this 105th Congress? I hope when we are asked that, one of the answers we will be able to give is that we adopted the International Religious Freedom Act, a historic piece of legislation, genuinely bipartisan, representing and expressing the core beliefs and values of the American people and putting those beliefs and values at the center of our foreign policy. 
It is, in fact, a measure that has the potential to affect the freedom, the lives, the fates of tens of millions of people around the world today who are denied the basic right of freedom of religion that brought so many of our ancestors to the United States. 
This kind of measure does not reach the edge of passage without a lot of strong support. I thank particularly the Senator from Oklahoma, Mr. Nickles, and his outstanding staff--especially Steve Moffitt of that staff--for the hundreds of hours that they spent working on this legislation and the spirit of common purpose that guided them as we went on. 
I thank also my friend and colleague from Delaware, Senator Biden, and his staff, particularly Brian McKeon, who contributed immeasurably to, not only the purpose, but to the way in which this legislation is crafted; to Senator Feinstein and her staff, particularly Dan Shapiro, for their very constructive contributions; and Senator Coats as well, about whom I have a little more to say in a few moments. And I want to recognize Cecile Shea who is on my staff for the literally hundreds of hours she worked to help craft this bill. 
This effort began with some Pied Pipers outside the Congress who educated us to the fact that these religious freedoms that we hold so dear in the United States are not real for many people, millions of people around the world. Surprisingly to many of us, they are particularly not real for people of the Christian faith around the world, who are subjected to discrimination, and in many cases persecution. 
One of the people who started this effort was Michael Horowitz of the Hudson Institute, and he deserves to be mentioned here and thanked for educating and opening our eyes to the persecution that exists. Senator Specter and Congressman Wolf introduced the initial bill. They were the pioneers here and blended together with the effort that Senator Nickles and I initiated here in the Senate. I thank them for their support. 
As we come to the conclusion, I want to thank the administration representatives, led by Under Secretary Stuart Eizenstat, who worked with us to craft the language that could finally be approved by National Security Advisor Sandy Berger and the President. The administration endorsement guarantees that when passed this legislation will become law. 
The list of groups that endorsed the act is extraordinary, a true expression of all of God's children: 
The Episcopal Church, the Catholic Conference, the United Methodist Church Women's Division, the Evangelical Lutherans, the American Jewish Committee, the Christian Coalition, the National Association of Evangelicals--the list goes on and on and on--the B'nai B'rith, the Anti-Defamation League, the Catholic conference of Major Superiors of Men's Institutes, the Jewish Council for Public Affairs, the National Conference of Soviet Jewry, the Union of American Hebrew Congregations, the Union of Orthodox Jewish Congregations of America, the American Coptic Association, Advocates International, the Religious Liberty Commission of the Southern Baptist Convention, Union of American Hebrew Congregations, the International Fellowship of Jews and Christians, the Traditional Values Coalition, the Justice Fellowship and the Church of the Disciples. 
What brought all of these groups together? What brought them together is, in many ways, what brought the founders of our country to these shores and what led them to declare their independence ultimately from England. And that was faith, shared faith in God and a belief that no government has the right to tell people how to worship and certainly does not have the right to discriminate against them or persecute them for the way in which they choose to express their faith in God. 
The founders of this country declared in the Declaration of Independence that: `We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal' and that they have certain endowments, not from the founders of the country, not from a group of politicians. The endowments come from their Creator, and the endowment is the right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. Then in the very first amendment to the Bill of Rights, they established the freedom of religion that has been so dear to our country, so central to our country and such a magnet for our fathers and grandfathers and great grandfathers who came here driven by a desire to have that freedom. 
On this day, I think of my grandmother who came here from Central Europe. My grandmother was probably one of the greatest American patriots I ever knew, for a simple reason: She said to me in her old age how much she loved the country. She said, `It may not seem that profound to you, it may not seem that complicated, but the fact I can walk to synagogue on Saturday morning and not only is no one harassing me or bothering me, not only do I live free of fear, not only do I have no hesitation about what I will find in the synagogue, nobody bothering the building or any of us worshipping there, but my neighbors who are not Jewish, as they see me, say `Good morning, Mrs. Manger, good Sabbath to you.' 
This to her expressed the essence of what it meant to be American and free and the gratitude that she felt. In some measure, I suppose many of us are supporting this legislation and trying to express that gratitude by extending as best we can that freedom and respect to people around the world. 
Some say, `OK, it is good for the United States. What gives you the right to tell other countries how they should treat their citizens?' What we are saying here is that we have the right to express our values; we have the right to put our values at the center of our foreign policy. Countries can do what they will, but we have no obligation to deal with countries on a normal basis, to give them aid and comfort if they are violating a central animating principle of American life, which is freedom of religion. 
Who else, if not a nation whose forebears and citizens, beginning with the Puritans and continuing to this day, suffered under persecutors in foreign lands before coming to this country? Who else will speak for those around the world who are denied those basic liberties? 
Mr. President, this legislation, finely crafted, worked on for more than a year, expresses, in sensible terms, those values to which I have spoken. It clearly states America's unwavering commitment to religious freedom around the world. It requires that every succeeding American administration report once a year on the state of religious freedom in every country in the world--put it on the record--and also report on the steps the administration has taken to encourage--and that is the way this proposal will best work--and raise the status of religious freedom in every country around the world to a level of visibility and report on it. We have given the administrations--this and all future administrations--a menu of choices to respond to, some modest and, in most extreme cases of persecution, some severe. 
In nations where violations are particularly egregious, where torture, execution and inhumane punishment routinely are used to limit the free expression of religion, today the President may choose from a list of economic incentives to pressure the offending government to reform. The menu of sanctions in this bill is narrowly focused. It is designed to mitigate the offending behavior without causing economic hardship to our own country. The President has a waiver authority on the sanctions and is also required to seek, first, multilateral cooperation in this sanctions bill. 
But this is much more than a sanctions bill. It is a reminder to the executive branch of the American Government, both now and in the future, that as it encourages human rights around the world, it must consider freedom of religion. 
This bill requires training in religious freedom issues for foreign service and immigration officials. It establishes an independent commission to monitor religious persecution around the world and to make recommendations to the administration on how to encourage greater religious freedom. 
Mr. President, right now somewhere in the world a man or woman languishes in prison, some on death row, because he or she did nothing more than choose faith in God over personal expediency. They probably wonder if anyone cares about what has happened to them. In too many places in this world today, a group, a village, perhaps a province, will suffer economic hardship, lack of access to medical care, systematic harassment and intimidation because its citizens refuse to turn their backs on the most fundamental definition of who they are. They wonder, I suppose, whether anyone cares or has noticed. And this bill, the International Religious Freedom Act, says to them that we notice, we care and the Government of the strongest nation in the world will speak up for them to protect their right to worship their God in the way in which they choose. 
Mr. President, just a final word about our retiring colleague from Indiana, Senator Dan Coats. As fine a person of faith as I have ever known in my life, as trustworthy a man as I have ever had the privilege to work with, worked very hard on this piece of legislation because the principles embodied in this legislation spring from the inner core of this man of surpassing and illuminating Christian faith. 
In some measure, I think this is one of the great testaments, one of the great monuments that he will leave as he leaves the Senate. With this act, we send a message that our Nation, founded under God, with freedom of conscience on religion as its cornerstone is prepared to do what it can to extend those values reasonably, sensibly to people throughout the world.

Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce today the Clean Electric Power Act of 1998, and to be joined by my colleagues Senators Dodd, Kerry, Lautenberg, and Torricelli. 
This legislation would address a gap in the Clean Air Act that exempts older power plants from strict environmental standards, allowing them to emit more pollutants than newer facilities and contributing to serious environmental problems. This disparity is of particular concern right now as we enter the new world of restructuring of the electric utility industry--a world that was never envisioned at the time of any of the Clean Air Act Amendments, including the 1990 Amendments. Because most of the older plants don't have to expend the same amount of money on environmental controls that newer plants do, it is simple economics that these older plants will benefit under deregulation by increasing their generation of power and, therefore, their emissions of dangerous pollutants into the air. This situation is unfair to utilities that generate electricity while meeting stricter environmental standards, and it is unfair to the public whose health will be endangered. 
Electricity deregulation carries the promise of enormous benefits for the consumer in terms of reduced electric bills which I strongly support. But unless we do it right, electricity deregulation also can result in significant adverse environmental and public health effects. Some of the early results from the initial efforts at deregulation of wholesale power sales, as well as studies containing projections about what might occur, are very disturbing: 
In February, EPA projected increases of 553,000 tons of nitrogen oxides and 62 million tons of carbon by the year 2010 resulting from restructuring, without provisions in restructuring legislation to address pollution increases. 
THe Northeast States for Coordinated Air Use Management in January 1998 found that several large Midwestern power companies substantially increased their wholesale electricity sales between 1995 and 1996. This meant substantially increased generation at several of the companies' highest polluting coal-fired power plants, large increases in the flow of power from the Midwest towards the east, and substantial increases in emissions from power plants. 
A 1995 Harvard University Study concluded that electricity restructuring could adversely affect environmental quality for a number of reasons, including increasing utilization of older, higher emitting coal facilities. 
A 1996 Resources for the Future Study examined the regional air pollution effects that could result from a more competitive market. The study concluded that in the year 2000, the Nation's NOX emissions would increase by about 350,000 tons and the carbon dioxide emissions would increase by about 114 million tons. 
Let me give a little background about how we got to where we are. 
A series of requirements in the 1970 and 1977 Clean Air Act and amendments thereto required that utility plants meet new source performance standards for pollutants, including nitrogen oxides and sulfur dioxide. The act defines these standards as emissions limits reflecting the degree of emission limitation achievable through the application of the best system of emission reduction, taking into account cost, as determined by the Administrator. However, these standards were only imposed on new generating plants, and did not cover existing plants, plants under construction, or in the permitting process or being planned for, unless they undertook major construction. 
At the time, the view was that it would be more cost-effective to impose stricter standards on new facilities than existing ones, and that many of the existing facilities would be retiring soon. But for a number of economic reasons, the anticipated retirement of plants did not occur. More than half of the power plants operating today were built before the new source standards went into effect. 
My legislation would require that power plants that generate electricity that flows through transmission or connected facilities that cross State lines comply with the stricter environmental standards. It would also require EPA to set up a market-based allowance trading program to 
allow utilities to comply in the most cost-effective manner. 
Electric power generating plants are among the largest sources of air pollution in the United States. According to EPA reports, power plants account for 67 percent of all sulfur dioxide emissions, 28 percent of all nitrogen oxide emissions, 36 percent of all carbon dioxide emissions and over 33 percent of mercury emissions. These pollutants contribute significantly to some of the most urgent public health and environmental problems in the United States, including smog, fine particles acid rain, excessive nutrient loads to important water bodies such as Long Island Sound, toxic impacts on health and ecosystems from mercury emissions, climate change, and nitrogen saturation of sensitive forest ecosystems. 
This is not to say that older plants do not have any pollution controls. Some controls are required on these plants under older standards, State Implementation Plans, and the requirements under the acid rain provisions of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990. But in many cases, the controls fall far short of levels that would be achieved under the new source performance standards. Some studies show that the older plants emit pollutants at rates that are often four to ten times higher than the cleanest operating plants, but there is significantly less disparity in areas where states have imposed tighter controls under the State Implementation Plans, state laws or regional programs such as California and parts of the Northeast. In addition, EPA's new regulation requiring 22 states to reduce NOx emissions will result in significant reductions at many power plants. The bill makes clear that nothing affects the obligations of sources to comply with that new regulation in the timeframe set forth by EPA or to comply with any other provision of the Clean Air Act. 
But we still have a situation where there is currently an unacceptably high level of power plant emissions and, in many cases, a disparity in emission requirements between different generators. On top of this, we have a new era of electricity deregulation and restructuring which we are entering at a rapid pace; in the foreseeable future, retail consumers all over the country may be able to choose their supplier of electricity. As I've noted, this era of deregulation was never envisioned at the time of either the 1977 Clean Air Act Amendments or the more recent 1990 Amendments. Increasing competitive markets provide opportunities for relatively low cost generators to increase generation; where cost differentials are due in part to differences in emission standards this will mean increases in generation at the highest emitting plants. 
Mr. President, the good news is that cost-effective technologies are available to meet these stricter standards. For example, the Northeast States for Coordinated Air Use Management and the Mid-Atlantic Regional Air Management Association have recently completed a report on the availability of controls for NOx and the cost-effectiveness of those controls. The report shows that a number of advanced emissions control technologies are available that can reduce NOx emissions from utilities by 85 percent or more, and that these controls are not only feasible but are highly cost-effective. The report looked at real world experience with the application of available technology at 19 coal fired facilities and found that NOx emissions nearly 50 percent stricter than EPA's new standard for NOx can be achieved at the vast majority of coal utilities. Of course, under the bill grandfathered utilities would have the option of purchasing allowances as an alternative method of meeting the performance standards. 
Mr. President, as we enter the era of deregulation we have a unique opportunity to provide great benefits for the consumers and reduce air pollution, which I strongly support. But we need to ensure that proper pollution safeguards are in place to rectify the current disparity in standards and to ensure that air pollution does not increase in a competitive market.

Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I want to say how pleased I am that this chamber has finally come to agreement on S. 442, the Internet Tax Freedom Act. First, I would like to thank Senator Wyden for introducing this bill and his perseverance to see this legislation through. I would like to thank Chairman McCain for his management of this bill, and Senator Dorgan for working so closely with Senator Wyden to arrive at a compromise. I would like to thank Senator Gregg for his unwavering insistence on what he believes is right. I would like to acknowledge the efforts of Senator Bumpers and Senator Graham who come to this issue from a different viewpoint but have tried to seek a common ground in what has been a polarizing and difficult negotiation. 
I truly believe the most important things accomplished by this bill will be, first, to raise the visibility of the issue of taxation of the Internet. Just having this debate in Congress has stimulated discussion and thought about the future of electronic commerce and the Internet throughout the country. Three states--Texas, South Carolina, and my home State of Connecticut--came forward and said that they did not want their States' taxes to be grandfathered into the tax moratorium, but instead preferred to stop taxing the Internet. This debate has raised the consciousness of public leaders as to the great benefits electronic commerce holds for U.S. business to improve its productivity and reach new customers, and even more importantly, the level playing field the Internet provides for small businesses. At the same time, we have become aware of the enormous problems faced by small businesses which are suddenly, over the net, selling beyond their physical reach and the uncertainties they face in the legal and tax environment in 30,000 taxing jurisdictions. 
The second major benefit of this bill will be to slow down the taxation of the Internet. The moratorium in S. 442, while grandfathering in existing State taxes on Internet access, will prevent new taxes from being added. 
The third, and I consider the most important, major benefit of this legislation will be the creation of a commission to draft model State legislation creating uniform categories for these new Internet companies and transactions that gives these firms some certainty as to how they will be treated tax-wise in the different States. This is the essence of the bill that Senator Gregg and myself introduced in March, called NETFAIR, S. 1888--to remove the uncertainty under which electronic commerce companies have had to operate in the United States and bring some order into the present business climate. It is our intent that this model State legislation would not preempt the States, but would be adopted by the States, at their choice. 
The Senate agreed to expand the duties of the commission beyond that of drafting model State legislation to looking at the States' collection of use taxes on all remote sales. This is a legitimate area of study and of concern to the States and to their revenue base. In opposing this amendment, I was merely voicing my concern that the commission may become bogged down in a debate over the taxation of catalog sales that I fear it will not be able to stay focused on the Internet and accomplish the very useful purpose of helping create a predictable legal environment for electronic commerce. It is my hope that the commission will try to complete the draft State legislation outlined in S. 442 first before turning to this larger debate. 
At this point, I want to thank Senators Roth and Moynihan and the rest of the Finance Committee members for adding the international element to this bill. The Finance Committee reminded us to consider our domestic policies toward the Internet in the context of the international environment. Just as the Internet puts small companies on an equal footing with large companies, it also is creating a new level playing field internationally. Developing countries that have not yet fully industrialized, and countries whose telephone penetration is only a fraction of that in the United States, can leap frog entire stages of technology and move straight into fiber optic and wireless technologies that will carry video, sound, data, and voice. 
A number of my colleagues and I have had an opportunity to speak with John Chambers, the President and CEO of Cisco Systems, one of the major suppliers of networking equipment at a breakfast last week. He knows something about electronic commerce since his company accounted for one-third of all electronic commerce last year. I was very impressed when he said that, on his trip through Asia, the political leaders of Singapore, Malaysia, Hong Kong and China wanted to hold substantive one- to two-hour conversations with him because they understand the power on the Internet and understand that information technology will change, not just their country's economy, but the economy of the world. They understand that those countries that embrace the information age will prosper and those who don't will fall behind. 
Once again, Mr. President, I want to thank my colleagues and their staffs for the extraordinary effort they made to reach this point where we can finally vote on this bill. Finally, I would like to thank Laureen Daly of my staff who put in an enormous amount of work to assure that Connecticut's constituents, businesses and government will benefit from this legislation.

Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Chair. 
Mr. President, I rise to oppose the amendment offered by the Senator from Arkansas and others and to express my support of the underlying amendment offered in the first instance by the Senator from Arizona, the chairman of the committee. I am proud to be a cosponsor of that one. 
I was a cosponsor of the initial legislation, one of the pieces of legislation earlier in the session, along with my colleague from New Hampshire, Senator Gregg, which had the intention of trying to create some order and predictability and a little space for this extraordinary new area of economic activity, activity which has benefited so many people around our country, which is to say, e-commerce over the Internet. 
The aim was to say to the taxing jurisdictions, of which there are thousands and thousands and thousands--30,000, as a matter of fact--potential taxing jurisdictions which exist in the United States, catch your breath, sit back, and let this new sector of our economy--Internet commerce, e-commerce, which the United States is heading and which has benefited so many people, which has created so many jobs--let it grow out of its infancy before we begin to put the teeth of the taxman into various parts of its anatomy; and let's let this commission begin to grow some ground rules for the consistent and fair handling of this new area of economic activity. 
The fact is today that an Internet service provider, or a merchant selling goods or services over the Internet, has no way of knowing in advance whether a State decides to tax them. As an example, in New Mexico, Internet access charges are subject to New Mexico gross receipts taxes. In Ohio, their sales are taxed as an electronic information service; in Tennessee, it is a telecommunications service; in my own State of Connecticut, as a computer and data processing services. Texas officials, I gather, have threatened to tax transactions that go through Internet servers in its State, even if the buyer and seller, in conventional terms, are not located in the State of Texas. 
The uncertainty of this tax liability is real and is having what you would expect--a negative, destabilizing effect on this business. Peat Marwick, a respected, recognized firm, just released a survey of industry executives of companies that sell over the Internet. Fifty percent of the executives said that the current State tax ambiguities and conflicting tax treatment of electronic commerce among the States are inhibiting their companies' involvement in electronic commerce. Ninety percent describe the current State sales tax procedures with regard to electronic commerce as `overly burdensome,' and 75 percent expressed their concern that State and local tax laws will place their companies at a disadvantage. It is because the industry is in its infancy. 
A predictable legal environment is exactly what the President's Report on Electronic Commerce recommended that we promote internationally. In fact, the administration has been sending out emissaries over the last year to persuade international organizations and individual countries to agree to create a predictable legal environment for the spread of electronic commerce. That is not only fair, it is good for American business, which happens to have a lead over business in any other countries in the effective use of the Internet. 
What the underlying bill, the underlying amendment, is saying is that it is time that we create the same sense of predictability here in the United States that our Government is urging on countries around the world. That is what this commission would do. 
The commission is asked to draft model State legislation that creates uniform definitions and categories of commercial transactions on the Internet so that States will be using the same vocabulary when it comes to categorizing the tax liabilities of an Internet company, or transaction--not unifying a tax rate among States, but creating a legal environment in which companies can do business. 
The National Commission on Uniform State Legislation has been working for the past 2 years on updating the treatment of Internet transactions according to various State laws. But it has not looked directly at taxes. This commission that would be created by this legislation would work with the national commission and other groups that have already been active in trying to update laws to be certain that Internet commerce is treated fairly. We would extend their work through this commission in the tax arena. 
I want to stress that the measure introduced by the distinguished chairman of committee, the Senator from Arizona--Senator Gregg, I, and others are proud to be cosponsors--does not preclude the commission created by this legislation from considering the question of nexus or taxation of remote sales. The danger in this amendment before us, the second-degree amendment, is that it singles these particular questions out as a requirement and thereby, I think, puts the commission in danger of falling into a very dense thicket. 
A battle has been waging for more than three decades, and taken right to the Supreme Court at one point, as to how remote sales by catalog-telephone sales would be taxed by the 30,000 taxing jurisdictions in the States in the country. In so doing, I think the amendment threatens what is and should be the focus of the commission, which is to direct its attention on this extraordinary new sector of commerce, Internet commerce, and it runs the risk really of getting the commission so tied up in the thicket of remote sales that it will never really contribute what we hope it will to creating some order and predictability in e-commerce. 
Mr. President, the fact is that this commission that is created by the underlying legislation may well--I think we who are its sponsors hope it will--create some language to reach some judgments that may in fact offer some counsel and help in this ongoing debate about taxation of remote sales, but let that happen naturally--that is my hope and prayer--as opposed to forcing it into the second-degree amendment in a way that would run the risk of destroying the underlying purpose of the proposal, and in that sense doing damage to Internet commerce and all who both benefit from it as consumers and benefit from it because they work in companies that are using it. 
I want to mention one other matter before closing. That is this: There are times when we talk about Main Street and the effect of Internet commerce on Main Street as if it were, one wins and one loses. 
The reality is that e-commerce has the potential to expand the winner's circle, to make more winners. I want to cite real cases from Connecticut which I learned about in the last 6 months to a year, and I think are typical of what is happening all over the country. 
First, let me say that a recent survey in Connecticut found that 38 percent of small- and medium-sized companies have a web page--almost two out of five. A little over half of those are using their web page to sell goods and services--right now. And 21 percent are planning to add a web page next year. I am sure those numbers are going to grow dramatically in coming years. 
The fact is, insofar as some folks who are in taxing jurisdictions and the concern of this amendment has to do with treatment of direct mail-order sales or phone sales, if the mail-order catalogs that I get at my house are any indication of what the future is, I am being truly encouraged, aggressively encouraged by those catalogs instead of calling up, to use the Internet. So I think more and more of that kind of commerce will be done by e-commerce. 
But let me give you two great examples from home about the effect that the Internet is having on Main Street. A small company in old Broad Brook, CT, beautiful town by the water on Long Island Sound, called Stencil Ease, family-owned, 18 employees, sells stencils for home decorating and crafts. It started a web page in 1996. They have been averaging 100 to 200 hits a day. Their sales increased 10 percent the first year due to the web site and 20 percent the next year. 
Here is a startling story in the second one--Coastal Tool & Supply. I have been there. It is a small, family-run hardware store in Hartford, CT, capital city. It was threatened, interestingly, by a location nearby of one of the large chain hardware stores. It was having a hard time. They decided to go on the Internet, in a sense to leap over the big competitor down the street. I think it was Home Depot, but it doesn't matter--a big competitor down the street and in a sense enter the global main street and hired a very able young man, skilled in computer matters, who put their catalog essentially on the Internet. Sales have grown almost 500 percent. They are doing more business over the Internet than they are from people coming into the store. 
So this is what the future holds, and it is a situation, if we do it right, where not only the big companies, but a lot of mom-and-pop stores and businesses are going to be able to benefit from Internet sales. 
Now, as it grows, it will actually have an effect on taxing jurisdictions, and we will naturally, in the normal order of business, want to create an opportunity for equity and to protect State and local jurisdictions that we represent. But this is not the time to do it, and this amendment is not the place to do it. Let's let this commission deal with the unique problems of e-commerce.

Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Senator from Oregon for his comments. I thank him for his leadership. Senator Gregg and I were happy to merge together with the work the Senator from Oregon and the Senator from Arizona have done. 
I want to end with one story the Senator from Oregon has stimulated in my memory when I visited that hardware store. It shows how you not only jump over the big store down the block but into the global shopping mall. 
One of their favorite stories--and this is not a pure market example because the particular customer I am about to refer to is from a Middle Eastern country--is about a man who happened to work for his country's national airlines, so his trip here was paid for, but he needed some large, heavy tools. He went on the Internet, found his way to the Coastal Tool & Supply web site, competitively priced, figured out the advantage, was on a flight to New York as part of his normal work, got off the plane, rented a truck, drove up to Hartford, bought the tools that he needed, drove back, put them on the plane, and went back to the Middle East, all smart shopping and good for business. 
So I hope that our colleagues will resist the allures of this second-degree amendment and will not disrupt the noble and, I think, very necessary intention of the underlying bill. We can come back some other day, hopefully, informed by the work of the commission created herein to deal with the border problems that I know concern the Senator from Arkansas and the other cosponsors of the amendment. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, today I introduce the Federal Benefit Verification and Integrity Act. This legislation takes a government-wide approach to improving eligibility verification and debt collection in Federal benefit and assistance programs by identifying, testing, evaluating, and, in some cases, implementing `data sharing' information technologies. Federal agencies would be encouraged to make use of federal, state, and private databases such as the National Directory of New Hires and credit bureau data to help ensure that the government delivers benefits to the right person, at the right time, for the right amount. This bill mirrors Title VI of H.R. 4243, a bill introduced in the House by Representatives Steve Horn and Carolyn Maloney. 
The President's Council on Integrity and Efficiency has found that the federal government loses billions of dollars each year by not adequately verifying information in applications for federal benefit programs. For example, an audit by the Department of Education's Office of Inspector General disclosed that approximately $109 million in Pell grants had been over-awarded in 1996 because students failed to report or under-reported their income. The Department of Housing and Urban Development projected that during the same year it had paid out at least $600 million in excess rental subsidies because of tenants' under-reporting of income. 
News reports confirm the pervasiveness of this type of fraud against the government. One story in the Wall Street Journal described how `student-aid consultants' charged clients $350 each for phony tax returns, which would under-report the student's family income. Because the government does not compare the tax return accompanying the student loan application with the tax forms that had been submitted to the IRS, the student can fraudulently apply to the government for financial aid and receive thousands of dollars in Pell grants. In another example, the Washington Post reported that an owner of a California trade school was indicted on allegations that he stole $1 million in federal Pell grants by creating imaginary students. Since the government never compared the names of these students with information it already had, the school was able to hide its crimes for years. 
The report of the President's Council on Integrity and Efficiency concluded that federal agencies need eligibility verification to deter and detect the growing fraud in federal benefit and assistance programs. Several federal agencies do have procedures to try to verify information submitted by applicants by comparing it with information contained in various federal and state government databases. Unfortunately the legislative authority for gaining access to this verifying data often does not encompass many of the most useful government sources: there is no comprehensive authority to share data among agencies. Private industry has made great strides in improving eligibility information accuracy, and the federal government could clearly learn from the best business practices of companies like American Express, Visa, Citicorp and Nationsbank. This bill contains provisions to encourage the government to test and incorporate best commercial business practices for eligibility verification. 
Similarly, information contained in the National Directory of New Hires and other databases could be a vital aid to the Department of Education's efforts to locate debtors under its student loan programs, and to other agencies trying to locate and collect from debtors. The Department of Education devotes 70% of its debt collection efforts to locating debtors. The National Directory of New Hires, a comprehensive database that lists where virtually all Americans are employed, was recently established as part of the legislation to find and crack down on `deadbeat dads'. The Directory is maintained by the Department of Health and Human Services, and the data contained in the database cannot be shared with other agencies without explicit legislative authorization. As with child support collection, the Department of Education could use the New Hires directory as an enormously helpful tool to locate where a debtor lives and works. Once a debtor is found, the Department could then use its existing authority to notify the debtor, and then as a last resort and after meeting all due process requirements, the Department could garnish the debtor's wages. 
To improve government-wide data-sharing coordination, this legislation creates a `Federal Benefit Verification and Payment Integrity Board' which would provide oversight and foster agency interest in pursuing data sharing ideas and technologies. Once an agency tests an idea and obtains a positive result, the Board can recommend to the Congress that permanent authorizing legislation be enacted. Federally funded benefit programs that could use data-sharing technologies include: the Pell Grant program, federal student loan programs, Medicaid, the Food Stamp program, USDA and HUD housing programs, veterans compensation programs, Social Security programs, the Railroad Retirement Survivor program, the Civil Service Retirement Program, Small Business Administration programs, and USDA business programs. While this list is not exhaustive, the legislation would promote data-sharing between agencies that have the current statutory authority to do so. 
In addition, this legislation balances the need for data in verifying eligibility with the paperwork burden and privacy intrusion that data sharing imposes. In fact, this legislation contains a number of increased privacy protections, including requiring that agency proposals contain administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to ensure the security and confidentiality of records; prohibiting nonessential duplication and re-disclosure of records within or outside an agency receiving information for a test; expanding encryption and electronic signature technology to protect the confidentiality and integrity of information; and doubling the penalty for willfully violating the privacy act to $10,000. Existing computer matching and privacy act laws will not be changed. 
The act also expands on the present full due process rights of beneficiaries, including all rights under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act. The bill ensures that agencies administering federally funded benefit programs adequately inform applicants applying for benefits that their data can be shared to verify their eligibility for those benefits. The agency will be required to maintain a record of each applicant's acknowledgment. In this way, agencies can encourage individuals to provide accurate information when applying for benefits. Moreover, applicants will be given the opportunity to explain inconsistencies. 
Finally, the Committee recognizes the importance of keeping the National Directory of New Hires data secure and private. Consequently, this legislation intends that any agency requesting access to the National Directory of New Hires have the statutory authorization to access the same kind of data from other data sources. Also, all data matches with the New Hires database must occur under the Department of Health and Human Services, the agency who owns this information. This way, the government would be able to centralize all data matches at one location--where the data resides. 
By using data-sharing technologies, agencies can deter and prevent fraud while becoming more accurate and efficient. This bill promotes data-sharing tools which can save taxpayers substantial resources and at the same time encourage beneficiaries of government programs to deal honestly with their government. Accordingly, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.

Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I want to thank Senator Hatch for introducing this important legislation, which I am pleased to co-sponsor with him and Senators Dodd, Ashcroft, Sessions, and Torricelli. As Senator Hatch already has explained, this bill addresses an issue--asbestos litigation--that has clogged the federal and state courts for some time now. Due to the huge number of these cases and the massive verdicts they often yield, it is unclear whether those who have been exposed to asbestos, but have not yet become sick, will be able to gain full compensation for their injuries should they become sick in the future. 
To address these concerns, and respond to calls from the courts and others for creating an alternative mechanism for resolving these disputes outside of the court system, a settlement was reached several years ago that, among other things, would have created an alternative claims resolution system for dealing with certain asbestos claims. Unfortunately, despite the desire of representatives of the interested parties--both victims and defendants--to enter into this settlement, and despite the trial court's belief that the settlement was fair, the Supreme Court voided it. The Supreme Court acted, however, not because it believed that the settlement was in any respect unfair, but instead because it concluded that only Congress has the authority to sanction such a settlement. 
That is the goal of this goal--for Congress to step up to the plate and authorize a solution to the asbestos litigation problem that will ensure that all those who become sick from asbestos are fairly and efficiently compensated, as contemplated by the parties' earlier settlement. Because I believe this is a problem crying out for Congressional action, and because I believe the settlement reached by the parties was a fair one, I am supporting the bill. 
With that said, I understand that representatives of some of those exposed to asbestos who supported the settlement are not currently supporting this proposed legislation. Because I firmly believe that this should go forward as a consensus bill, I remain open to supporting any reasonable changes that would be required to gain the support of all parties with an interest in asbestos litigation. I am hopeful that we can gain their support and move forward with and pass this legislation.

Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Chair. 
Mr. President, let me say at the outset that the bill before us addresses a very important problem, which is to say the need to protect the Senate's constitutional role in the appointment of Federal officers. The Constitution, as my colleagues have indicated, provides that the President's power to appoint officers of the United States is to be exercised `by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate. . . .' 
Unfortunately, in too many cases over the course of the past several administrations, the Senate's constitutional prerogatives have too often been ignored through the executive's far-too-common practice of appointing acting officials to serve lengthy periods in positions that are supposed to be filled with individuals confirmed by the Senate. I think it is, therefore, entirely appropriate--indeed necessary--for Congress to act to remedy this situation. 
I appreciate very much the leadership given by the Senator from West Virginia, the Senator from South Carolina, and the chairman of our committee, the Senator from Tennessee. I also appreciate those Senators' willingness to work with the members of the Governmental Affairs Committee, including this Senator, to accommodate some of the concerns we have had as the bill moved through committee. 
The fact is, throughout that whole period of time, the effort to reform the Vacancies Act has been a truly bipartisan one, as it should be. Even though I believe there are some problems remaining with the bill, I also am confident that the process of resolving those problems has been conducted in good faith and with fairness on all sides. 
I therefore regret that, along with many of my colleagues, I find myself in the situation I am today, which is to say, prepared to vote against cloture on this bill, because I believe there remain serious substantive problems with the bill, and the procedural situation we are in now with a cloture motion having been filed in an attempt to limit debate will frustrate our ability to work together to solve some of those remaining problems. 
I think it is particularly unfortunate that we find ourselves in this position on this bill because I am confident that, were we not forced immediately into a cloture vote, we likely could work out the problems that remain with the bill. It remains my hope, if cloture is not obtained on the vote that will occur in a little more than 10 minutes, that we can continue to work together to achieve a unanimous consent agreement that will allow perhaps for amendments that are relevant, if not germane, according to the procedures of the Senate. 
Let me briefly give an example of one of the problems that I think remains with the bill which is of concern to some. As the bill is currently drafted, only one of two individuals can serve as acting officials in the case of a vacancy: Either the first assistant to the vacant position, a term of art that generally refers to the top deputy; or someone already confirmed by the Senate for another position. Because individuals holding Senate-confirmed positions already have a lot to do, it almost always will be the first assistant who takes over as the acting. 
But, by the terms of the bill, a first assistant apparently can take over only if he or she was the first assistant at the time of the vacancy. This severe limitation on the universe of individuals who may serve as acting is, in my view, a mistake that could be harmful to the functioning of the executive branch because it will have the effect of forcing many important positions to remain vacant, potentially for several months at a time. That is because there are many times when a vacancy occurs at a time that the first assistant position is also vacant. 
There may be other times when a first assistant, who was there when the vacancy occurred, may want to leave his or her job during the pendency of that vacancy. In both situations, as I read the literal terms of the bill as it is before us, it would require that during the duration of the vacancy, which could be many months long, we would be requiring that no one other than people who had already been confirmed for other positions would be eligible to serve as the acting in the vacant position. We would be effectively denying the executive branch the ability to put someone else in that position on an acting basis. 
Also troubling is what can happen when a new President comes into office. If individuals in Senate-confirmed positions leave before the new President takes office, as often happens, then the only people who would be qualified to serve as acting officials as the new administration gets off the ground, because they were the first assistants at the time of the vacancy, are holdovers, often political appointees from the previous administration. That could create an awkward situation that would require a new administration to staff itself with a previous administration's political appointees. 
I am confident that we could work this problem out were the bill to come to the floor under the normal processes. But, unfortunately, in the posture that it is now in, it is not so. 
So I must say I again will vote against cloture, but I do remain hopeful that if cloture is not granted on this next vote, we will be able to find a way together to continue the bipartisan path that this bill has taken, until this moment when it has reached the Senate floor, and find a way to find a common ground to move forward with this bill on which a lot of work has been done, and, though it is detailed and intricate, in which the public interest finds a great expression. 
I thank the Chair and yield the floor.

 Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Alcohol and Drug Recovery Centers, Inc. of Hartford, Connecticut, on its 25th Anniversary. ADRC provides much-needed services to the residents of 29 Greater Hartford communities: helping men and women first confront then overcome their addictions so they may live productive, substance free lives. 
For a quarter of a century, the dedicated workers of ADRC have lent a helpful hand to their neighbors, regardless of race, sex, sexual orientation, disability, or economic circumstances. Their work has had a tangible impact on the community and I am proud to honor ADRC for its work on behalf of Hartford-area families. 
This dynamic and proactive organization has continually blazed a trail for other community groups to follow. ADRC has worked hard to earn this praise on its silver anniversary and I am happy to wish all of its staff and friends continued success.

Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Chair. I thank my friend from New Jersey particularly for his leadership in bringing this resolution forward and to express my own pleasure at being a cosponsor along with a bipartisan group of cosponsors. 
Mr. President, very briefly, this resolution is about principle. It is not about politics. It is about the principle of self-determination, which was at the heart of the creation of America--the principle of self-determination, democracy, self-rule. It has continued throughout our history to today, when it remains a fundamental priority element of our foreign policy toward other peoples and other nations. 
Really, what this is about is taking that fundamental American principle which we are eager to apply around the world and applying it to 4 million of our fellow American citizens who live on the islands that constitute Puerto Rico, who served and died in defense of America's freedom in disproportionate numbers. They deserve the right to become fully free, determine their destiny, participate fully, if they choose and how they choose, in our democracy. 
Senator Murkowski has been a very steadfast leader in this effort. It didn't get as far as he or we wanted, but this resolution at least gives us the possibility, before the 105th session adjourns and prior to the referendum that will be held in Puerto Rico in December, to say as Members of the Senate of both parties we welcome the exercise and recognize the right of our 4 million fellow Americans in Puerto Rico to express themselves to us and that we will review any such communication that results from the vote that they hold in December. It is the least we can do to be true to our principles. 
I thank the Chair and I yield the floor.

Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, I came to the floor to speak about campaign finance reform, and I will do that in a moment, but I thank my colleague from Missouri for adding me as a cosponsor of the resolution. As is obvious to my colleagues, I am neither from Missouri nor California, so my claim to being added is my status as a baseball fan. And even though my colleagues may think I am reaching, the fact is that when Roger Maris set the record I was in college together with the junior Senator from Missouri. So it gives me some standing. 
I do want to identify myself with his comments just to stress the obvious personal achievement here that has inspired the country, and also the way in which Mark McGwire did it. It was an act of fate, but somehow so correct, that he tied the record at the 61st homer on the day of his father's 61st birthday, because baseball, in my experience in this country, is very much a matter of one generation passing on the experience to another. 
My own memories of baseball, first memories, come from my dad taking me to games, and they are cherished memories. I can tell my colleagues--I hope I am not violating her privacy--when my youngest child was 4 days old, in March, I held her up to a TV set and said, `Sweetheart, this is baseball, and you're going to love it.' Fortunately, for me, she has, and we have shared that experience. As Senator Ashcroft indicated, Mark McGwire beautifully continued that with his son there as a batboy. 
The second is the obvious rapport between Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa, as they compete for this but do it with extraordinary mutual respect. To make the point that is obvious but maybe still worth making, here we have one person whose family has been in this country a long time, from a family of relative success and comfort, another a new American born in poverty in another country, coming here, joined together in this remarkable American game to I think this year break records that were previously thought to be impossible. 
And a final word about Roger Maris, who did set the record in the younger days of both my life and Senator Ashcroft's life. I felt that Mark McGwire probably brought the whole country to give more tribute to Roger Maris than he ever had before, and we owed it to him. So I am proud to be added as a cosponsor. 
Did the Senator from Missouri wish to add anything before I proceed to the topic of campaign finance reform?

Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, if I may continue the stretch to link the two subject matters, baseball and campaign finance reform, may I say that unlike the Brooklyn Dodgers of old, those of us who support McCain-Feingold are not willing to wait until next year, and since McGwire and Sosa are setting the standard for doing what we thought was impossible, we hope they are an eye-opener for those who think adopting campaign finance reform is impossible for this Chamber this year. 
I make the comparison without wanting to set it too closely, but wouldn't it be great when this is over if we could refer to McCain-Feingold as the legislative equivalent of McGwire and Sosa? 
I will cease and desist and proceed with my remarks.

Mr. LIEBERMAN. I rise to speak on behalf of McCain-Feingold, the amendment offered, to thank my two colleagues for the extraordinary, principled, persistent, and practical leadership that they have given this critical effort, and to urge my colleagues to support the cloture motion that comes up tomorrow. 
Madam President, we have a cherished principle in this country that every person gets one and only one vote, that a citizen's influence on our government's decisions rests on the power of his or her ideas, not the size of his or her pocketbook. The campaign finance system we have on the books protects this privilege. May I repeat, the campaign finance system we have on our law books protects this principle. It imposes strict limits on the amounts individuals can contribute to parties and to campaigns. The law prohibits unions and corporations from making most contributions or expenditures in connection with elections to Federal office, and it requires disclosure of money spent in advocating the election or defeat of candidates for Federal office. 
That is what the campaign laws as they are on the books today require. But as we learned sadly during the 1996 campaigns and the various investigations that have followed, those laws appear to be written in invisible ink, which is to say that they have been honored, if one can use the term satirically, only in the breach. They have largely been evaded. 
It has been several months since the Governmental Affairs Committee's investigation into the 1996 campaigns ended, but none of us who were part of that investigation will forget, nor I hope will others forget, what we learned there or our feeling of outrage and embarrassment upon learning it. We learned not only of hustlers like Johnny Chung, who saw the White House like a subway--put some money in and the gates will open, he said--or of opportunists like Roger Tamraz, who used big dollar donations to gain access that was originally denied to him by policymakers at the same time he declined even to register to vote because he saw the vote which generations of Americans have fought and died to protect as a meaningless exercise, a process which would gain him no real power, particularly not when compared to the power that $300,000 would give him. 
We also learned in the Governmental Affairs hearings last year of something that was in its way even more disturbing because it was more pervasive and had a far greater effect on our elections and on our government. We learned that we no longer have a campaign finance system, that the loopholes have become so large and so many that they have taken over the entirety of the law, leaving us with little more than a free-for-all money chase in its place. We learned last year that it was somehow possible, for example, for wealthy donors to give hundreds of thousands of dollars to finance campaigns, even though the law was clearly intended to limit their contributions to a tiny fraction of those sums. That is what the law on the books says. It was possible for corporations and unions to donate millions of dollars to the parties at the candidate's request despite the decades-old prohibition on those entities' involvement in Federal campaigns. That is clearly on the law books. It was possible for the two Presidential nominees to spend much of the fall shaking the donor trees, even though they had pledged under the law, in this case the Presidential campaign finance law, not to raise money for their campaigns after receiving $62 million each in taxpayer funds. 
It was possible for tax-exempt groups to run millions of dollars worth of television ads that clearly endorsed or attacked particular candidates, even though they were just as clearly barred by law from engaging in such partisan activity. 
Madam President, the disappearance, if I may call it that, of our campaign finance laws, which is to say the evasion of the clear intent of those laws, has serious consequences that none of us should overlook. Because our current system effectively has no limits on it, our political class, if you will, lives in a world in which a never-ending pursuit for money is often the only road--the only perceived road to survival. With each election cycle the competition for money gets fiercer and fiercer, the amounts needed to be spent get bigger and bigger, and consequently the amount of time Presidential candidates, national party leaders, fundraisers--all of us need to raise for our parties gets greater and greater. 
In the 1996 election cycle the national parties raised $262 million in so-called soft or unregulated money, 12 times what they raised in 1984. And what about the current cycle, the 1997-1998 cycle? National party committees in the first 18 months of the 1998 election cycle have raised almost $116 million in soft money, more than double the $50 million raised during a comparable period by national party committees in 1994, which was the last non-Presidential election cycle. 
Let none of us deceive ourselves that this unrelenting and ever-escalating money chase has no impact on the integrity of our Government and the impression our constituents have of our Government and those of us who serve in it. That clearly is the sad story, told by the Governmental Affairs investigation last year, and by the host of other investigations, journalistic and otherwise, that have been done of that 1996 election. Our country is focused at this moment in our history on the misconduct which our President acknowledged in his statement on August 17. The consequences of that misconduct were great, but that was the failure of one person. The failure that we speak of today, on the other hand, if we do not act to correct it, belongs to us all. It is systemic, and none of us should doubt that it will get worse unless we do something to change it. 
Senator McCain was right, the Senator from Arizona, when he said a while ago that probably the biggest scandal in Washington today is the current state of our campaign finance laws. How can any of us justify a system in which our elected officials repeatedly appear at events exclusively available only to those who can give $50,000 or $100,000 or more, amounts that are obviously out of reach for the average American and above the annual incomes, in fact, of so many of our citizens--the annual incomes of so many of our citizens. How can any of us justify a system in which we, public servants, must divert so much of our time from the people's business to the business of fundraising? How can we justify a system that has so disenchanted our constituents that, according to an October 1997 Gallup survey, only 37 percent of Americans believe that the best candidate wins elections; 59 percent believe elections are generally for sale; in which 77 percent of Americans believe that their national leaders are most influenced by pressure from their contributors, while only 17 percent believe we are influenced by what is in the best interests of our country? That is a searing indictment of what we are devoting our lives to--public service, the national interest; and it comes, I believe, directly from the way in which we raise money for our campaigns, certainly at the Presidential and national level. 
How can any of us justify not taking action, some action, to reform our campaign finance system this year, in this 105th session, after all of the time and energy and resources Members of both sides of the aisle have spent investigating, in effect denouncing, the conditions that prevail under the current system? The fact is, I respectfully suggest, that we cannot justify such a system and we cannot justify inaction. 
In the additional views that I was privileged to submit to the Government Affairs Committee report on its investigation of the 1996 campaigns, I wrote that I came away from that year-long investigation with an overarching sense that our polity has fallen down a long, dark hole into a place that is far from the vision of values of those who founded our democracy. I find it hard to see how others can come away from that experience, or any other experience which allows them to examine what has become of our campaign finance laws, without reaching a similar conclusion. We no longer live in a system in which every citizen's vote counts equally, or anywhere near equally. Instead, we live in a system in which what seems to matter most is how much money we can raise. 
It is time to act to restore a sense of integrity to our campaign finance system, to restore the public's trust in it and us. This is not a radical idea. All we are really asking is to restore our system to what it was meant to be, to what in fact the letter of Federal law is today: a system where individuals can participate in our political system, but they are limited in their ability to use their incomes to influence their Government; where only individuals, not corporations and unions, may use their money to directly influence our elections, and where we all know, through disclosure, who it is that is contributing and the public may judge to what extent those contributions are influencing our actions and our votes. 
Madam President, I hope that our colleagues will do what most observers seem to think we will not, which is to vote for cloture tomorrow to take up this bill and to clear this cloud from over our political system. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to make the most difficult and distasteful statement, for me probably the most difficult statement I have made on this floor in the 10 years I have been a Member of the U.S. Senate. 
On August 17, President Clinton testified before a grand jury convened by the independent counsel and then talked to the American people about his relationship with Monica Lewinsky, a former White House intern. He told us that the relationship was `not appropriate,' that it was `wrong,' and that it was `a critical lapse of judgment and a personal failure' on his part. In addition, after 7 months of denying that he had engaged in a sexual relationship with Ms. Lewinsky, the President admitted that his `public comments about this matter gave a false impression.' He said, `I misled people.' 
Mr. President, my immediate reaction to this statement that night it was delivered was deep disappointment and personal anger. I was disappointed because the President of the United States had just confessed to engaging in an extramarital affair with a young woman in his employ and to willfully deceiving the Nation about his conduct. I was personally angry because President Clinton had, by his disgraceful behavior, jeopardized his administration's historic record of accomplishment, much of which grew out of the principles and programs that he and I and many others had worked on together in the new Democratic movement. I was also angry because I was one of the many people who had said over the preceding 7 months that if the President clearly and explicitly denies the allegations against him, that of course I believe him. 
Since that Monday night I have not commented on this matter publicly. I thought I had an obligation to consider the President's admissions more objectively, less personally, and to try to put them in a clearer perspective. And I felt that I owed that much to the President, for whom I have great affection and admiration, and who I truly believe has worked tirelessly to make life tangibly better in so many ways for so many Americans. 
But the truth is that, after much reflection, my feelings of disappointment and anger have not dissipated, except now these feelings have gone beyond my personal dismay to a larger, graver sense of loss for our country, a reckoning of the damage that the President's conduct has done to the proud legacy of his Presidency, and ultimately an accounting of the impact of his actions on our democracy and its moral foundations. The implications for our country are so serious that I feel a responsibility to my constituents in Connecticut, as well as to my conscience, to voice my concerns forthrightly and publicly. And I can think of no more appropriate place to do that than on this great Senate floor. 
I have chosen to speak particularly at this time before the independent counsel files his report because, while we do not know enough yet to answer the question of whether there are legal consequences of the President's conduct, we do know enough from what the President acknowledged on August 17 to answer a separate and distinct set of questions about the moral consequences for our country. Mr. President, I have come to this floor many times in the past to speak with my colleagues about the concerns which are so widely shared in this Chamber and throughout the Nation that our society's standards are sinking; 
that our common moral code is deteriorating and that our public life is coarsening. 
In doing so, I have specifically criticized leaders of the entertainment industry for the way they have used the enormous influence they wield to weaken our common values. And now, because the President commands at least as much attention and exerts at least as much influence on our collective consciousness as any Hollywood celebrity or television show, it is hard to ignore the impact of the misconduct the President has admitted to on our culture, on our character and on our children. 
To begin with, I must respectfully disagree with the President's contention that his relationship with Monica Lewinsky and the way in which he misled us about it is nobody's business but his family's and that even Presidents have private lives, as he said. 
Whether he or we think it fair or not, the reality is in 1998 that a President's private life is public. Contemporary news media standards will have it no other way. Surely, this President was given fair notice of that by the amount of time the news media has dedicated to investigating his personal life during the 1992 campaign and in the years since. 
But there is more to this than modern media intrusiveness. The President is not just the elected leader of our country. He is, as Presidential scholar Clinton Rossiter observed, `The one-man distillation of the American people,' and as President Taft said at another time, `The personal embodiment and representative of their dignity and majesty.' So when his personal conduct is embarrassing, it is sadly so not just for him and his family, it is embarrassing for all of us as Americans. 
The President is a role model who, because of his prominence and the moral authority that emanates from his office, sets standards of behavior for the people he serves. His duty, as the Reverand Nathan Baxter of the National Cathedral here in Washington said in a recent sermon, `is nothing less than the stewardship of our values.' So no matter how much the President or others may wish to compartmentalize the different spheres of his life, the inescapable truth is that the President's private conduct can and often does have profound public consequences. 
In this case, the President apparently had extramarital relations with an employee half his age and did so in the workplace, in the vicinity of the Oval Office. Such behavior is not just inappropriate, it is immoral and it is harmful, for it sends a message of what is acceptable behavior to the larger American family, particularly to our children, which is as influential as the negative message that is communicated by the entertainment culture. 
If you doubt that, just ask America's parents about the intimate and frequently unseemly sexual questions their young children have been asking them about and discussing since the President's relationship with Ms. Lewinsky became public 7 months ago. I have had many of those conversations with parents, particularly in Connecticut, and from them I conclude that parents across our country feel much as I do that something very sad and sordid has happened in American life when I cannot watch the news on television with my 10-year-old daughter anymore. 
This, unfortunately, is all too familiar territory for America's families in today's `anything goes' culture, where sexual promiscuity is too often treated as just another lifestyle choice with little risk of adverse consequences. It is this mindset that has helped to threaten the integrity and stability of the family which continues to be the most important unit of civilized society, the place where we raise our children and teach them to be responsible citizens, to develop and nurture their personal and moral faculties. 
President Clinton, in fact, has shown during the course of his Presidency that he understands this and the broad concern in the public about the threat to the family. He has used the bully pulpit of his Presidency to eloquently and effectively call for the renewal of our common values, particularly the principle of personal responsibility and our common commitment to family. He has spoken out admirably against sexual promiscuity among teenagers in clear terms of right and wrong, emphasizing the consequences involved. 
All of that makes the President's misconduct so confusing and so damaging. The President's relationship with Ms. Lewinsky not only contradicted the values he has publicly embraced over the last 6 years, it has, I fear, compromised his moral authority at a time when Americans of every political persuasion agree that the decline of the family is one of the most pressing problems we are facing. 
Nevertheless, I believe that the President could have lessened the harm his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky has caused if he had acknowledged his mistake and spoken with candor about it to the American people shortly after it became public in January. But, as we now know, he chose not to do this. This deception is particularly troubling because it was not just a reflexive and, in many ways, understandable human act of concealment to protect himself and his family from what he called the embarrassment of his own conduct when he was confronted with it in the deposition in the Jones case, but rather it was the intentional and premeditated decision to do so. 
In choosing this path, I fear that the President has undercut the efforts of millions of American parents who are naturally trying to instill in our children the value of honesty. As most any mother and father knows, kids have a singular ability to detect double standards. So we can safely assume that it will be that much more difficult to convince our sons and daughters of the importance of telling the truth when the most powerful man in the Nation evades it. 
Many parents I have spoken with in Connecticut confirm this unfortunate consequence. The President's intentional and consistent statements more deeply may also undercut the trust that the American people have in his word. 
Under the Constitution, as Presidential scholar Richard Neustadt has noted, the President's ultimate source of authority, particularly his moral authority, is the power to persuade, to mobilize public opinion, to build consensus behind a common agenda, and at this the President has been extraordinarily effective. But that power hinges on the President's support among the American people and their faith and confidence in his motivations and agenda, yes, but also in his word. As Teddy Roosevelt once explained, `My power vanishes into thin air the instant that my fellow citizens, who are straight and honest, cease to believe that I represent them and fight for what is straight and honest. That is all the strength that I have.' 
Sadly, with his deception, President Clinton may have weakened the great power and strength that he possesses of which President Roosevelt spoke. I know this is a concern that many of my colleagues share, which is to say that the President has hurt his credibility and, therefore, perhaps his chances of moving his policy agenda forward. 
But I believe that the harm the President's actions have caused extend beyond the political arena. 
I am afraid that the misconduct the President has admitted may be reinforcing one of the worst messages being delivered by our popular culture, which is that values are fungible. And I am concerned that his misconduct may help to blur some of the most bright lines of right and wrong in our society. 
Mr. President, I said at the outset that this was a very difficult statement to write and deliver. That is true, very true. And it is true, in large part, because it is so personal and yet needs to be public, but also because of my fear that it will appear unnecessarily judgmental. I truly regret this. I know from the Bible that only God can judge people. The most that we can do is to comment, without condemning individuals. And in this case I have tried to comment on the consequences of the President's conduct on our country. 
I know that the President is far from alone in the wrongdoing he has admitted. We, as humans, are all imperfect. We are all sinners. Many have betrayed a loved one, and most have told lies. Members of Congress have certainly been guilty of such behavior, as have some previous Presidents. We must try to understand the complexity and difficulty of personal relationships, which should give us pause before passing judgment on them. We all fall short of the standards our best values set for us. Certainly I do. 
But the President, by virtue of the office he sought and was elected to, has traditionally been held to a higher standard. This is as it should be. Because the American President, as I quoted earlier, is not just the one-man distillation of the American people but today the most powerful person in the world, and, as such, the consequences of his misbehavior, even private misbehavior, are much greater than that of an average citizen, a CEO, or even a Senator. 
That is what I believe Presidential scholar James David Barber, in his book `The Presidential Character,' was getting at when he wrote that the public demands `a sense of legitimacy from, and in, the Presidency * * * There is more to this than dignity, more than propriety. The President is expected to personify our betterness in an inspiring way, to express in what he does and is (not just what he says) a moral idealism which, in much of the public mind, is the very opposite of politics.' 
Just as the American people are demanding of their leaders, though, they are also fundamentally fair and forgiving, which is why I was so hopeful the President could begin to repair the damage done with his address to the Nation on the 17th. But like so many others, I came away feeling that, for reasons that are thoroughly human, he missed a great opportunity that night. 
He failed to clearly articulate to the American people that he recognized how significant and consequential his wrongdoing was and how badly he felt about it. He failed to show, I think, that he understood his behavior had diminished the office he holds and the country he serves and that it is inconsistent with the mainstream American values that he has advanced as President. 
And I regret that he failed to acknowledge that while Mr. Starr and Ms. Lewinsky, Mrs. Tripp, and the news media have each in their own way contributed to the crisis we now face, his Presidency would not be in peril if it had not been for the behavior he himself described as `wrong' and `inappropriate.' 
Because the conduct the President admitted to that night was serious and his assumption of responsibility inadequate, the last 3 weeks have been dominated by a cacophony of media and political voices calling for impeachment or resignation or censure, while a lesser chorus implores us to `move on' and get this matter behind us. 
Appealing as that latter option may be to many people who are understandably weary of this crisis, the transgressions the President has admitted to are too consequential for us to walk away and leave the impression for our children today and for our posterity tomorrow that what he acknowledges he did within the White House is acceptable behavior for our Nation's leader. 
On the contrary, as I have said, it is wrong and unacceptable and should be followed by some measure of public rebuke and accountability. We in Congress--elected representatives of all the American people--are surely capable institutionally of expressing such disapproval through a resolution of reprimand or censure of the President for his misconduct, but it is premature to do so, as my colleagues of both parties seem to agree, until we have received the report of the independent counsel and the White House's response to it. 
In the same way, it seems to me that talk of impeachment and resignation at this time is unjust and unwise. It is unjust because we do not know enough in fact, and will not until the independent counsel reports and the White House responds, to conclude whether we have crossed the high threshold our Constitution rightly sets for overturning the results of a popular election in our democracy and bringing on the national trauma of removing an incumbent President from office. 
For now, in fact, all we know for certain is what the President acknowledged on August 17. As far as I can see, the rest is rumor, speculation, or hearsay--much less than is required by Members of the House and Senate in the dispatch of the solemn responsibilities that the Constitution gives us in such circumstances. 
I believe the talk of impeachment and resignation now is unwise because it ignores the reality that, while the independent counsel proceeds with his investigation, the President is still our Nation's leader, our Commander in Chief. Economic uncertainty and other problems here at home, as well as the fiscal and political crises in Russia and Asia, and the growing threats posed by Iraq, North Korea, and worldwide terrorism, all demand the President's focused leadership. For that reason, while the legal process moves forward, I believe it is important that we provide the President with the time and space and support he needs to carry out his most important duties and protect our national interest and security. 
That time and space may also give the President additional opportunities to accept personal responsibility for his behavior, to rebuild public trust in his leadership, to recommit himself to the values of opportunity, responsibility, and community that brought him to office, and to act to heal the wounds in our national character. 
In the meantime, as the debate on this matter proceeds, and as the investigation goes forward, we would all be advised, I would respectfully suggest, to heed the wisdom of Abraham Lincoln's second annual address to Congress in 1862. With the Nation at war with itself, President Lincoln warned:  
If there ever could be a proper time for mere catch arguments, that time is surely not now. In times like the present, men should utter nothing for which they would not willingly be responsible through time and eternity. 
I believe that we are at such a time again today. With so much at stake, we too must resist the impulse toward `catch arguments' and reflex reactions. Let us proceed in accordance with our Nation's traditional moral compass, yes, but in a manner that is fair and at a pace that is deliberate and responsible. 
Let us, as a nation, honestly confront the damage that the President's actions over the last 7 months have caused, but not to the exclusion of the good that his leadership has done over the past 6 years nor at the expense of our common interest as Americans. And let us be guided by the conscience of the Constitution, which calls on us to place the common good above any partisan or personal interest, 
as we now in our time work together to resolve this serious challenge to our democracy. 
I thank the Chair. I thank my colleagues. I yield the floor.

Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I regret that on behalf of the minority leader we must object to the unanimous consent that was just propounded. On this side Members are working to try to find a way to make some progress on this matter and a number of matters related to criminal justice that also need attention. So I must, therefore, formally object.

Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Senator from South Dakota. 
If I may, before posing my question, I want to reflect upon an experience I had last year as a member of the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee which held extensive hearings into this subject matter of the 1996 campaign and how it was financed. And I must say as I look back to it, the mental image I have of it is being waist deep in muck and fighting our way through it. It was a stunning, mind-altering, ultimately embarrassing experience, to see what has happened to our great democracy and the extent to which, at a time when we question the public's trust in government, we have created a system that amounts to evasion of law clearly by lawmakers, by all of us in the lawmaking class, by those who are running for office. 
And why do I say that? What became clear in those hearings, we have laws, we have laws that limit the amount of money that individuals can give to campaigns--$2,000 per individual. We have laws that limit the amount that a political action committee can give--$10,000 in the whole cycle--to a given campaign. We have laws that prohibit corporations and unions from contributing to political campaigns. It could not be clearer. And then there is created this so-called soft money loophole through which is driven not a Mack truck, a whole division, a whole army which has obliterated the limits. 
So we have individuals giving hundreds of thousands of dollars, we have corporations and unions giving millions of dollars, we make a mockery of the law, and we have just the effect the Senator from South Dakota and the Senator from Illinois have just talked about, which is quite the opposite of reform here--restricting people's rights. 
The reality, the place we have come to, the sad place we 
have come to, limits individual rights and, even more underneath that, the individual American's confidence that he or she has the same ability roughly as every other American to affect their Government. Why? You don't have to be a rocket scientist or a political scientist to come to the belief that an individual or a group that can give hundreds of thousands of dollars has more access to their Government than the average American does. 
I remember that during the debate we had--one of the earlier debates we had on this subject--one of our colleagues brought out a chart, and to me it told a lot of the story, and it responds to, I know, some of the conclusions made by Members of the Senate that the public doesn't really care about campaign finance reform. I disagree. When you ask people what problems they are most worried about, campaign finance reform is not going to come out on the top of that list, in part because I think there is a misapprehension. I read a quote last year from somebody who said, `Oh, campaign finance reform. Well, I care more about how they spend my tax money than how they raise their campaign money.' The reality is that how campaign money is raised, as we have seen here and the leader has spoken to quite eloquently--how campaign money is raised affects how their tax money is spent and who pays taxes. 
But look, we are leaders. We were elected to do what we think is right. We were elected to build confidence in our Government. So hopefully we will respond to more than just polls here. 
The chart that I referred to earlier that one of our colleagues brought out had two lines on it. One showed the trend line of contributions to American political campaigns. The other showed the trend line of the turnout of Americans in voting--startling difference. As the money goes up, the public participation in elections goes down because people don't think their vote counts anymore. 
I say to the Senator from South Dakota, as I think about the situation, as I know we got 52 votes for the McCain-Feingold bill here, and we were all raised to believe the will of the majority prevails in our democracy, it is not so in the Senate apparently. In the House, much to everybody's surprise--and I must say with some pride, due in good measure to the great leadership given by Congressman Chris Shays of Connecticut--the Shays-Meehan bill passed. 
We have another opportunity to right this wrong. The problem is not going to go away. Just in the last week, the Attorney General has commenced initial inquiries that relate to campaign finance practices in 1996. And I can't believe after all that we have learned, after all that the media has told us, after all that we know--because as the Senator from South Dakota has said, it is our lives; we are being pulled by the money chase away from what should be the focus of our interest, which is the people's business--I can't believe that we are going to end this 105th session of Congress without doing something to reform our campaign finance laws. 
So my question to the Senator from South Dakota, with thanks for his persistent leadership on this serious matter, is--well, two really. One, in the course of the Senator's career, if we are not able to pass campaign finance reform in this session, would the Senator not agree that this is one of the most grievous abdications of this Chamber's responsibility in a long time faced with a real problem? And second, I suppose, does the leader agree that part of what is needed here is for the public to speak to their elected leaders and plead with them, particularly in the Senate, those of our colleagues who can take us either to a vote or from 52 to 60 to break the filibuster, that it really matters to them that we adopt campaign finance reform this year?

 Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I am delighted to join Senators Chafee, Graham, Specter, and Baucus to introduce the Promoting Responsible Managed Care Act of 1998. Our bill is a bipartisan effort that we believe can be enacted this year. 
Our effort is modest in authorship because we have chosen to draw from both Republican and Democratic bills, but bold in goal. We aim to bring protections to 161 million Americans without delay before this Congress adjourns. Included in those bold protections are new rights of access to specialists, access to independent grievance and appeals, quality report cards, and compensation if a plan's actions result in their injury. Excluded are those provisions, even some with appeal, that are likely to prevent any Congressional action on patients' rights this year. 
Over the last decade we have crossed over a turbulent river of change in health care. The raging cost escalation of the 80's and 90's buffeted families and tore away an ever increasing share of their paycheck to pay for health insurance coverage. Some couldn't afford the price, and lost their hold on health care--for themselves and their families. 
Today, the on flowing health care costs have slowed, but left behind permanent changes in the health care shoreline. We have a tool that has dammed up health care costs--managed care. Yet, after more than a decade of cost increases, we have over forty-one million uninsured among us that can't afford coverage. We need to be mindful of these uninsured and the millions close to losing their insurance whenever we intervene in the health care market in ways that raise costs. 
Managed care has calmed the rise in medical costs that buffeted us so badly and brought double-digit inflation under control. The average rate of increase of costs of medical plans dropped 10 percent between 1991 and 1996. Without managed care, costs would be higher, millions more would be uninsured, and wages and salaries would be lower. 
Today over 75 percent of Americans who receive their health coverage through their employer are in some form of managed care. Consumers no longer have a family doctor--they have a gatekeeper. They don't pick a physician--they (or in most cases, their employer) pick a network. A family's access to care, to drugs, to specialists all can be limited by the managed care organization. 
Now that cost increases have slowed, it is also time to focus on health care quality. Many people are nervous about the quality of their managed care plans. They are concerned that the success of managed care in containing costs, has come at the expense of health care quality. 
People want to know that they can get health care for their children from pediatricians, go see a specialist if their condition warrants some special attention, even go the emergency room if they feel that it is necessary. 
They want to know that they aren't going to be locked out of medical care by an unresponsive managed care bureaucracy, vainly calling an unanswered phone to get approval for necessary medical care. 
The entry of managed care into the health care marketplace has created competition that has lowered prices, enabling better access for millions to health care. But we also need to introduce competition over quality into this marketplace. 
Our bill covers all 161 million Americans who are privately-insured. It includes patient protection standards to protect patient's access to the physician of their choice including women's access to obstetrical/gynecological specialists, a childs to a pediatrician, and other patients to specialists such as oncologists pursuant to a treatment plan. 
It protects continuity of care, so that patients can continue to see their physician through an illness or pregnancy despite changes in the managed care network. 
Plans would be prohibited from using `gag rules' to restrict physicians communication with their patients. 
Visits to emergency rooms would be covered based on the `prudent layperson' standard and would include reimbursement for post stabilization and maintenance care. 
Most important, we have included strong enforcement to protect these rights and protect the health and lives of all 161 privately insured Americans. 
We have four important enforcement rights. We give consumers the right to obtain performance information so they don't get trapped in a bad health plan in the first place, establish a new grievance and appeals process so that consumers have a speedy process and fair setting to seek needed healthcare, give the U.S. Department of Labor and Health and Human Services the right to place heavy fines on health plans that don't protect patients, and finally, if all three fail, give the patient new rights to sue for compensation in federal courts if all the new protections fail and they are injured as the result of a decision by their managed care plan. 
Our first enforcement tool is to empower consumer choice based on accurate, comparable information with information about their health care options. Millions of American healthcare consumers can get more information about the quality of a toaster oven or a candy bar than about their health plan. Report cards on health care quality should be the rule not the exception. Consumers who choose between plans, employers who purchase them, and plans and providers who compete for business will all drive up quality if report cards on their performance become the rule not the exception. 
Some of the large employers in my state joined together years ago to hold health plans accountable. These companies stood up to say before they would even offer a health plan to their employees, that plan would have to agree to provide their record of performance and outcome on critical services such as breast cancer screening, prenatal care, asthma and diabetic treatment. 
Workers at these companies now choose the plan with the best performance for them. All workers in America should have that right. It drives up quality and drives down bad managed care plans. 
We require that all health plans be held accountable by reporting how well they are doing in providing the services that keep people healthy. We allow the Secretary to develop requirements that will work for different types of insurance, but get critical quality information to workers and purchasers. Although Senator Nickles' bill includes voluminous information requirements, nowhere does he ask for the most critical information--how good a job is a health plan doing in keeping members of that plan healthy and alive. 
Our second enforcement tool gives consumers in a health plan the right to appeal a denial of coverage to a independent, external panel of fair-minded experts under specific, quick deadlines. 
When consumers need health care services, delays and indecision can be critical. The appeals process protects patients health by getting decisions made quickly and services provided before their medical condition worsens. No longer will consumers and their doctors spend months or even years fighting through a morass of managed care bureaucrats none of whom seem accountable, and all of whom add their own dollop of delay to a final decision. 
We have adopted the `gold standard' set by the Medicare program which guarantees an answer in 72 hours or less for urgent care, and in less than one month for even the most routine decisions. Consumers have full rights to appeal any denial of care--both internally and to an external body for a completely independent review. 
Third, we fix ERISA--a law that was enacted in 1974--so that it no longer blunts enforcement of patient protections. Under current law there are no meaningful enforcement remedies available to Americans who get their insurance through their employers. The U.S. Departments of Labor and Health and Human Services can do little to carry out their enforcement responsibilities. Individuals can not seek compensation when their health care plan makes a decision that injures them. A person, grievously harmed by their plan, can only sue for the cost of the benefit wrongly denied. For example, under current ERISA law, a mother on death's bed with cancer wrongly denied. For example, under current ERISA law, a mother on death's bed with cancer because she didn't get a mammogram would only be able to sue her health plan for the cost of the mammogram. 
The Democrats have chosen to address this problem by allowing participants in ERISA plans to seek redress, including uncapped punitive damages, in state courts, an absolute nonstarter with the Republicans. The Republican plan simply extends the enforcement mechanism provided under current law, which is to say the cost of the benefit denied, and have thrown in a small additional fine of $100 a day in cases where a health plan refuses to comply with the decision of the external appeal entity. $100 is a cruel compensation for a family that has lost a breadwinner through the botched denial of coverage of a managed care plan. 
We believe it is vitally important for Congress to step up to the plate with a real federal patient rights enforcement. In order to ensure that plans abide by the new patient protections in our bill, we give new civil money penalty and injunctive relief authority to the Secretaries of Health and Human Services and Labor. Plans that violate the law can be compelled to pay for it--up to $250,000. 
Finally, there will be those tragic instances where our broad, new protections fail. A person is injured despite their new rights and powers and the managed care organization is at fault. Under our plan, people can take their plan to court, and sue that plan for the full amount of any damages equal to their economic loss plus attorney's fees. The injured person can get back the loss of earnings or other benefits related to employment, medical expense loss, replacement services loss, loss due to death, burial costs, and loss of business or employment opportunities, caused by the coverage determination of the managed care plan. For the injured person and their family, the dollars probably can never compensate for the loss of health, but we think that it is critical that at least their economic losses by paid when a plan causes the injury. 
That is our plan, a stronghold of patient rights protected by four well-buttressed walls of individual and government enforcement. We have given patients the strongest tools at our disposal--information, appeal rights, agency enforcement, and access to the courts. Our proposal has these strengths, but not the baggage of provisions that partisans of either party I fear may use to prevent congressional action. I urge the passage of the Promoting Responsible Managed Care Act of 1998 so that 161 million Americans can receive its protections without delay.

Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the bill we are about to take up and vote upon, the Biomaterials Access Assurance Act. I am proud to have co-sponsored the Senate version of this bill with Senator McCain. We have worked together on this bill for a number of years now, and it is quite gratifying to see it now about to move toward enactment. 
Mr. President, the Biomaterials bill is the response to a crisis affecting more than 7 million Americans annually who rely on implantable life-saving or life-enhancing medical devices--things like pacemakers, heart valves, artificial blood vessels, hydrocephalic shunts, and hip and knee joints. They are at risk of losing access to the devices because many companies that supply the raw materials and component parts that go into the devices are refusing to sell them to device manufacturers. Why? Because suppliers no longer want to risk having to pay enormous legal fees to defend against product liability suits when those legal fees far exceed any profit they make from supplying the raw materials for use in implantable devices. 
Let me emphasize that I am speaking here about--and the bill addresses--the suppliers of raw materials and component parts--not about the companies that make the medical devices themselves. The materials these suppliers sell--things like resins and yarns--are basically generic materials that they sell for a variety of uses in many, many different products. Their sales to device manufacturers usually make up only a very small part of their markets--often less than one percent. As a result--and because of the small amount of the materials that go into the implants--many of these suppliers make very little money from supplying implant manufacturers. Just as importantly, these suppliers generally have nothing to do with the design, manufacture or sale of the product. 
But despite the fact that they generally have nothing to do with making the product, because of the common practice of suing everyone involved in any way with a product when something goes wrong, these suppliers sometimes get brought into lawsuits claiming problems with the implants. One company, for example, was hauled into to 651 lawsuits involving 1,605 implant recipients based on a total of 5 cents worth of that company's product in each implant. In other words, in exchange for selling less than $100 of its product, this supplier received a bill for perhaps millions of dollars of legal fees it spent in its ultimately successful effort to defend against these lawsuits. 
The results from such experiences should not surprise anyone. Even though not a single biomaterials supplier has ultimately been held liable so far--let me say that again: Not a single biomaterials supplier has ultimately been held liable so far--the message nevertheless is clear for any rational business. Why would any business stay in a market that yields them little profit, but exposes them to huge legal costs? An April 1997 study of this issue found that 75 percent of suppliers surveyed were not willing to sell their raw materials to implant manufacturers under current conditions. That study predicts that unless this trend is reversed, patients whose lives depend on implantable devices may no longer have access to them. 
What is at stake here, let me be clear, is not protecting suppliers from liability and not even just making raw materials available to the manufacturers of medical devices. Those things in and of themselves might not be enough to bring me here. What is at stake is the health and lives of millions of Americans who depend on medical devices for their every day survival. What is at stake are the lives of children with hydrocephalus who rely on brain shunts to keep fluid from accumulating around their brains. What is at stake are the lives of adults whose hearts would stop beating without implanted automatic defibrillators. What is at stake are the lives of seniors who need pacemakers because their hearts no longer generate enough of an electrical pulse to get their heart to beat. Without implants, none of these individuals could survive. 
We must do something soon to deal with this problem. We simply cannot allow the current situation to continue to put at risk the millions of Americans who owe their health to medical devices. 
Senator McCain, and I and the bill's sponsors in the House have crafted what we think is a reasonable response to this problem. Our bill would do two things. First, with an important exception I'll talk about in a minute, the bill would immunize suppliers of raw materials and component parts from product liability suits, unless the supplier falls into one of three categories: (1) the supplier also manufactured the implant alleged to have caused harm; (2) the supplier sold the implant alleged to have caused harm; or (3) the supplier furnished raw materials or component parts that failed to meet applicable contractual requirements or specifications. 
Second, the bill would provide suppliers with a mechanism for making that immunity meaningful by obtaining early dismissal from lawsuits. By guaranteeing suppliers in advance that they will not face needless litigation costs, this bill should spur suppliers to remain in or come back to the biomaterials market, and so ensure that people who need implantable medical devices will still have access to them. 
Now, it is important to emphasize that in granting suppliers immunity, we would not be depriving anyone injured by a defective implantable medical device of the right to compensation for their injuries. Injured parties still will have their full rights against anyone involved in the design, manufacture or sale of an implant, and they can sue implant manufacturers, or any other allegedly responsible party, and collect for their injuries from them if that party is at fault. 
We also have added a new provision to this version of the bill, one that resulted from lengthy negotiations with representatives of the implant manufacturers, the American Trial Lawyers Association--ATLA--the White House and others. This provision responds to concerns that the previous version of the bill would have left injured implant recipients without a means of seeking compensation if the manufacturer or other responsible party is bankrupt or otherwise judgment-proof. As now drafted, the bill provides that in such cases, a plaintiff may bring the raw materials supplier back into a lawsuit after judgment if a court concludes that evidence exists to warrant holding the supplier liable. 
Finally, let me add that the bill does not cover lawsuits involving silicone gel breast implants. 
In short, Mr. President, the Biomaterials bill is--and I am not engaging in hyperbole when I say this--potentially a matter of life and death for the millions of Americans who rely on implantable medical devices to survive. This bill would make sure that implant manufacturers still have access to the raw materials they need for their products, while at the same time ensuring that those injured by implants are able to get compensation for injuries caused by defective implants. This is a good bill, and I urge my colleagues to support it.

Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Chair. 
Mr. President, it has struck me often in my 10 years here in the Senate that one can look at the life we lead here in different ways. In one sense, in a sense that is most visible, we do the work of the country: We hold hearings, we meet with constituents, we legislate. This is the Congress of the United States. 
But in another sense, it has struck me increasingly over the years I have been honored to be here that there is another level of experience in this Capitol, which is that we are, in our own way, a small town of our own. We are a community. Yes, we have the Members of Congress and we have all who serve in our offices so well. We have the officers of both Chambers and those who work to keep these Chambers going. But there is a broader community here that we are all part of. It is the people who keep the buildings in such good repair. 
We have doctors, we have nurses, we have clergy people, we have representatives of the media who live in this community with us who cover us. We even have our own newspapers. And we have police officers. We are a small town in the way that life is lived in so many small towns across America. But we are very different from most any of those small towns in that hundreds of thousands of fellow Americans--indeed, people from all over the world--come and walk through this great citadel of democracy, this great symbol of freedom, peacefully and respectfully, coming through our community. 
On Friday, as we all know, one madman disrupted the tranquility of our community and took two of our own, Special Agent John Gibson, Officer Jacob Chestnut. There is a sense of palpable sadness and grief in this Capitol today, a sense of mourning at the loss of these two officers, because they were members of our community. We saw them every day. We exchanged greetings with them. We deeply regret and in some ways, I am sure, feel anger at what happened on Friday to take these two fine men, these two heroes, from us. 
As we mourn their loss, I do think it is important for us to remember the extraordinary and unique war that law enforcement officers play in this small town, our little community, the Capitol of the United States, which is similar to the part they play in every other community across America. Think of what happened in those few tragic, jolting moments on Friday afternoon when danger occurred and the sound of bullets resonated through the halls of the Capitol. Most everyone in the Capitol ran for cover, locked their office doors, jumped under tables and desks, got out of the way of danger. But the law enforcement officers, the Capitol Police throughout this Capitol, including these two fallen heroes, rushed to the danger. That is their job, to protect the rest of us. It is an extraordinary difference in a quiet, normal moment on a midsummer Friday afternoon. Suddenly, one madman pierces all of that, and every officer, every Capitol Police officer in our small town, rushes to the danger, rushes to their duty station. These two responded with instinctive but extraordinary, heroic impulses to stop this man, and ultimately did, and save so many lives through their heroism. 
Mr. President, I mentioned this just to pay tribute in some small way to Special Agent Gibson and Officer Chestnut, but to remind us how much we owe these people in this small town of ours, and in every city and town across America, and why we ought not to just treat them with a warm hello but feel, as we do today, in some measure every day the gratitude we have to them and express that in the best way we can, which is not only as friends and fellow citizens of our communities, but when we have a chance, as employers, to treat them appropriately and according to the extraordinary responsibilities that they bear in a moment of crisis. 
Mr. President, by coincidence this morning, I was reading from Jeremiah's Book of Lamentations and I read the commentary on Lamentations in which were cited the comments of an ancient rabbi who was interpreting the Psalms, David's Book of Psalms. In dealing with the sadness, the sense of gloom that is so at the heart of the Book of Lamentations, this sage of old, in commenting on Psalms, expressed a thought that is familiar to all religions, which is, `If I had not fallen, I could never have arisen. If I had not sat in darkness, I could never have seen the light of God.' 
So in this time of deep and heavy darkness for our community here on Capitol Hill, we pray with faith together and the faith that unites us in our community, unites us as faith has always united people in American communities, that Special Agent Gibson and Officer Chestnut are seeing the light of God, that they are being welcomed in the warm embrace of eternal life, greeted as the heroes that they are. We pray, also, that God will grant strength and comfort to their families, to their friends, to their fellow officers in the Capitol Police corps, and in some measure to all of us in this small town, Capitol Hill, who, today, mourn their loss. 
I thank the Chair and I yield the floor.

Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to offer this bipartisan amendment, a sense-of-the-Senate resolution expressing our concern about the impact of Japan's recession on the economies of East Asia, Southeast Asia and the United States, and particularly appealing to the members--our colleagues and friends--of the Liberal Democratic Party in Japan, which is meeting tomorrow to choose their new president, who will in turn become the next Prime Minister of Japan--to be mindful of the very profound and friendly concern that we have in the U.S. Senate about the condition of the Japanese economy, about its impact on the people of Japan, of Asia, and indeed, of the United States. 
I am privileged to offer this bipartisan amendment on behalf of Senators Thomas, Graham, Lugar, Bingaman, Brownback, Durbin, Kohl, Reid, Mack, Breaux and Inhofe. 
For almost a half century, the United States has worked with Japan for the common goals of peace, stability, democracy and prosperity in East Asia and the world. However, in the face of the deepening Asian economic crisis, this alliance currently faces what may be its toughest challenge yet. 
So far, the United States has survived the Asian crisis relatively unscathed, thanks to our long-lived boom economy. But I fear that good fortune may now be ending. By some estimates, worldwide GDP growth will drop from 3.7 percent this year to 2.4 percent next year. Analysts have attributed plummeting commodity prices to the Asian crisis in this country and throughout the world. A major dropoff in demand for U.S. products in Asia has pushed the trade deficit well beyond expectations to a record $15.75 billion--15 and three-quarters billion--this May. Industrial production in OECD countries like the United States has fallen from 5 percent to 2 percent and is expected to fall further again to 1 percent. 
The slide of Asian currencies against the dollar has put serious competitive pressures on our exports and another round of competitive devaluations would have devastating consequences on our industries and our workers. 
Unquestionably, Mr. President, if the Asian recession continues, its impact on our economy will worsen and millions of Americans will feel what is happening in Japan and Asia. 
This bipartisan resolution emphasizes that the strong recovery of the Japanese economy, which remains by far the largest in Asia, comprising fully two-thirds of the Asian economy, will make or break the region. With every subsequent analysis, the economic picture in Japan darkens. 
Japan's financial system has fundamental flaws which have only recently been brought to light, but which most everyone now acknowledges, and the wide scope of their ramifications continues to unsettle and surprise economists. Bad bank loans in Japan account for $574 billion in debt in banks in Japan which claimed to be solvent only recently, a problem which is perpetuated by a weak auditing system. Formal and informal barriers severely restrict free competition, often holding foreign market share in certain sectors down below 5 percent. The yen continues to fall, down 45 percent against the dollar since 1995. Further devaluation of the yen could lead to a devaluation of the Chinese yuan, an event which would have significant ramifications, and bad ones, for the entire global economy, particularly for us in the United States. 
All of these factors have led to substantial and understandable dissatisfaction among the Japanese people which they expressed earlier this month, with surprising clarity to many people, in a historic election for the Upper House of Parliament. The ruling Liberal Democratic Party lost 17 of its 61 seats and the primary opposition party, the Democratic Party of Japan, picked up nine members to reach a total of 47 seats in the Upper House. These election results should be taken very seriously in the United States. The situation is bad in Japan, the people of Japan know it, and without change, it will get worse. 
It is today axiomatic that we live and work in a global economy. When an economic crisis of this magnitude hits a country as large and significant as Japan, the entire world feels the impact; particularly we feel it. Japan is, after all, our second largest trading partner. Japan imported almost $66 billion of American goods last year. That is more than four times the import of American goods into China, in spite of its much larger population. With 40 percent of American total agricultural product going abroad, the Asian economic crisis is, of course, having a very negative impact on American farmers. 
It is no surprise that we are suffering along with East Asia. Without a rally by the Asian economies, American growth will fall off. By all accounts, a stable Japan is the first significant step to a broader Asian recovery. 
Mr. President, I do want to indicate to my colleagues and the managers of the bill, I am prepared to yield the floor at any point if anyone wishes to proceed. If the managers have other business they want to do at this time, I am prepared to put the rest of my statement in the Record. If not, I will be equally prepared to proceed. I thank the managers, noting the nod from the Democratic floor manager. 
Japan has taken steps to address its economic troubles. Economic stimulus packages and structural reform committees have been set in place. However, both the vast extent of the reforms necessary and the current political turnover including the resignation of Prime Minister Hashimoto after the election returns, which I have just described, make it imperative that we in the United States place our full support behind the forces of change, bold change, in Japan, lest they lose momentum. 
Swift reform hopefully will be a priority in relations between our two nations. We know, of course, the President has been in touch with the leadership of Japan. Secretary Rubin has done the same. 
And it seems only proper, and in some sense is necessary, that the Congress of the United States make clear its broad-based concern for the current economic condition of Japan--and here on the eve of the Liberal Democratic Party elections tomorrow, it is our deep hope, our plea, that change be implemented. 
So today, along with the distinguished group of Members of both parties, whose names I mentioned earlier, I am pleased to offer this resolution to express to our President and to the Government of Japan that the Senate of the United States is following Japan's economic performance with increasing anxiety and is very concerned about the pressure that Japan's current economic crisis is putting on our overall bilateral relationship. 
While we applaud efforts in Japan in assessing the damage and beginning the reform, we need to maintain a strong position supporting the implementation of those reforms, even though we know they will be painful. The resolution that we submit today cites a number of fundamental reforms crucial to recovery in Japan and Asia, including deregulation of the Japanese economy, liberating the creative, innovative forces that are there, improvement of market access for foreign entities wishing to do business in Japan, enforcement of fair trade, and particularly bold and substantial banking reform. 
These are all actions which will increase the competitiveness of the Japanese market and of Japanese companies, providing greater opportunities for foreign investment in Japan and for the success of individual Japanese and foreign entrepreneurs. 
Mr. President, a more open and healthy Japanese economy is fundamental to the recovery of the entire Asian region. 
Seeing no one else on the floor, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 1 more minute to complete this statement.

Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Chair. 
Long into the foreseeable future, Japan will remain one of our most important economic trading partners and strategic allies in the world, sharing our common goals of regional and worldwide prosperity and peace. The importance of our alliance, though, compels us to speak out and place our support behind the most innovative reform efforts in Japan and push for a swift resolution of the economic crisis there. 
Earlier this week, the House passed a similar resolution with the overwhelming support of 391 Members--only 2 opposed. Given the urgency of the issue and the value of a unified congressional position, I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan resolution. 
I thank the Chair and yield the floor.

Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, little more than 24 hours from now, the members of the Liberal Democratic Party will be meeting in Japan to choose their new head, who will in turn become the next Prime Minister of Japan. In that sense, this resolution, which I have been privileged to introduce with a bipartisan group of cosponsors, the principal cosponsor being Senator Thomas of Wyoming, the chairman of the Asian Subcommittee of Foreign Relations, this resolution could not come at a better time. It recognizes the importance of our bilateral relationship with Japan, perhaps the most important bilateral relationship we have. It notes the economic crisis in Japan and the way in which it is beginning to affect our economy. Commodity prices are dropping; our import-export balance is being affected; our trade deficit is going up. 
It appeals to the leadership of our great ally, Japan, as the Liberal Democratic Party meets tomorrow, to not just choose a new leader but to choose a new bold course which will directly address the economic crisis in that country which is now affecting us. I urge a strong bipartisan vote on this as a message to our friends in Japan.

Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to bring my colleagues attention to the excellent work being done by an important international organization--the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). Since 1961, when it was founded, the OECD has worked to open up and help develop the world economy, not only for its member states but also for those nations outside the OECD area. 
We live in an era when the term global economy is redundant. There is one economy, and it is global. And one of the things we need as a nation to keep us competitive is accurate, up-to-date information. We also need a forum in which to work with other nations equally committed to economic openness to achieve the highest sustainable growth and standard of living. That is what the OECD is all about: helping its member nations achieve a better standard of living and higher sustainable growth rate by providing a forum for the exchange of information and policy prescriptions. 
While the OECD has 29 member nations, its reach is global. For example, for a number of years, the OECD had in place the Center for Cooperation with the Economies in Transition (CCET). The CCET was initiated by the U.S. as a result of an amendment I introduced to the SEED Act. My colleagues will recall the SEED Act was designed to help the economies of Central and Eastern Europe build market economies. Well the work of the CCET was so successful, that three nations from that region--Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic--have become members of the OECD. 
Now, the OECD has revised its approach to helping non-member nations to reach beyond the CEE nations. For example, the OECD does a lot work with Russia. It is also closely following the Chinese economy. It has been part of the team of international organizations and governments who have been working on what to do about the economic crisis in Asia. 
The OECD's work is not limited to handling macroeconomic issues. It works on a number of other key economic areas. The Convention to combat Bribery and Corruption is an example of an important OECD initiative. It is also taking the lead on helping governments can best respond to the rapidly changing world of electronic commerce. It is involved with issues relating to regulatory reform, corporate governance, and sustainable development to name a few. 
But perhaps what really distinguishes the OECD from other international organizations is its internal reform efforts. The OECD has undertaken on its own, a significant reform effort. Specifically, it has pledged to cut its overall spending by 10% during the three year period beginning in 1996. It is well on its way toward reaching this. So far that has meant a loss of 180 staff, more than 10% of its total. 
It is my understanding that the subcommittee has decided to use a formula to cut the budgets of international organizations that have administrative costs above 15%. But the data it is using is based on a 1997 State Department study that only goes up to 1995. The OECD has told me that it has brought down administrative costs to about 12.4% of its budget. 
I agree with the committee's goal of trying to get international organizations to make necessary reforms and reductions. The era of big government ought to be over not only at home but with international organizations as well. The OECD is a good story. It has reformed on its own. My fear is that if despite all its efforts to enact cuts, the Congress calls for further arbitrary cuts of the OECD based on data that is not up-to-date, then it will undermine the reformers in the organization who share our goal of getting international organizations to be `leaner and meaner.' 
I, therefore, urge the committee and the Administration to fully fund the OECD at the request level made by the Administration. Let's show that we are willing to reward and encourage organizations like the OECD that make real reforms.

 Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I am proud to join Senator Coats in introducing this important bill. We have become accustomed in the past couple of years to hearing a great deal of positive news about crime trends in this country. Thanks to many factors, including a number of innovative crime-fighting strategies and the return of community policing, most of our cities are experiencing a decrease in violent crime. But the news on the crime front is far from all good. Indeed, as my colleague from Indiana already has noted, there still is far too much violence--and desensitization to violence--among our nation's youth. And, if what demographers tell us about the future is correct, we all should begin now to brace ourselves for what is to come as this group grows in both size and age. 
We can attribute much of the problem of youth crime to the environment--both local and national--in which many of our children are now being reared. For too many children, the things on which previous generations relied to support and teach them simply no longer exist. From the family unit to the local neighborhood to the surrounding community, many children have no where to turn for the support structure necessary to help bring them into adulthood with proper values, commitment to society and, most importantly of all, hope for the future. Without that support, they too often accept a falsely appealing invitation to break their bonds with society and enter a childhood of crime. If we are to combat all of this, if we are to stop youth crime, we must come up with a way to revitalize traditional support structures and to reconnect our nation's youth to our nation's communities. 
The bill Senator Coats and I are introducing today will, we hope, offer one step in that direction. The National Youth Crime Prevention Act would authorize $5 million for the National Center for Youth Enterprise to establish demonstration projects in eight cities, including the city of Hartford in my home state of Connecticut. In these projects, the National Center will build on success it already has had in doing precisely what I just described: working on a grassroots basis within communities to help heal those communities, and with them, their children. 
Mr. President, I am hopeful that with the funding provided by this bill, the National Center's demonstration projects can create model programs that can be replicated across the nation in our war against youth crime. I urge my colleagues to support this bill.

 Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I want to take a few minutes today to talk about the mounting evidence of climate change. No one is saying that there will be an end to the four seasons or that the oceans are about to start boiling. But as we consider the new data, it is becoming increasing clear that we are being warned about the enormous power of humanity to affect our environment. We can either respect our surroundings and work in concert with nature, or we can pollute at our peril. 
Here are some of the facts from data collected by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration: 
June 1998 was the warmest June on record. Temperatures averaged more than 1 degree Fahrenheit above the 1880-1997 long-term mean. Temperatures over land were even more astonishing--averaging nearly one and three quarters of a degree above the long term mean, exceeding the old record by several tenths of a degree Fahrenheit. 
June continued an unprecedented string of record breaking temperatures. Each month this year has set new all-time record global near-surface temperatures. 
The period January-June 1998 was the warmest on record. 
Even though there was a cooling of the Central Pacific Ocean temperatures due to the end of El Nino, global ocean temperatures during June were still at record high levels. 
Given the high degree of persistence of ocean temperature anomalies, scientists tell us it is quite possible that during July we will experience the warmest monthly temperatures ever observed on the planet for the past 600 years. 
What has this trend meant for the United States? Essentially, throughout our country we have been experiencing patterns of weather extremes. 
The South experienced record dry conditions, with the driest April through June period on record for New Mexico, Texas, Louisiana, and Florida. The drought was most severe in Texas and Florida, where it adversely impacted crops, ranges and pastures, and contributed to the burning of nearly one-half million acres of Florida land. 
The drought and heat wave has resulted in a number of new records. For example, Amarillo Texas had 13 days in June where temperatures were over 100 F. With a stable climate, the probability of this recurring is once in 200 years, but with continued increases in greenhouse gases, the probability would change to a 1 in 6 year event. 
On the other hand, there have been unusually wet conditions in the northeast and parts of the midwest during June. For example, rainfalls of 5 to 22 inches were observed across most of the central and northeastern states with totals exceeding 200 percent of normal across the Ohio Valley, New England the upper Mississipi Valley. Parts of the Midwest have experienced above normal rainfall since April, and the rains frequently fell from strong to severe thunderstorms, leading to abnormally frequent episodes of tornadoes, hail, managing winds and flash floods. The National Severe Storm Prediction Center reports that 372 tornadoes were recorded during June in the country, which is nearly 200 more than average. NOAA's National Hydrologic Information Center reports 63 flood-related fatalities for 1998 so far. 
Numerous rainfall records have been broken. For example, more than 17 inches of rain fell during June at Blue Hill Observatory in Massachusetts, breaking all records. 
For the April-June period as a whole, rainfall totals were the highest in the historical record dating back to l895 in Rhode Island and Massachusetts, the third highest in Tennessee, and the fourth highest in Iowa. Rivers in 17 states were near or above flood state as of July 6. 
Mr. President, I believe this new data is additional evidence that we must act to invest in an insurance policy to reduce the threat of global warming. 
President Clinton has proposed to Congress a balanced program to arrest greenhouse gases over 5 years through tax credits for energy-efficient purchases and renewable energy investments, and through new research and development programs targeted towards building, industry, transportation and electricity. It is a well-conceived plan, and I'm disappointed that the Senate bill on EPA appropriations reduces the President's request for EPA's portion of this initiative by $91 million. 
Unfortunately, the efforts of many here in Congress seem to be aimed at preventing the government from taking any action on climate change--even for programs that would be good for our environment and public health regardless of whether you believe that climate change will happen. The report accompanying the House EPA appropriations bill would even prohibit EPA and the Council on Environmental Quality from `conducting educational outreach or informational seminars on policies underlying the Kyoto Protocol' until or unless it is ratified. 
Mr. President, let me take a final moment on the floor today to take some pride in the path that Connecticut's largest employer, United Technologies, is taking in this area. Some of you may have seen the full page ad in July 16's Roll Call by UT entitled, Responding to the Challenge of Climate Change. `Our generation's challenge,' declares the ad `is addressing global climate change while sustaining a growing economy--a challenge that demands a serious response from government, as well as industry and the public.' United Technologies has taken a major step forward to reduce emissions. By 2007, the company commits to cutting its energy and water consumption per dollar sales by 25 percent below 1997 levels, with approximately the same reduction in its emissions that cause climate change. I congratulate United Technologies and its president George David for this great leap forward and urge us all to accept the challenge the company has put forth.

Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Chair. 
Mr. President, I am proud to stand and join my colleagues from Arizona and Washington in voicing concerns about the spread of pornography on the Internet and the general direction in which the information superhighway is moving. 
Like my colleagues, I am very troubled by the story that USA Today carried this morning about a particular web site--www.ourfirsttime.com--that is promising to broadcast a video feed of two 18-year-old high school graduates having sexual intercourse for the first time as it happens next month. 
As Senator McCain indicated, it may be that this site is a hoax, but it makes a statement about the Internet and the values in cyberspace which is all too real, because it shows that there are practically no stop signs on the information superhighway. 
The important point here is that two teenagers could quite easily decide to do this and invite every wired American child effectively to a live sex show, regardless of their age, which tells us that there are no recognizable boundaries in cyberspace, no common standards of decency or taste, or any shared sense of accountability. Anyone can do just about anything, and they often do. 
This is no revelation to experienced `netizens' who are well aware of the wide array of sites concerning bomb-making, bestiality, and many other expressions of antisocial behavior and deviancy. They know that the net, while offering incredible riches of information, education, and communication, has also managed to catch just about every form of depravity and antisocial behavior and put it on display for all the world and our children to see. 
Yet, for many nonwired Americans, the extremes of online perversity may be news, and these citizens, particularly the parents, have every right to be fearful about what is lurking around the net's next corner. 
What they will find, I am afraid, is not just more and more pornography for kids to latch on to, but less and less moral certainty, fewer bright lines of right and wrong, the kind that are critical to living in a free, decent, civil society. One of those bright lines we never used to question was our responsibility as adults to protect our children from harm, both physical and moral, which meant shielding them from violence and carefully setting sexual boundaries for them as they grow. 
In recent years, our commitment to this common value seems to have weakened, giving rise to a popular culture that is replete with gunplay and foreplay, with violence and public displays and comments on all forms of sexual behavior, and it teaches children the worst kind of lessons about what is acceptable. Today, unfortunately, this extraordinary development in our lives, the Internet, which has so enriched our lives in so many ways, has also become the highest tech distillation of this anything-goes mentality. 
Senator McCain and Senator Murray have been forceful advocates for drawing basic lines of online decency and setting basic standards of online behavior. I applaud their leadership on this front. In particular, I appreciate their efforts to promote responsible use of the Internet at schools and libraries. I hope we have a chance to consider their legislation on the floor soon. 
Mr. President, in the best of all worlds, which is to say what we hope this online world might be, the responsibility for drawing lines and setting standards really should fall to the leaders of the Internet community. 
I have said over and over again in my comments about television and video games and records, for instance, that I am extremely reluctant to resort to governmental restrictions on speech or any forms of expression and much prefer self-regulation. Also, given the sophistication of the net's underlying technology, I doubt that a legally mandated solution to the pornography problem will be as effective as we would want it to be in reaching our common goal of protecting children. 
It was for these reasons that I voted against the Communications Decency Act, and it was for those reasons that I recently began working with Representative Rick White of Washington State to push the Internet community to get moving on this issue. Nine days ago, we sent a letter to the major participants in last December's Online Summit expressing our concern about the industry's lack of action and calling on them to collaborate on a comprehensive plan to help parents keep their kids safe online. We made it clear that we did not want to pursue legislation but that we, along with a host of other Members of Congress from both parties, would have no choice but to vote for Government standards if the industry did not respond with an effective solution. 
So, in sum, Mr. President, we are still waiting for a response to our letter. My hope is that the news about the `our first time,' and the forcefulness of the statements we are making today, will help to focus the Internet community's attention on the seriousness of this problem and prod them to produce some tangible results. In the meantime, I hope our comments will raise the awareness of America's parents about the threat that the Internet can pose to children and encourage them to pay closer attention to their children's online activities. 
I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.

Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Chair. 
I rise to join with my colleagues from Arizona and Kentucky, who have just spoken, with a certain sense of reluctance about opposing the amendment of the Senator from Indiana because of the respect I have for him, because of the thoughtful way in which he goes about matters generally and particularly matters of foreign policy. But to echo what has just been said, this is a very complicated and controversial subject, an important exercise of one of the major options that the United States has in carrying out its foreign policy. 
The bipartisan Senate leadership has created a task force that has been referred to. As has been said, we only had an opportunity to hold our first meeting yesterday. So I think for us to act on this quite comprehensive piece of legislation, which will dramatically alter the landscape in which the United States, Congress, can impose economic sanctions, is a rush to judgment before we have had a chance to hear from all sides, as the task force will do--a public hearing is going to occur--to reason together and then to come up with a proposal. 
As the Senator from Kentucky said, the end proposal may contain major parts of the amendment offered by the Senator from Indiana. But I think we would do much better and serve our national interest better if we worked this out over a period of time. There is no emergency now that I can think of, that I know of, that requires us to adopt this wholesale change in what has been a fundamental part of our foreign policy for a long time now, deriving, incidentally, from a constitutional premise of the ability, Congress' ability, to regulate commerce with other nations of the world. 
So I think this is premature, though probably thoughtful. But I say `probably' because this is a detailed amendment which I, frankly, have not been able to absorb in the time it has been in the Chamber, to make a reasoned judgment, even if there was not a task force that had been appointed on this very subject. 
I hear the Senator from Indiana; his intention is for its effect to be prospective, not to affect any sanctions that are in law now, and yet there are sections of this that begin `notwithstanding any other provision of law' and impose procedural requirements that make me wonder whether they would affect, for instance, the President's ability to impose sanctions in an emergency situation which, if we adopted this amendment, he might be limited from doing. 
So there are questions. And I think we should step back, acknowledge that there is a chorus that has risen rather rapidly in the last period of months questioning the extent to which we have applied sanctions, the manner in which we have done it, and listen to that chorus but not rush to act in response to it before we have had a chance, each of us, to deliberate and do what is right. 
Now, I want to offer one other set of thoughts here, Mr. President. Why is this so important? Well, let's all begin with the fact that most of us acknowledge, as the Senator from Kentucky said, we have not, most of us, been consistent in our votes on these matters. It is hard to be consistent in our votes on matters of sanctions, that they have been used too much. I think most of us in this Chamber would say that. That is why the leadership created the bipartisan task force, to begin to set some guidelines. But in all the criticism that we are heaping on ourselves, I think it is important not to lose sight of the value of sanctions. They are, roughly speaking, one of three options that a government has to protect its strategic interests and uphold its ideals--diplomatic, economic, and military. 
If I may say so--and I know people sometimes say that we are foolish to do this, that it is self-defeating--we have to consider the impact some of the sanctions have had not just on farm States. I can tell you, some of the sanctions regimes have had an effect on manufacturing, high tech and industrial, from my State. And I am not reaching judgment on the net effect. 
Let's just say a word for the fact that there is a part of our national character that, as Americans, is prepared to say we care so much about what is happening in another country, about the way that country is suppressing its people, or the threat that that country represents to our security because they are threatening their neighbors, who are our allies, or they are building missiles, that we are prepared, if our allies will not go along with us, to impose economic sanctions on them to affect their behavior. In an age when a lot of people question, well, all we care about is materialism, I am speaking respectfully of the impact of sanctions on people. This is in its way an expression of American idealism and principle and values. And while we may have overused it, we should not diminish its utility and its substance. 
Finally, Mr. President, there is a very important question to ask: Have they worked? I think the record is mixed, but that is something I would like to have our task force study and, at least as one Member, learn more about. I don't know enough about it. 
I know most people cite South Africa as a case where sanctions worked. Those were multilateral. More recently, sanctions we imposed on Colombia did work to alter the fundamental policy of the Government on an issue that matters to us. We have sanctions against Iraq and Libya. Well, I note that the heads of those regimes worked mightily in international diplomatic circles to get the sanctions off, so they must be having an effect on them. The same is true about the opposition of the Chinese to sanctions that we consider, and the Russians with regard to supplying components of missile parts to Iran. 
I know that Senator Lugar is not speaking against sanctions generally, and I appreciate that, and I share that view with him. We share that view because we understand, I hope all of us, that sanctions have value and have had effect. We are using them too much, but I think it requires more thought than we have had the opportunity to give before we vote on this amendment to change the ground rules so dramatically. So I intend to vote against the amendment. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I am privileged to join today with my senior colleague from Connecticut, Senator Dodd, to offer an amendment to the fiscal year 1999 agriculture spending bill to correct an oversight which threatens the ability of the Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station to continue its important research activities. 
The Station has a long and proud history. It happens to be the first state agricultural experiment station in the country, dating from 1875, and also happens to be the only state agricultural experiment station not affiliated with a university. Consequently, it is not eligible to apply for competitive grant funds from the Fund for Rural America or from the Initiative for Future Agriculture and Food Systems. The amendment we offer today makes a minor technical correction to allow the Station to compete for these grants just like every other experiment station across the country. We're not asking for any special consideration here. All we are asking for is an opportunity to compete. 
The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station conducts research on plant pathology, horticulture, biochemistry, genetics, as well as many other science-based research projects. It also researches important public health issues, as well, such as Lyme Disease, which is a particular problem in our region, and now, nationwide. This important research should continue, and that is why we have brought this issue to the attention of the Senate today. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.

Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise to express my strong opposition to S. 2271. 
On the face of this bill, it sounds like the proponents are seeking to make some `procedural' changes in federal court jurisdiction that do not go as far as last Congress' unsuccessful attempts to change the standards for granting compensation under the Fifth Amendment. 
But no one should be mistaken. This bill would dramatically change the standards--known as abstention and ripeness--which guide the resolution of claims for `just compensation' against local communities in local zoning disputes. The impact of these so-called procedural changes would be very significant, making it far easier to seriously undermine local land-use decisions. As a New York Times editorial stated with respect to the related House bill: `(The bill) is a dangerous piece of work that would threaten local zoning laws, reshape time-honored principles of federalism and make Federal judges the arbiters of land-use decisions everywhere. It would be a dream come true for developers but a nightmare for rational community planning.' I believe that conclusion would apply with equal force to the bill before us. 
That is why the bill is opposed by the National Governors Association, the League of Cities, the United States Conference of Mayors, the National Association of Counties, the Judicial Conference of the United States, 40 Attorneys General, major religious groups, the National Trust for Historic Preservation and a broad array of environmental and public interest groups. 
For my State, this type of proposal is particularly contrary to what our citizens are seeking. There is no bigger issue right now in the State than the desire to preserve open space from development. Our Governor, John Rowland, has initiated a major program to preserve open space and the State Legislature has strongly supported these efforts. Connecticut is not unique: all over the country, states and localities are making preservation of open space a top priority. 
This bill would seriously undermine these efforts by greatly expanding the volume of land-use litigation against local communities. Equally important, the heightened threat of litigation would significantly increase the leverage of developers over local communities in negotiations over land use issues. The existing authority of local governments to resolve local land use issues in their community would be undermined, and the ability of the public to participate in land-use decisions affecting their communities would be greatly diminished. In short, the end result of this legislation would be to undercut the ability of our nation's localities to protect zoning and land use regulations which average homeowners depend on to protect their investments. 
In reviewing the Committee and Minority views on the bill considered by the Committee, I was particularly struck by a comment by Senator DeWine during the markup. He stated: `The bill would in effect, leave local land use planners with two bad options--acquiesce to developers by making lenient decisions, or do whatever they think necessary to protect the local community and then face multiple suits in Federal court without having much negotiating ability with property owners.' Senator DeWine is right and with respect to the bill before us, too. 
What is striking about this bill is the direct attack it makes on the ability of local and state governments to determine what is best for their communities, despite the fact that there is no evidence that local governments are incompetent or routinely deal in bad faith with developers. Nor is there any record to support the proposition that state courts cannot deal fairly with local land use zoning disputes. 
Mr. President, I cannot see any reason why this Senate should pass legislation that is a wholesale attack on the ability of our localities and states to protect the values and fabric of the communities in which we live. I urge my colleagues to vote against the cloture motion.

Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, the distinguished leader's reference to the Constitution provides a transition for me today, and I appreciate it. 
Mr. President, 222 years and 6 days ago, our Founding Fathers issued what we today regard as America's birth certificate: the Declaration of Independence. We know well the significance of this date which we celebrated, once again, last weekend all across the land and the subsequent events that comprise the remarkable and unique story of our freedom. But sometimes, it seems to me, we have lost sight of the substance of the document itself, and its continued relevance to our polity. So today I would like to revisit this great statement of our American ideals to see what guidance it gives us about our current condition. 
Reread Jefferson's master work and you will see that it was not just the declaration of our independence, but also a declaration of our interdependence, a defining statement of the common conditions and values, the shared principles and purposes that would unite a diverse population of English and European pilgrims into a nation. 
The original Americans did not all come from the same land, 
but they all did agree that there are fundamental truths that are self-evident. 
They did not all hold the same religious tenets, but they did all hold an unerring faith that those inalienable rights that Jefferson enumerated in the declaration were endowed not by some benign king nor by the grace of a new government, but by their Creator. 
I was moved to reflect, Mr. President, upon the declaration's meaning as our latest national birth date passed last Saturday by the recent comments of two prominent contemporary political activists about the state of our values in America in 1998, comments which, when taken together, I fear show how we have lost some of the unity of our founders' national vision. 
The first came from Dr. James Dobson, the head of Focus on the Family, who for sometime now has been ringing a national alarm bell about the Nation's declining morality. It was just a few weeks ago that Dr. Dobson caused a stir by proclaiming to the national press that we are in the midst of a civil war over America's future, pitting the moral haves against the moral have-nots. 
Not long after, Jane Fonda gave a speech on teen pregnancy that actually echoed Dr. Dobson's martial proclamation, but from a very different perspective. Ms. Fonda attacked the views espoused by Dr. Dobson and others on abortion and sex education, accusing them of ignoring children that `are not white, middle-class Christians' and warned her audience that our society is in the throes of a `holy war,' pitting the forces of tolerance against the forces of intolerance. 
It would be easy to dismiss this apocalyptic talk, this talk that seems, in some words, certainly to be intemperate, as just another bout of the hyperbole that dominates so much of our political discourse these days if it were not for the accumulation of evidence suggesting that Dr. Dobson and Ms Fonda are each in their own ways on to something. Maybe, as the stark contrast and conflict of their views and the way in which they express them suggest, the values that have long held us together are coming unglued. Maybe we are on the verge of abandoning the declaration's premise of interdependence and sliding toward either individual isolation or open conflict. 
There is certainly a slew of public opinion polls showing that most Americans are gravely concerned about the condition of our values. There was a Gallup-USA Today survey released in March found that 49 percent of Americans believe that we are in the midst of a moral crisis. 
And another 41 percent said they believe we have major moral problems. What is driving these numbers, the polls suggest, is a swelling sense that our moral safety net, the interlaced norms of behavior we depend on to maintain a civil society, has become badly frayed, and that this fraying has contributed to some of our most pressing social ills, from the recent outbreak of children slaughtering children, to the ongoing epidemic of children giving birth to children, to the general coarsening of conversation, communication in our shared public places. 
Mr. President, then consider, if you will, the vociferous complaints of millions of American parents--I certainly hear them in Connecticut--who feel as if they are locked in a competition with the immensely powerful, popular culture to raise their own children, a culture which more and more rejects, rather than reflects, the fundamental values we Americans have abided by for generations that have served us so well, a culture that glorifies murder, mayhem and drug abuse, promotes promiscuity and the latest perversion of the moment, denigrates authority with a numbing regularity, and wallowing in titillation and sensationalism and, it seems so often, all things scandalous. 
Or closer to home, here in Congress, consider what our investigation of the 1996 campaign finance scandal revealed. We live in a political system where the clear intention of laws governing campaigns are regularly violated, where we have defined political deviancy down so far that it seems the only relevant standard left is what is technically legal--which is another way of saying, `What can we get away with in order to raise vast sums of money to run more television ads, to win more elections?'--and where hustlers cynically compare gaining access to the White House to dropping tokens into a subway turnstile. 
Or consider the hostile tone of the debates we often hear in this Congress about visceral, values-based issues, particularly such as abortion or homosexuality or school prayer. The rancor of these discussions, which is eagerly amplified by the news media, only reinforces the impression that values are something that divides us as Americans today rather than defining us. 
So there is ample evidence, I think, to suggest that something is deeply wrong with America's moral health today. Nor is it a stretch to conclude that Dr. Dobson and Ms. Fonda, together with the legions of other culture warriors who have seconded their respective convictions, raised some legitimate and consequential questions about what it is that ails us in our capacity to remedy it. 
Among them are, What has happened to the founding principles that undergirded the Declaration and, for that matter, the Constitution and have sustained us for generations? Have we, in some sense, taken tolerance too far? Is our commitment to a common moral code on a set of fixed points of right and wrong self-evident truths that we declared in the Declaration disintegrating? And if it is, can a house so divided against its own values stand strong for long? 
Mr. President, in my remarks today I will try to offer some answers that may add to our understanding of the controversial and complicated values debate, with the hope I may help to, in some small way, move it beyond the warped groove we seem to be stuck in these days. I do so convinced that America's moral Cassandras are on to something, that our Nation is in the grip of a crisis of values, that there really is a conflict at our 
core, and that the recent spate of school shootings and murders are a warning sign of even greater trouble ahead. 
But I also do so convinced that we are misdiagnosing this conflict by framing it as a civil war, and that those who do, in fact, make it harder to overcome the very divisions that they bemoan and we, as a people, must repair if we are to fix what is, indeed, broken in our society. 
Let me first try to say a bit more about what I mean by common values, because I know from experience that these words carry heavy baggage with them today and, as such, are often interpreted differently by different people which is, in itself, a symptom of the larger problem we face. 
The best reference point I can think of is the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution, and the Bill of Rights, which are the great founding expressions of American values. 
What are those core principles? Equal opportunity, freedom of religion and expression, particularly individual autonomy, self-rule, personal and civic responsibility, tolerance, and a respect for the basic dignity and underlying pervasive respect for the basic dignity of human life. All of these are derived, I believe, and can be seen from the documents--the Declaration particularly--all of these are derived from our faith in God, in our belief in the existence of moral truth and a higher law, and all of which, I suggest, are essential to living and sustaining a free and democratic society. 
These Founding Fathers, we know, had their roots in the Judeo-Christian ethic, the Declaration's drafters, but the values are not exclusive to any one religion. In fact, over the years, they evolved into an American civic religion--principled, purposeful, moral, public, and not least of all inclusive--an American civics religion that cemented our common bonds as Americans for generations and made real the ideal of e pluribus unum--`one out of many.' 
But there is a profound tension that I think we have to acknowledge in these founding values between rights and freedoms, which we, as individuals, have been endowed, as the document says, by our Creator on the one hand, and in the mutual responsibilities and common obligations we must accept to form a government capable of securing those freedoms on the other hand--in other words, the coinciding claims of independence and interdependence that Jefferson articulated so brilliantly in the Declaration. 
And it is in these tensions, I think, that we find the antecedents of the conflict that today engages Dr. Dobson, Ms. Fonda and so many others. It is, at its heart, not a conflict, I think, between warring camps of American citizens so much as a clash of competing fundamental American values--independence versus interdependence, the belief in moral truth versus the value of communal tolerance. It seems to me that we are not experiencing a wholesale repudiation of the basic common values I have described, but rather a shift in our national moral equilibrium in which tolerance has emerged as the more popular principle of the day. 
A great challenge we face in our time, given this shift, is how to sustain tolerance without inviting immorality and how to uphold moral truth without becoming intolerant. This tension is illuminated by the research that Boston University sociologist Alan Wolfe did for his recent book `One Nation After All,' which was based on interviews with 200 middle-class Americans from eight different communities across the country. 
Wolfe set out to test the conventional wisdom reflected, particularly in Dr. Dobson's comments that `a deep divide existed between upholders of traditional cultural and moral values and those attracted to more modern themes of personal or group identity,' end of quote from Alan Wolfe. What he found, to the surprise of many, is a high degree of agreement across ideological, theological, racial and ethnic lines on a core set of common values, on the basic questions of right and wrong that still bridge our many differences as Americans. 
But Wolfe also found a correspondingly high degree of reluctance to translate those privately held values into public expressions that hold others accountable to those shared standards. 
The common refrain Wolfe heard was that people did not want to appear intolerant and did not feel comfortable imposing their morality on their neighbors. 
Of course, in some ways this rise in tolerance has made us a much better country, much truer to our founding ideals of equality and opportunity. We have opened a world of new, more equal opportunities for women; for instance, working to eradicate many confining and misguided biases. We have made great progress over the last generation in fighting bigotry and discrimination against African-Americans, making more real for them after a terrible national history of inequality and persecution, the equality of opportunity the Declaration and Constitution proposed for all Americans. 
The same is happening with regard to our fellow Americans who are of Hispanic and Asian descent, or today who follow the faith of Islam, a group that is growing in number in our country. And we have begun to stamp out the prejudice long harbored against homosexuals and accept them as fellow citizens deserving of the same basic rights and respect as all other Americans. 
But the triumph of tolerance in our values in recent decades has also had a less constructive effect. The pendulum has swung so far and has become so wary of the label `intolerant' that I think we are increasingly unwilling, and in some cases incapable, of making moral judgments. This is evident in the evolution of public attitudes about the family, where we have gone from earlier times stigmatizing adultery, divorce, and particularly out-of-wedlock childbirth, to normalizing these behaviors, with little apparent consideration given to the damage these choices can do, particularly to children individually or to our society collectively. 
It is also evident in too many of our schools, where teachers and curricula avoid mentioning the word `values' or won't dare to instruct children in the meaning of right and wrong for fear that is too controversial or may offend some. 
It is particularly evident, I fear, in the influential entertainment media, where executives at multibillion-dollar conglomerates too often refuse to draw any lines that they will not cross to raise their ratings and revenues. These men and women produce a market to our children--records that find fun in cop killing, gang rape; even at the extreme, pedophilia; video games that reward young players for mowing down innocent people with weapons; homicidal hotrods and television talk shows that degrade the human spirit and delight in the exploitation of human misery and perversity. 
If criticized, the people who run the entertainment business often wave the first amendment around as if it were a constitutional hall pass that excuses their conduct, loathe to admit that the pollution they are dumping into the public square has much less to do with free speech than it has to do with higher profits. 
The media moguls are surely not the only business leaders who have suspended judgment and let the values of the market, or the inherent lack thereof, rule practically unfettered. Much as Alan Wolfe's research suggests, more and more business leaders seem to be checking their privately held values, which are strong and deep, at the office door and, by extension, at least when they are functioning in their businesses, their sense of social responsibility. As a result, it too often seems as if the bottom line is the only line and that raising consumption is 
a far more important priority than raising healthy children. 
The purest distillation of this ethos, I think, can be found in the new world of the Internet. Our shared enthusiasm for this exciting and immensely valuable new medium has, unfortunately, been tempered by the almost complete absence of boundaries or rules to guide online conduct. This is not just true of the criminals and the miscreants, the pornographers, pedophiles, and scam artists who, sadly, are taking advantage of the net's anonymity to do wrong, but also a distressing number of businesses that should know better. A recent report by the Federal Trade Commission on cyberspace privacy showed that many nationally recognized companies are using exploitive and manipulative marketing practices online to target web-surfing grade schoolers as potential customers. Specifically, an FTC survey of 212 sites aimed at kids found that 89 percent collect personally identifiable information and fewer than 10 percent provide any form of parental control over what information can be solicited. 
Now, one could argue that it is not fair to judge these companies by their conduct in cyberspace since it is such a new medium. But one could also argue, as I would, that the best way to gauge someone's ethics is to judge their conduct when no one is looking. Well, is anyone looking today in America? The founders of our country, the people who drafted the Declaration of Independence and signed it, believed that God was always looking--which is why they showed such deference to what they described as the Supreme Judge of the world in the Declaration of Independence and why they made religious freedom the first freedom. They knew that in this Republic that they were creating, where the power of the state was to be limited, where the state would not be all powerful, that faith in God, in a higher law, would be a necessary and powerfully constructive source of good behavior among the citizenry. 
Surveys done today consistently show that more than 90 percent of the American people say they believe in God. I can't think of another question we could ask on a poll in this country that would get that high a response. We exhibit levels of religiosity that are far greater than any country in the world. Yet over the last generation or two we have grown increasingly reluctant to allow that faith to be expressed in public, so much so that it seems at times we have banished religious values and religious institutions from our public policy deliberations and construct a discomfort zone for even discussing our faith in public settings, ironically making religion one of the few remaining socially acceptable targets of intolerance. 
If you look at the talk shows on television and see subjects that are being discussed there which go way over the line, think of how little we see similar discussions of matters of faith. In driving religion from the public square, we manage to slowly and significantly, I fear, dislodge our morality from its religious foundations and thereby have lost what I described a few moments ago as our unifying national civic religion. 
In some ways, the Ten Commandments became just another `do and don't' list that people feel free to argue with, negotiate, or ignore outright. Without the connection to a higher law, we have made it more and more difficult for people to answer the question of why it is wrong to steal, cheat, or lie, or settle conflicts with violence, or be unfaithful to one's spouse, or to be exploitive with children. We have often deprived our public life of what I believe is the best source of better behavior that the human race has, which is faith in God and a sense of personal accountability and responsibility that should go with it. 
The net result of the intertwined trends that I have just described--the triumph of tolerance, the lionization of the market, the breakdown in authority, and the loss of public accountability that comes from faith--is that we have succeeded in creating a values vacuum in American life today. In this vacuum, where moral certainty fears to tread, there are fewer and fewer bright lines and more and more blurs of gray. The difficult balance of truth and tolerance, which for most of our country has sustained us, has been lost. 
And we are increasingly inclined to ask, `whose values?' when a question of morality is raised. 
How much does this really matter? Well, according to Harvard's Michael Sandel, the dissolution of our public morality, coupled with the lost sense of common purposes, has effectively crippled our Government's ability to resolve our most complicated issues in formulating public policy. Without a common vocabulary of values and basic moral assumptions that should form our policies and our laws, Sandel suggests that our most important public debates are doomed from the start because we lack even a shared framework for reaching agreement. 
Professor Sandel goes further, arguing in his recent book `Democracy's Discontent' that the breakdown in our common moral code has put the entire American experiment in self-government in jeopardy. Sandel says that in moving toward a value-neutral polity, we have abandoned what our colleague, Pat Moynihan, has so aptly called the `central task' of any society--to inculcate values and develop virtue in its citizens, its children. By turning our backs on this mission, we have depleted the public capital necessary for a democratic government to function effectively. The consequences? A public philosophy that Professor Sandel says, `cannot secure the liberty it promises because it cannot sustain the kind of political community and civic engagement that liberty requires.' 
This cause for concern was reaffirmed by an important new report released last month by the National Commission on Civic Renewal, chaired by our former colleague, Sam Nunn, and by former Education Secretary Bill Bennett, which found that we are increasingly becoming `a Nation of spectators,' passively disengaged from the duties and work of self-government. The commission examined 22 different trend lines, such as voter turnout, newspaper readership, and survey measurements of public trust, and determined that our civic condition has declined precipitously over the last generation. 
Now, these indices of our current moral and civic decline become even more rattling when we consider what is filling the values vacuum today and what that means for our future. As our traditional values transmitters have shrunk from the task, the omnipresent, powerful popular culture has stepped in to assume that vitally important role. That means that the people setting the norms of behavior in this country and the standards of right and wrong more and more are the television producers and syndicators, the movie moguls, the fashion advertisers, the record manufacturers, the software designers, and a host of other players within the electronic media-cultural complex that collectively exert a powerful hold on our consciousness. 
The work these people and many others are doing too often sends the worst kinds of messages. They teach our kids that the proper way to resolve a disagreement is with a fist to the face or a bullet to the brain, that sex is a form of recreational activity without consequences, and that parents exist either to be mocked or ignored. These messages are breeding more of the same values vacuum that created them in the first place, communicating to our children that standards are fungible and matters of right and wrong are negotiable at best, irrelevant at worst. 
Most entertainment industry leaders deny that they exert this kind of influence, but the evidence to the contrary is accumulating in such abundance that the media conglomerates, I think, are on the verge--dangerous verge--of becoming the 
moral equals of the tobacco industry. Indeed, much like the link between cancer and cigarettes, the decidedly negative effects of prolonged exposure to violence on television has been proven conclusively by an overwhelming body of social science research, a conclusion embraced by the American people, yet continually disputed in public by producers of violent programming. 
There is also a recent, growing body of research to show a correlation between heavy viewing of sexual content and kids initiating sexual activity before they otherwise would have. A survey done by Time magazine last month showed that 29 percent of teenagers said they learned about sex mainly from television, second only to their friends as a source of knowledge, indicating that the small screen has become a big sex educator. Also, many child development experts have voiced concerns that the omnipresence of graphic sexual displays throughout the media and in advertising is helping to sexualize our children at an unhealthily early age. It was because of these reports that I sponsored legislation in the fiscal 1998 Labor-HHS appropriations bill directing the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development to initiate a broad-based research initiative on the media's influence on children's sexual behavior. That is now underway. Hopefully, it will provide us a clearer understanding of the relationship. 
What the experts tell us has recently been corroborated by an abundance of real-life experiences. Earlier this year, in Norfolk, VA, for instance, educators within the local public schools observed that a disturbing number of children who watched Jerry Springer's fight-filled talk show were often choosing to settle their disputes, as they explained, `like they do it on the Springer Show,' with punches and kicks. One principal in Norfolk was so concerned that she sent home a letter with each student pleading with parents not to let them watch Springer anymore. 
What can we make of the horrific bullets that children are firing with frightening frequency these days in the cafeterias, hallways, classrooms, and courtyards of America's schools? I am certainly not here to claim that the media is solely to blame for this spate of student gunfire. To do so would be unfair and would ignore the factual complexity of each case. Yet, it would be a far greater folly, I think, to ignore the pattern emerging that indicates that there is a connection between these violent acts and the culture of violence enveloping our children. 
According to a recent report in the New York Times, which reviewed the most well-publicized cases of student violence over the last 9 months, as well as a few earlier incidents, we can conclude that each of the attackers `seemed to be obsessed with the violent pop culture.' We know from various press reports that the boys in Springfield, OR; Pearl, MS, and Edinboro, PA, listened regularly to the nihilistic, hateful lyrics of shock-rocker Marilyn Manson. We know from the testimony of a teacher from Westside Middle School in Jonesboro, AR, that the older of the two shooters there was a devotee of vicious gangsta rap music, and that a favorite song of his by the group Bone-Thugs-n-Harmony plays out an open-field massacre of revenge quite similar to the plan the 13-year-old and the 11-year-old accomplice executed in March. And we know in some detail of the fascination a 14-year-old in Moses Lake, WA, who mowed down three students in his algebra class 2 years ago, had with Oliver Stone's ghoulish movie, `Natural Born Killers,' because two friends of his told authorities that the boy had confided to them that it would be `pretty cool' and `fun' to go on a killing spree like the movie's lead characters. 
To truly understand this connection, though, we need to know more. I am the first to say that, though I am critical of the entertainment media. Senator Brownback and I took one step in that direction earlier this week when we convened a discussion forum on Tuesday with several leading experts, including writers, social scientists, a district attorney, and a clergyman to explore in greater detail the roots of this deeply disturbing trend of student violence. The discussion we had produced a remarkably strong consensus that, in fact, the culture is a major contributing factor, and the dissolution of the family is clearly another factor. 
But culture, everyone tells us, is a contributing factor. That is why I am considering legislation that would ask the Justice Department to conduct a far-reaching study to examine the relationship between media violence and juvenile crime. It is an issue that has already been deeply politicized and, in some respects, oversimplified, and before it gets any more so, we need to see what the science can objectively tell us. 
But at the same time, I don't think we have to wait to conclude that something is deeply wrong in our society when our children are slaughtering each other, and that the enormously attractive and stimulating images of murder and mayhem so rampant throughout the electronic media are playing some role in this American nightmare. 
We can and also should talk about easy access to guns too many kids enjoy, which is evidenced by a recent study showing that nearly one million kids brought a firearm to school at least once this past school year, and nearly half of them did so at least six times. And we can and should talk about the need for greater parental involvement and faster intervention by counselors and other school personnel when kids show signs they are homicidal or suicidal. 
But I think we have to also talk honestly about the reality that boys in many parts of the country for a long time have had easy access to guns, that some have always been spurned by girls, and some have always had emotional problems, some have had reason to be angry with teachers or fellow students. Yet, to my knowledge, we have never before in our history seen a similar series of cases where some of these young men--boys really--work out their problems by grabbing guns and massacring their teachers and classmates. So I think we have to ask, Where do they get such an idea? Maybe it is from the contemporary culture. 
Before this lunacy goes any further, we must ask the entertainment industry, which, notwithstanding my criticisms, really has done so much good by enlightening our minds and touching our hearts, but also confront the harm it can do, the effect the entertainment industry can have of pushing some troubled children, particularly, over the edge, that they hear our pleas to stop raining down so much death and messages of death on our children. 
Thankfully, we are beginning to hear cause for hope from the corridors of American cultural power, as more and more media executives have been willing to break the silence associated with the values vacuum. Both ABC President Bob Iger and former NBC Chairman Grant Tinker have given speeches at major television conventions this year decrying the Springerization of the airwaves as `an embarrassment to our business,' in Iger's words, and challenged broadcasters to `stand for something,' in Tinker's words. 
And Disney Chairman Michael Eisner made a forceful statement to the American Society of Newspaper Editors this spring in which he candidly criticized those in the industry who `hide behind the skirts of the Constitution' to justify marketing of `vile programs' like Springer. These are permissible under the First Amendment,' he said, `but they are not desirable if we aspire to call ourselves civilized.' He then called on his peers to make the kind of moral judgments that they and too many of us have been reluctant to consider. `Edit we must,' he said, `not to stife conflict or conviction, but to eliminate debasement.' 
Also encouraging is what is happening outside the cultural epicenters of New York and Hollywood. In recent months, a political consensus has begun to take shape about the dire state of our moral and civic condition, bringing together disparate voices on the left and the right to cry out for renewing fundamental values in our public life. 
This consensus is expressed eloquently in an important new report, `A Call to Civil Society: Why Democracy Needs Moral Truth,' which was issued by a diverse collection of leading academics, theologians, social activists, civic leaders and politicians, from Harvard's Cornel West to UCLA's James Q. Wilson. This report, which Senator Coats and I were privileged to play a role in shaping, is particularly significant because it reassets the central premises of the Declaration's claim of interdependence, that there are moral truths that we as a people must uphold for our experiment in self-rule to work. 
This emerging consensus was also evident at the National Fatherhood Summit that was held here in Washington last month. This convocation was called to highlight the crisis of father absence we are experiencing in this country, in which the number of children living without a father of any kind that has quadrupled over the last two generations, and to mobilize a response. The day-long affair was thoroughly bipartisan, with the leaders of both houses of Congress serving as honorary co-hosts and Vice President Gore delivering the key-note address, and it produced unanimity about the critical importance of fathers in the raising of children and the need to strengthen the two-parent family. 
For the left and the right to reach agreement on this front represents remarkable prograss. A few years ago it was not just politically incorrect but politically dangerous to talk about the primacy of the two-parent family, as Dan Quayle learned, and to emphasize the critical role fathers play in the lives of their children. To do so was considered a knock against single mothers and perhaps all women. But the Fatherhood Summit and the Call to Civil Society suggest that we have turned an important corner in the politics of the family, and reflect a common understanding that to iterate the value of involved fathers is not to denigrate the value of single mothers who are often some of the greatest heroes in our society today. 
Perhaps the most telling indicator of how far we have come is the recent statement that Murphy Brown herself made about the subject. Candice Bergen, the actress who played the sharp-tongued television character, recently declared that Dan Quayle `was right' to talk about the troubling marginalization of fathers in his infamous speech in 1992--although she still holds firm that the former Vice President was wrong in his specific criticism of Murphy Brown's choice to have a child on her own. `It was a completely logical speech,' Bergen said in a newspaper interview. `Fathers are not indispensible. They are vital to a family.' 
Which raises an obvious question: If Dan Quayle and Murphy Brown can find common moral ground now, why then do we continue to hear the steady beat of the culture war drums echoing throughout the political arena? 
No one can deny here, nor do I think there is any question that these differences do reflect the broader philosophical schism dividing parts of our society, a moral fault line that generally separates--and here is how I would describe that fault line--it generally separates the champions of tolerance like Jane Fonda from the defenders of traditional values like James Dobson. 
But I suspect the values vacuum that overrides all has been represented to both exaggerate and exacerbate these divisions, making the extent of our moral disagreements appear far greater than Professor Alan Wolfe's research, and several other supporting polls, actually show them to be. It seems that the less we express our morality publicly, the more trouble we have finding a common vocabulary of values, which makes it even more difficult for us to discuss civilly and constructively those issues that divide us, or to identify those principles that unite us. This communications breakdown deepens the contempt and suspicion that each side already feels for the other. 
The news media, I am afraid to say, which itself has been infected by that anything-goes mentality--not always, but often infected by the anything-goes mentality pervading the entertainment culture--seems too often to fan the flames of controversy. The result is not so much an honest, engaged debate about values, but a culture war echo chamber that only heightens the average citizen's distorted sense that the country is locked in a mortal moral struggle. 
The conflict over homosexuality's place, the place of homosexuals in our society, I think, offers a contemporary example of this tension that is very real in our lives and in our discussions and debates. Let's start with the reality that many Americans continue to believe that homosexuality is immoral and not just because the Bible tells them so. In fact, Professor Wolfe's research showed that this is one of the few areas where Americans of all religious inclinations feel so strongly that they are willing to risk the tag of intolerance to express or hold to their points of view, although most of the people he interviewed tempered their disapproval by making clear that they did not support discrimination against gay men and lesbians. It is unfair, when you think about Professor Wolfe's research, then, for anyone to automatically conclude that people who express moral reservations or even disdain about homosexuality are bigots, or to publicly attack them as hateful. These are sincerely held morally based views. 
Yet the suspicions and concerns of the gay community are understandable when one considers the Senate's treatment of James Hormel's nomination as Ambassador to Luxembourg, which is now being blocked by multiple holds by Members of this Chamber. If we truly believe in the claim of equality and the universal principle of fairness of the Declaration of Independence, and if we want to talk more broadly about values with true credibility in this Chamber, I think we owe Mr. Hormel a chance to be evaluated by the same standards we have applied to other nominees. We owe him a chance to be judged by his career and competence, not by his sexual orientation. We owe him a vote on this floor. 
If we truly hope to repair the moral breach that separates us and prevents us from confronting what most Americans agree is a crisis of values, I think we have to start by recognizing that the tone of the debate matters as much as the substance. We need to declare a cease-fire in the culture wars, to lay down our rhetorical arms, step back and look at the person across the PTA meeting room or the abortion clinic or the affirmative action rally not as the enemy, but as a fellow American, deserving of the same respect and courtesy we all expect for ourselves, who happens to have a different, deeply held point of view. We need to build on the common moral ground staked out by the call to civil society and begin to reassert in public life those fundamental values that, despite the collateral damage of the culture warring, continue to connect our incredibly diverse populace. 
I think the largest responsibility, the first responsibility, falls on those of us who are concerned about the weakening of our common values and the ramifications for our society. We have to acknowledge that many of our fellow citizens not only feel uncomfortable talking publicly about matters of morality, they are also skeptical of those who do. Indeed, one of the great ironies of our time is that many Americans have come to regard morality as a code word for intolerance. So our challenge today is to persuade the skeptics that it is crucial for the future of our country to rediscover those common core principles that made our democracy possible in the first place--those common core principles that were described, declared in the Declaration of Independence--and to renew their strength. We in Congress have the opportunity and the responsibility to support the search for common moral ground. 
From those of us who have been privileged and honored to be elected to lead this country, the American people have a right to know that we hear their anxieties about the Nation's moral future, that we are striving to reflect their core values in our work and in our lives. But more than that, we have to recognize that so much of what we aspire to in this body, by passing legislation to serve the public interest and make this a better country, will ultimately be for naught if we do not fill the values vacuum in American life and rediscover, reclaim the high ground, the common moral ground. 
For those reasons, I hope, in the months ahead, to return to the Senate floor, this historic Chamber that truly serves as the American people's forum, to speak with my colleagues from across this great country about different aspects of the values crisis that I have discussed today and to try to offer some specific ideas about how, together, we can better secure, `the Safety and Happiness' that our Declaration of Independence promises us all. 
I thank the Chair and my colleagues for their patience. I yield the floor.

Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to express my strong support for the teacher training amendment that Senator Bingaman has offered. I am proud to be his prime cosponsor, and I want to thank the Committee leadership for agreeing to accept this provision as part of the managers' amendment. 
The proposal we have put forward addresses an issue critical not just to the future of our public schools but to our nation as a whole--the quality of teachers who will be preparing our children to be productive 21st century citizens and to compete in the Information Age economy. 
There is growing evidence that many of the education schools charged with developing the next generation of teachers are failing at their fundamental mission. Our amendment seeks to focus attention on this problem, to push these seedbeds of teaching to set higher standards for their graduates, to hold them accountable when they don't, and ultimately to raise up the quality of the next generation of American teachers. 
To understand the importance of this problem, it is important to first put it into the context of today's education debate. We all recognize that we have many outstanding public schools and many outstanding teachers working in them, men and women who are heroes in every sense of the word, for their dedication to helping America's students to fulfill their potential and realize their dreams. But it is becoming readily apparent that there are also many schools that are not meeting our expectations, that are failing to provide many students with the academic skills they need to succeed in an increasingly knowledge-based labor market, and that in particular are denying a distressing number of inner city children any chance of escaping the poverty and hopelessness that surrounds them. 
We hear this over and over from parents, who tell us that they are deeply concerned about the health of our education system and who list improving our schools as their top priority. And we see this over and over in the mounting number of alarming studies and surveys that have been released recently, which taken collectively indicate that we remain a nation at risk even 15 years after that landmark report was issued. 
One of the most publicized and compelling warning signs came from the latest results of the TIMSS test, which showed that our 12th-graders ranked near the bottom of the world in their knowledge of math (19th out of 21 nations) and science (16th out of 21). Our advanced students did even worse, scoring dead last in physics. 
Another troubling indicator came from a broad Public Agenda survey of employers and college professors, the prime consumers of K-12 education in this country, which found profound dissatisfaction with the way public schools are preparing students. More than 60 
percent of employers and three quarters of professors said they believe that a high school diploma is no guarantee a student has learned the basics, and nearly 7 out of 10 employers said the high school graduates they see are not ready to succeed in the workplace. 
With this heightened scrutiny, it is becoming clear that a big part of the problem is the caliber and performance of many of the teachers we count on to help our children meet the increasingly high standards we are setting for them. The fact is that many college students who choose to go into teaching today fall near the bottom of their peer group academically--a survey of students in 21 different fields of study found that education majors ranked 17th in their performance on the SAT. For those that go on to become secondary school teachers, a stunning member lack any expertise in their core field of instruction--one national survey found 36 percent did not major or even minor in their main teaching subject. 
Also alarming is the dismal performance of many teaching candidates on state licensing and certification exams and other assessments of their qualifications. In Hawaii, for example, more than half of the 986 hires made in this past school year either failed to pass or complete certification tests that by all accounts have generous cut-off scores. In Long Island, only one in four teaching candidates in a pool of 758 could pass an English test normally given to 11th-graders. And most recently in Massachusetts, in a case that has received national media attention, 59 percent of the 1,800 candidates who took the state's first-ever certification exam flunked a literacy exam that the state board of education chairman rated as at `about the eighth-grade level.' 
The situation in Massachusetts has generated real outrage, and for good reason. Studies have shown conclusively that the quality of teaching is one of the greatest determinants of student achievement, and also that low-performing students make dramatic gains when they study with the most knowledgeable teachers. So we should be deeply troubled by the trends we are seeing, especially when we consider that the surge in student enrollment we're expected to face over the next decade will necessitate the hiring of up to 2 million new teachers. If we do not confront this problem now, we could be facing an incompetence boom in our schools that would doom our hopes of true education reform. 
A number of states have begun to respond to the crisis in teacher quality and reevaluate their standards for certification and the tests they use to judge subject knowledge. Texas in particular has been at the forefront of this movement, implementing a comprehensive teacher quality and accountability plan that among other things will crack down on education schools that continually churn out unqualified graduates. 
But this is truly a national problem that demands a national response, and the legislation we are considering today offers us a valuable opportunity to do something concrete to fix this problem. The underlying bill makes an important step in that direction through the new teacher training title it creates, which will encourage states and local school districts to: set tougher standards for their certification exams; expand efforts to recruit top-notch teachers in high-need content areas like math and science; improve their professional development programs for veteran teachers and mentoring programs for newcomers; and to create new 
partnerships that will draw on the expertise and resources of the business and higher education communities to produce better, more knowledgeable teachers. 
The amendment that Senator Bingaman and I have proposed, and that the Committee leadership graciously accepted, is meant to be a complement to that new title, in that it targets the problem of teacher quality at its source, the nation's education schools. While there are many excellent training programs interspersed throughout the country, there are also a surprising number of schools that are routinely graduating inept teaching candidates. Many of these aspiring instructors are incapable of passing even the most watered down certification or licensing exams--in fact, the pass rate at more than a few schools is below 50 percent. This situation is simply unacceptable, given the children's lives involved, and we believe our amendment will go a long way toward fixing it. 
Among other things, our proposal would force the states, local school districts and the general public to confront the severity of this problem. The truth is that most people don't know how poor some of these teacher training programs are, in large part because most ed schools do not disclose their pass rates as other professional schools generally do. Our amendment would change that by requiring education schools to widely publicize the results of their graduate's performance on state certification and licensing exams. It would also require each state to collect a broad array of data to produce a report card on teacher quality, which in turn would be forwarded to the Department of Education to compile a national report card, allowing us to measure for the first time the caliber of America's teaching force. 
But this amendment, which is comparable to a provision the House passed overwhelmingly, is not just about opening our eyes to bad programs. It's about closing the door on the worst of them, and holding those chronic underperformers accountable. Under our plan, states that receive funding under the Higher Education Act would be required to identify those teacher training programs that are failing and to then take action against them if they do not improve, including withdrawing state approval and terminating financial support. To show that we mean business at the Federal level, our amendment would disqualify any education school from participating in the Federal student aid programs if a state goes so far as to sever its ties with that program. 
Mr. President, we recognize that this legislation on its own will not magically turn every new teacher into Socrates. It is going to take a lot of hard work in each school district and each individual state to change the way we have been operating for many years. We are convinced that this plan will help to lay the groundwork for a new national effort to improve teacher quality, and will thereby make a significant contribution to our broader goal of lasting education reform. Our optimism has been reaffirmed by the broad bipartisan support this amendment has received here in the Senate and the House and by the welcome endorsement we received from both major teachers unions. 
Again, I want to express my appreciation to the bill managers for their willingness to accept our amendment, and I look forward to its passage. Thank you.

Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to offer my strong support for the pending amendment and for the substitute Product Liability Reform Act of 1998, S. 2236. This is a good bill, and I am proud to be one of its original co-sponsors. It is the product of incredibly hard work and tremendous dedication by Senator Rockefeller and Senator Gorton, and I want to congratulate--and thank--them and their staffs for what they have been able to achieve. I also want to thank the President for his willingness to work with us to come up with a package that now has his full support. 
I, frankly, would have liked a stronger bill, like the one we passed last Congress, but the President vetoed that bill. That is something that I think all those of us who support reform have to keep in mind as we move forward with this bill. Because even if it doesn't incorporate everything we wanted, this bill does offer much--together with the promise of the President's signature. 
The President's promise is important not just to those of us who have long supported legal reform. It also should be important to my colleagues who have not. I hope it prompts them to take a serious look at this bill--to put aside preconceived notions they may have of product liability reform, and to take a fresh look at what we have done. Many of the provisions they have complained about in the past are gone--the bill does nothing to limit joint and several liability, for example, and it does not impose any caps on punitive damages for any but the smallest of businesses.

Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to make a few very brief comments on the Product Liability Reform Act of 1998, which the Senate will soon be considering. I will make more lengthy remarks on this bill when we return from recess and move on to this bill, but I did not want to let the bill's introduction last night pass without comment. 
This bill is a good bill, and I am proud to be one of its original co-sponsors. It is the product of incredibly hard work and tremendous dedication by Senator Gorton and Senator Rockefeller, and I want to congratulate--and thank--them and their staffs for what they have been able to achieve. I also want to thank the President for his willingness to work with us to come up with a bill that now has his full support.

That is something that I think all those of us who support reform have to keep in mind as we move forward with this bill. Because even if it doesn't incorporate everything we wanted, this bill does offer much--together with the promise of the President's signature. 
The President's promise is important not just to those of us who have long supported legal reform. It also should be important to my colleagues who have not. I hope it prompts them to take a serious look at this bill--to put aside preconceived notions they may have of product liability reform, and to take a fresh look at what we have done. 
Mr. President, this bill offers meaningful--and fair--reform of our legal system to redress the system's abuses while at the same time protecting consumers' rights. And it contains the provisions of a bill Senator McCain and I have been working on for a couple of Congresses: the Biomaterials Access Assurance Act. 
The Biomaterials bill is the response to a crisis affecting more than 7 million patients annually who rely on implantable life-saving or life-enhancing medical devices--things like pacemakers, heart valves, artificial blood vessels, hydrocephalic shunts, and hip and knee joints. These patients are at risk of losing access to the devices because many suppliers are refusing to sell biomaterial device manufacturers the raw materials and component parts that are necessary to make the devices. The reason: suppliers no longer want to risk having to pay enormous legal fees to defend against product liability suits when those legal fees far exceed any profit they make from supplying the raw materials for use in implantable devices. Although not a single biomaterials supplier has ultimately been held liable so far, the actual and potential costs of defending lawsuits has caused them to leave this market. A study by Aronoff Associates found that 75 percent of suppliers surveyed were not willing to sell their raw materials to implant manufacturers under current conditions. That study predicts that unless this trend is reversed, patients whose lives depend on implantable devices may no longer have access to them. 
The Biomaterials title of the Product Liability bill responds to this crisis by allowing most suppliers of raw materials and component parts for implantable medical devices to gain early dismissal from lawsuits. At the same time, by allowing plaintiffs to bring those suppliers back into a lawsuit in the rare case that the other defendants are bankrupt or otherwise judgment proof, it ensures that plaintiffs won't be left without compensation for their injuries if they can prove a supplier was at fault. Mr. President, I have a summary of the bill here, and I ask unanimous consent that it be printed after this statement in the Record. 
I will have a lot more to say about the Biomaterials provisions and the entire bill when we return from recess. For now, let me just once again congratulate Senator Gorton, Senator Rockefeller and the President for their success in forging this compromise bill. I urge my colleagues to support it.

 Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleagues, the original cosponsors of S. 1305, the members of the Senate Science and Technology Caucus, and Senator Breaux, as an original cosponsor of S. 2217, the Frist-Rockefeller Federal Research Investment Act. This is the next step in the effort to restore federal civilian R&D investments to their historical levels and assure American leadership in science, technology, and innovation into the 21st century. 
I was pleased to introduce last October, along with Senators Gramm, Bingaman, and Domenici, the National Research Investment Act of 1998, S. 1305, which now has 19 cosponsors. S. 1305 has been an important coalition-building vehicle that served to galvanize support for federal R&D programs within the Congress. It is time, now, to move forward with a new legislative instrument that can move through the committee process and onto the floor. 
The Frist-Rockefeller bill adds an important policy piece to the Senate effort to double federal R&D investments--based upon the work this year of the Senate Science and Technology Caucus, which I co-Chair along with Senator Frist--and adds performance-based accountability provisions to ensure the quality of programs funded with new monies. The policy piece is especially valuable because it outlines an investment strategy that can serve as a useful complement to the very important efforts of the House Science Committee in drafting a national policy for federal R&D programs. 
We must fund research and development at levels commensurate with their contribution to the health and welfare of our citizenry. America's research enterprise is the most competitive and productive in the world. The strength of our innovation system depends on the steady stream of 
discovery that flows out of our nation's universities and industrial and national laboratories. The creation of new knowledge, and the education and training that is part and parcel of the knowledge-creation process, are critical enablers of wealth creation and future economic growth. I believe that adequately funding R&D and advanced scientific and technical education are two of the most effective measures we can undertake to promote the health and prosperity of America's high-tech economy. 
I welcome the leadership of Senators Frist and Rockefeller. I look forward to working with them to assure the continued success of America's science and technology enterprise. 
I'd like to take a moment to acknowledge the important work of the many people representing research and educational organizations who have labored long and hard to raise the level of understanding of those of us in Congress with respect to the contribution research makes to our national well being. They have helped to lay the groundwork for this legislation that was introduced today. Among those who have contributed to this effort are: 
Mike Lubell and Frances Slakey, American Physical Society; 
David Schutt and Melissa Kuckro, American Chemical Society; 
Greg Schuckman and Pete Leon, American Association of Engineering Societies; 
Kathy Tollerton, American Society for Engineering Education; 
Mike Matlack, the National Society of Professional Engineers; 
Raymond Paul, Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers; 
Suzy Glucksman, American Society of Mechanical Engineers; 
Sam Rankin, American Mathematical Society; 
David Peyton, National Association of Manufacturers;

Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise to oppose the 
amendment offered by my friend and colleague from New Hampshire. If I may respond in one sense directly to what the proponent of the amendment said about going on record, I want to make very clear that I oppose the amendment because I feel that America's involvement in the implementation force and in the stabilization force has been critically important to the return of peace to that region, has been critically important to American prestige and credibility militarily in the world, and has been critically important to the stature and force of NATO. That is about as unambivalently as I can express it. 
I think American involvement in Bosnia has been a remarkably successful involvement at a time when it was very important to draw a line in Europe against aggression, against genocide, and to indicate--more than indicate, to make very clear at the end of the cold war that we were not going to stand idly by, that NATO was not going to stand back, idly by, and allow the disintegration of sections of Europe that could have led to a wider war. 
So I am unambivalently proud of the involvement that has occurred there, am supportive of it, and do not want to send any mixed messages. I want to oppose the Senate sending any mixed messages to our allies, to those who were previous combatants in the war in Bosnia--indeed, and most important, to our own troops there--not to send any mixed messages to any of them about the support of the Congress of the United States for the mission that our troops are performing there. 
Looking back to the early 1990s when this conflict broke out, it was my honor to work alongside the former majority leader, Senator Dole, first trying to urge an end to the arms embargo on the Bosnians who were being slaughtered and were the victims of genocide, and then to urge the United States to lead NATO into doing something to stop this conflict. 
We have been involved in three wars in Europe in this century, two world wars and one long, costly, dangerous cold war. It seemed to many of us that the lessons from those conflicts were to act as early as possible to contain just the kind of conflict that was occurring in Bosnia from spreading. And we battled, Senator Dole and I and others in both parties--battled the administration, first the Bush administration and then more directly, as the conflict in Bosnia became more desperate, the Clinton administration, to get involved, to exercise leadership, to be at least fair with the Bosnians and give them arms. 
Finally, the resolution to lift the arms embargo did pass in the early part of 1995, here, with bipartisan support. There was a significant Croatian offensive on the ground, which was making headway, which contributed to a changing strategic situation on the ground. And Srebrenica fell, with a disastrous loss of life which was exposed to the world. And then there were airstrikes on Serbian positions. The fear that we had was that this was an indomitable force, one that we could not stop. There were recollections of the futile attempts by the Nazis to suppress the Serbs. In this case, the power of NATO from the air had the effect of bringing the combatants to the peace table in Dayton, the State of the Presiding Officer, where a historic peace agreement was signed. 
This implementation force, followed by the stabilization force, in which the United States contributed troops, has been critical to implementing that Dayton agreement. Our presence there has always been less than half. The majority of the effort has been provided by our European allies and others. And, as success has been attained, the number of troops has been scaled down again. And yet it goes down again--now, I believe, below 7,000, I think maybe closer to 6,500. As a result of the effort of these troops in IFOR and then followed on by SFOR, the conflict has ended, hostilities have ended, and there is a slow, steady implementation of the Dayton peace agreement, the military and the civilian components of that. IFOR and SFOR have been charged with carrying out that agreement. 
The economy is up and beginning to flourish again. Elections have been held; common institutions are beginning to be developed. In the Serbian Republic, Srspka, an extraordinary turn of events has occurred as a result of, first and most important, I think, the desire of the Bosnian Serbs to have new leadership, not the leadership of indicted war criminals like Karadzic and Mladic, but to see new leadership. But that was assisted by some very aggressive, determined involvement by the SFOR, particularly by American leadership leading up right to the Supreme Allied Commander in Europe, General Wesley Clark, who has performed, in my opinion, with extraordinary skill and effectiveness in this arena of, first combat, and now peacemaking, followed by some very effective involvement by Ambassador Bob Gelbard in the political situation in Srspka, resulting in new leadership: 
President Plavsic now, Prime Minister Dodik, proud Serbian nationalists, but committed to the Dayton peace accord. 
The progress goes on. Benchmarks have been provided, civilian benchmarks have been provided to us by the administration to determine progress as we go along, all of it leading to a hopeful withdrawal and an end date. 
Mr. President, along the way, some mistakes have been made. The Senator from New Hampshire mentioned them; others have as well. As part of the earlier involvement, there were those in the administration who offered deadlines for withdrawal of American forces. I presume that some measure of the motivation for doing that was to reassure Congress that this involvement would be limited. But those deadlines were always, in my opinion, a mistake. They were a mistake because why would one want to state a date by which one would withdraw from an uncertain situation? 
Traditional policy would be in a conflict or in a peacemaking situation, one withdraws when one achieves the goals of the involvement. So the deadline was always a mistake. 
It was a mistake in another sense because it would send a message to those hostile to our involvement there in the first place, who want to reignite the conflict, that there is a date on which we are getting out. They could lay back and wait until NATO forces, IFOR and SFOR, including the U.S. leadership, left. 
I feel that the proposal here for a vote and the more indirect references in the amendment that was just voted on for withdrawal, head back in the direction of the setting of deadlines, and they have some of the same deficiencies that I think were part of the deadline which the administration set, which most all of us in the Senate condemned and see now as a mistake. 
My own feeling is that we are on the right course in Bosnia; that this is all moving in the right direction, both in terms of implementation of the Dayton accords and scaling back the number of American personnel who are there on the ground. I think if we now enter and say we are going to have a vote on whether to go forward, and if we don't vote to do so, in the middle of the next fiscal year, March 31, 1999, that we will withdraw, that puts a cloud over our involvement.

Mr. LIEBERMAN. If I may say to the Senator from Michigan, that is exactly the understanding of the impact of the amendment offered by the Senator from New Hampshire, which is that if there was a negative vote by March 31 of next year on our American involvement in Bosnia, that the only thing funds would be available for would be to withdraw our personnel.

Mr. LIEBERMAN. Fine, Mr. President. The statement Senator Levin made was exactly my understanding and was what I saw in the draft. The direct effect of a negative vote next March would be to terminate funding of our operations except to withdraw. I await clarification on that, but I must say again, because I support this involvement, I support the command overseeing it, and I support the soldiers in the field, I don't want to set a date down for this kind of vote on our involvement in Bosnia. 
For those who are against it, they always have the option to try to eliminate funding for it through the appropriations process. I think to state a date by which we are going to vote next year on whether to remain involved in Bosnia or not hangs a sword of uncertainty in this case over the entire operation, over the American troops that are there, over our NATO allies who have said they will leave when we leave: `We went in together, we are going out together.' That is what I have heard them say over and over again. Again, it raises the prospect in the minds and hearts of those who are waiting to resume this conflict that they may well have the opportunity come next spring, because the U.S. Senate may vote to terminate this involvement. 
I do want to say about our troops there, I have had the occasion to be there now three times in the last year, as it happens: once last July in a delegation headed by Senator Lott, and the distinguished occupant of the Chair was with us; once in December, right before Christmas, when we went over with President Clinton to visit the troops; and then again in February when I went with a delegation headed by Senator McCain. 
One thing that struck me was the very high morale of American troops that are part of this peacemaking mission in Bosnia. I have had the opportunity as a member of the Armed Services Committee--the honor, really--to visit American soldiers in the field around the world. I must tell you that I have never met a group of American soldiers who had a better, clearer, more positive feeling about why they were somewhere around the world. 
It struck me as particularly interesting and encouraging, because right now they are not involved, certainly not involved in active combat. They are active, they are peacemaking, they are patrolling, but they are involved in a lot of civilian activity. They understand why they are there. 
One of them said to me that once a month, he went into an orphanage, somewhere around Sarajevo, as some of the troops there do, and visited some children who were orphans as a result of the war in Bosnia. He said, `You know, when I go there, I understand why we are here. We are here to stop more children on all sides from becoming orphans; 
to keep people alive and to help this country to rebuild itself.' 
And I fear that any of these amendments we pass here that incline toward withdrawal or state the necessity for a vote on withdrawal by a date certain puts a cloud over the mission of our personnel in Bosnia and runs the risk of diminishing the morale, understandably, of our troops there as well as those who have led them so ably. 
I do want to take just a moment, Mr. President, to explain, consistent with what I have said here, why I voted against the previous amendment offered by Senator Thurmond and Senator Levin, a worthy attempt to achieve consensus, and in fact it did achieve consensus since the vote was 90-5 on it. It was not an easy vote to vote against, to be one of the five. 
But I was concerned about it because on page 3, beginning in paragraph (2), it does say that: 
The President should work with NATO allies and other nations * * * participating in the NATO-led Stabilization Force to withdraw United States ground combat forces from Bosnia and Herzegovina within a reasonable period of time, consistent with the safety of those forces and the accomplishment of the Stabilization Force's military tasks. 
Well, it is not a direct withdrawal. It does condition it on the accomplishment of the stabilization force's military tasks, but, to me, it inclines toward withdrawal as a matter of policy. Because I am so proud of what has been accomplished as a result of the stabilization force that we have led, and because I am so committed to a withdrawal that occurs consistent with the achievement of the goals, the benchmarks that the administration and NATO have set down for this mission, I was troubled by that paragraph as well as the succeeding paragraphs which suggest the possibility that there might be a need for continued military presence there but that we should consider that it be a NATO-led force without the participation of U.S. ground combat forces. 
I think once we begin to do that, once we begin to separate ourselves from NATO, we begin to diminish the unity of that greatest military alliance in history and we begin to diminish our leadership of NATO. And I do not think any one of those is in our national security interest. The fact also is, as I mentioned briefly a moment ago, our NATO allies--the Brits, the French, Germans--all of them have said, `We went in together. We're going out together. So when the United States departs from Bosnia, we're all leaving.' 
So on a practical ground, I do not think we have that option. I think the option is to hang in there together, continue what has been a remarkably successful mission, and we can see the end in sight. But let us not force it. Let us let it come naturally as we achieve the benchmarks. 
So that is why I voted against the previous amendment No. 2975, and all the more so for the current amendment, because it puts us on a course to vote on withdrawal and sends a mixed signal. 
One of my favorite expressions from the Bible in cases such as this is--I am not going to quote exactly--`If the sound of the trumpet be uncertain, who will follow into battle?' `If the sound of the trumpet be uncertain, who will follow into battle?' And I fear here that the sound from these amendments is uncertain and the effect will be to diminish the morale, the effectiveness, of the remarkably effective high-morale mission 
that American troops have carried out as part of IFOR and SFOR in Bosnia. 
I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.

Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the President and thank my friend from Georgia. 
Mr. President, as the remarks from my friend from Massachusetts indicate, there is a broad and shared concern about the quality of education in our country today that is felt by every Member of this Senate. And I think the question is, What do we do about it? Can we go from that concern to making something happen that will improve the future of our children? 
There is no cure-all here. The way to begin is with a simple, small, but potentially significant idea such as that involved in these education savings accounts. The question is, Will we break out of our own sense that our idea is the only idea that will work and listen to those who have a different 
idea or get together on common ground to allow 1,000 flowers to blossom, to allow doors to open up, to allow a host of reform ideas across this country to be tried? 
That is exactly the spirit of the education savings account bill before us. This is not a bill that comforts the comforted. This is a bill that lightens the burden on the overburdened middle class families of this country who are struggling to enable their children to realize their dream of a better education and therefore a better life ahead of them. 
As the Senator from Georgia says, the income limits in this bill are exactly what they were in the bill that we all voted for. It had strong bipartisan support last year. The Joint Tax Committee analysis of this bill says that 70 percent of the tax benefit from these expanded savings accounts will go to families with annual incomes of less than $75,000. That is the middle class--working, struggling, trying to find a way to get their kids to rise on the ladder of American life, and knowing that the way to do that is with a better education. 
Mr. President, it is true, there are very few poor families who are going to be able to afford to take advantage of this bill. Some will. But I say to my colleagues who want to help the poorest families, support the school choice voucher scholarship bill that Senator Coats and I have put before this Senate and that we will offer as an amendment within the next month or two. 
This is a small step forward to encourage parents to do exactly what the President and the Secretary of Education have asked them to do, which is to get more involved in the education of their children, to save--most of the benefit of this bill will be used by parents of kids in public schools. And the truth is, because the benefits of this bill go right on through college and graduate school, most of the savings will be used for college and graduate school. 
Mr. President, I know the President of the United States has indicated that he will veto this bill. I appeal to him to reconsider that statement. This is a good bill that ought to be the basis of a broader agreement on how to give the parents and children and teachers and school administrators of our country some room to innovate reform and improve the quality of public education. 
I urge the President not to use that veto pen, but instead to ask my colleague from Georgia and others who support this bill to come up to the White House. Let us sit down and reason together and see whether we can use this bill as the basis of a broader agreement on education improvement in our country. 
The conference committee, the majority of whom were members of the Republican Party, took some steps in the direction of accommodation. They removed the school block grant and the testing amendments which were objectionable to most Democrats. That creates a spirit of compromise. I urge the President to respond to that by moving toward the sponsors of this bill and seeing if we can attach to it, in some fashion here legislatively, some of the school construction and reduction of school size proposals that are good proposals that the President has made. 
The point is, this conference report offers us an opportunity. Let's not respond to it defensively and rigidly. Let's keep in mind not the status quo, those with a vested interest in the status quo of our education system, but the millions of our children who are not receiving a good education in our schools today. Let's give them the opportunity to dream and realize their dreams. 
I thank my colleagues. I urge a vote for this conference report. 
I yield the floor.

 Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise to honor one of America's earliest diplomats and a distinguished native of Connecticut, Joel Barlow. On June 28, in a modest ceremony, a bronze biographical tablet will be dedicated to Barlow in the churchyard of the tiny village of Zarnowiec, Poland, where Barlow died and was laid to rest in 1812. The event is organized and the tablet donated by the Joel Barlow Memorial Fund, in cooperation with the American Center of Polish Culture and DACOR, Diplomatic and Consular Officers Retired (of the U.S. State Department). 
Joel Barlow was born in 1754 and raised in Redding, Connecticut. His ancestors were among the earliest settlers of the region. After graduating from Yale University in 1778, he took an additional Divinity course and joined George Washington's army as a chaplain, serving for three years until the end of the Revolution. He slipped home from his army duties long enough to marry Ruth Baldwin, the sister of a Yale classmate. They married in secret because of her father's initial objection. 
At the close of the war in 1782, the couple moved to Hartford, where Barlow helped publish the magazine `American Mercury,' writing political pamphlets, satires, and poetry. He was one of a group of satirical writers, mostly Yale men, known as the `Hartford Wits.' At that time, he also completed and published the first version of his American verse epic, `The Vision of Columbus.' It is said that in this work, he was the first writer in English to use the words `civil,' `civic,' and `civilization' in their modern senses. He also envisioned a future international council very much like today's United Nations, dedicated to peacekeeping, cultural exchange, and development of the arts. 
In 1786, Barlow studied law and was admitted to the Bar. He worked as a promoter for the Scioto Land Company. In 1788, Barlow went to Paris to promote the sale of the Scioto Land, a huge tract of Ohio wilderness opened by the government for settlement, to European emigrants. A large group of bourgeois French refugees traveled to Ohio to settle in the land, but the American promoters had not made any preparations for their reception, and they met terrible privations in the wilderness. By the time Ruth joined her husband in Paris in 1790, American organizers of the Scioto company were exposed as profiteering frauds; Barlow, however, was proven innocent. The colony, called Gallipolis, survived despite the hardships, but Barlow's reputation with his countrymen had been seriously damaged. 
Barlow was in Paris during the fall of the Bastille on July 14, 1789. He was a friend of Thomas Paine and other Revolutionary sympathizers, English and American. He wrote his major tract `Advice to the Privileged Orders' and his verse-satire `The Conspiracy of Kings' in London, where he and Ruth had gone to avoid the Jacobin disorders. The `Advice' so offended the British government that it banned the book and tried to arrest Barlow, who fled into hiding in Paris. His `Letter to the National Convention of France,' a proposal for a new French constitution, so impressed the Assembly delegates that in 1792, they made him an honorary citizen of the new Republic, an honor he shared with Washington, Hamilton, Madison, and Paine. In the final throes of the Terror, when Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette were executed in 1793, Barlow was in southeast France helping organize the Savoy, newly captured from Italy, as a political division of the new Republic. 
Fluent in French, sympathetic to the Republic, and successful in business, the Barlows were popular with the reformers and intelligentsia, as well as such scientific innovators as the balloonist Montgolfier. They were also close to Robert Fulton, who arrived in France in 1797, and worked for some years on prototypes of his steamboat, torpedo boat, and other engineering projects. Fulton later did the illustrations for a large, handsome second version of Barlow's epic, heavily revised and retitled `The Columbiad,' published in Philadelphia in 1807. 
In 1796, during Washington's second term, Barlow resolved our first hostage crisis. He was sent to Algiers as consul to help with implementation of our peace treaty with that state and to secure the release of over one hundred American seamen, some of whom had been held captive by Algerian corsairs since 1785. This required great patience and diplomatic skill on his part, not to mention payment of substantial sums to local officials, but he succeeded where others had failed. He stayed on as consul for a year after the hostages were freed before returning to Paris in 1797. 
After 18 years abroad, the Barlows returned to America in 1805, hoping to spend the rest of their lives at home. Thomas Jefferson wanted Barlow to write an American history, and in 1807, at Jefferson's urging, the Barlows moved to a house and small estate in Washington that Barlow named Kalorama, `beautiful view' in Greek. However, in 1811, President James Madison appointed Barlow as Minister to France. His task was to negotiate for compensation for French damages to American shipping and to make a trade treaty. Reluctant, but always ready to serve his country, Barlow took his wife, as well as his nephew Thomas as secretary, and returned to France in 1811. Once there, however, Barlow met nothing but delays because of Napoleon's wars in Europe. 
Finally, the Emperor, engaged in a winter campaign against Russia, summoned Barlow to meet with him in Poland, in Wilna (now Vilnius). But the French armies were utterly defeated by the Russians and the winter. Napoleon fled south, ignoring his appointment. With Thomas, his staff, and other diplomats, Barlow fled through the freezing weather toward Germany to escape the pursuing Cossacks, missing Napoleon, who hurried straight to France. Barlow died of pneumonia in Zarnowiec, between Warsaw and Krakow, on December 24, 1812. (There is a disagreement about the date; the existing church tablet in Poland gives it as December 26.) It took his nephew more than two weeks to bring news of his death to Ruth in Paris, and it was three months before the news reached America. Joel Barlow was mourned widely in France, but back at home, President Madison was more distressed by the loss of the treaty than of the man. Perhaps this diplomat, patriot, and man of letters had stayed away for too long.

Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Chair. I thank my friend from Virginia for the statement he has made. I know all Members of the Senate will be on notice accordingly. 
I take this moment to speak generally to the amendment that is before the Senate regarding China policy and the overall question before the country about China policy, as President Clinton prepares to leave for China later this week. 
Mr. President, this debate is nothing new. Nonetheless, it takes on a special meaning and intensity, because it happens in the week in which the President will go to China. I understand the Senator from Arkansas, who is the proponent of most of the amendments, has stated over and over again that it was not his intention that these amendments be brought up in the week in which the President was going to China, and I know that is absolutely the fact. These amendments were filed earlier. He had discussed them earlier. It just happens that here we are on this bill, and they are coming up. 
I hope that we will proceed, may I say, with an appropriate sense of respect for the mission that the President will carry out on all our behalf, because, though we may have different sides of this American policy towards China that we speak to on the floor, I know that we all hope and pray that the President's trip will be successful, in the sense that it will not only strengthen our bilateral relationship with China, but will do so based on honest exchange and principle, including the very principles that are the subject of some of the amendments that are before us, most particularly human rights, proliferation, which is to say security, and trade policy, and the others as well. 
Mr. President, this question of our relationship with China is, in some ways, the most difficult, complicated and yet the most important of our foreign and defense policies because of the size of China, the enormous changes that are occurring in China, and the significant role that China will play in the next century as a true military, economic superpower. The question of our policy is often described as a choice between engagement or nonengagement, which is to say engagement, on the one hand, or isolation and containment on the other. 
Well, I favor engagement. I think that the truth is when you come down to it, there are very few people here that I have heard in the Senate who really want to isolate China, or that is the stated intention of their policy. The question then becomes, I believe, not whether or not to engage; China is too big for us not to engage with; we are too sensible for us to try to isolate or contain this great country with such a long and proud history. The question then becomes, How do we engage? And do we engage in a way that works together in an honest, principled fashion to not only improve our relations--military, economic, ideological, philosophical--but to improve the lot, the plight, the lives of people in China consistent with our own principles. 
My fear is that some of the amendments that are offered here on this bill, and some of the statements of intention that have been made regarding American policy toward China, while they may want a form of engagement or they may acknowledge the inevitability of engagement with China, they do so in a way that is confrontational, in some sense is punitive, perhaps without justification for all the punitive qualities, and in the end will put us in a course of conflict with China which many of us feel is not necessary. That, I think, is the issue drawn by these amendments. Yes, engagement, but what kind of engagement will it be? 
On the other side there is an engagement that would be so devoid of honesty and principle that it would sacrifice America's national interests and our traditional values, human rights being at the top of them, which is to say it would be engagement for the sake of engagement, to yield, if you will, to the People's Republic of China in any point of conflict between us. That is as unacceptable as the policy on the other side of isolation and attempted containment. 
I think we have to see if we can work together here to find a common ground on which we engage honestly and consistent with our principles and interests, which is to say we have an interest--military, economic, philosophical--in engaging China in the world community, in building peaceful relationships and prosperous relationships with her, but that engagement must be honest in the sense that we do not conceal our differences, and principled in the sense that we do not yield on the principles that make us uniquely American. 
I hope out of the kind of debate that--though it is awkward to have it the week that the President is going to China--but I hope that out of the debate that is occurring here on these amendments, and the debate that I am sure will follow on MFN as the days and weeks go by, that we will be able to find a common ground. 
It is not surprising that this debate is occurring. China is not only a big country and an important country, but it is a country with a different culture and history from ours. It is a country that lived under a remarkably rigid, ideological, Communist dictatorship for a long period of time that has seen 
outbursts, spasmodic alterations in the political status quo, and it is different from us. So these differences about how to engage China, what to expect of China, are not surprising. And we express those in the debate that is occurring on this bill. 
My own strong support for the policy of engagement--honest, principled, direct engagement; one that I think is in our national interest--is premised on a conclusion which is that that policy of engagement, begun 26 years ago by President Nixon, followed by every President since of both political parties, has worked. We have had tough times, crises in the relationship--cultural revolution two decades ago; and very fresh, still stinging for us, the tragedy on Tiananmen Square a little less than a decade ago. 
But overall, if you look at the changes, the revolutionary changes within this country, China, I believe the facts indicate that the policy of engagement has produced a China today that is significantly different than the China of two decades ago of the cultural revolution, and one decade ago of the Tiananmen Square tragedy--an atrocity--that it is a country today that is moving in exactly the direction we would want it to, remarkably toward a market economy--and I will speak in a moment more to that--and also more in the direction of human rights than before, though, God knows, not enough. 
But remember, again, we are dealing with a culture and a country very different from ours, a culture and a country during communism and before so large that it lived with the constant fear of the leadership, of the disintegration of this enormous national entity, a country in which leaders have traditionally portrayed themselves as riding on the back of a tiger. But the changes have most assuredly occurred. 
It has been fascinating in the last month or so just to pay a little bit of extra attention to the newspaper reports from China, not so much the political reports, but what might be called feature stories in the press. And they showed a China that is dramatically different, much more like us than it was before. 
There was a story a while back in one of the papers about the fact that half of the villages in China have held elections. It was a concerted effort by the leadership--not unlimited; that is for sure--but a concerted effort by the leadership of China to introduce some form of participatory electoral system in half of the villages in China, almost 500,000 villages. 
There was another story about a professor at a university in Beijing, a brilliant man, from the article, who had an idea for a new technology; this kind of thing that happens around America, particularly in places like Silicon Valley. It did not happen in Communist China. But he found his way to some capital, started a company, and is doing brilliantly. He is excited about his stock options. Wow. That is not one of Mao's--I do not remember stock options being in Mao's little red book. 
There was a different kind of story about a change in the use of the media. Remember, under Mao the television or the propaganda instruments only had one--it was all straight ahead. It was all: `Support Mao. Support the State.' There was a story about a gentleman who is producing the most popular sitcom on television in China. He had been, I am proud to say, in my own State of Connecticut, in Waterford at the Eugene O'Neill Theater for a period of months studying and saw `The Cosby Show' and was inspired by it. I take some license here, but he went back and created the Chinese version of `Cosby,' the most popular show in China at this point. 
There was an announcement of the sale of 3 million state-owned residences to people, to citizens of China, 
property ownership fundamental to our view of the world, not theirs; tens of thousands of State-owned enterprises about to be privatized or closed down because they are inefficient. 
Under the leadership I would describe as revolutionary, of the new Premier, Zhu Rongji, one of the ways in which the Communist State controls the lives and political behavior of all of its citizens is by employing all of its citizens. Once you take these tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands, of State-owned enterprises, privatize them, and people are not working for the State any more but working for private owners, you have the conditions for a whole new expression and experience of freedom--remarkable, remarkable changes. 
Let me talk about religion, because it is of real interest to me. I worked with colleagues and cosponsored one of the two bills before this body that try to put religious freedom and protection from religious persecution and discrimination at the center of our foreign policy and impose penalties on countries or at least alter our relationship with countries that don't respect the bedrock American principle of freedom of religion. 
Last March, Senator Mack, a colleague and dear friend from Florida, and I went to China. It happened to be Holy Week, the week before Easter. Senator Mack went to mass each day. The churches were more or less full. 
Let me read from a New York Times article of just less than a week ago, June 17, so you can get a flavor of the changes that are occurring, and yet the enormous changes that have not yet occurred that we need to have occurring. I will read briefly from the New York Times of June 17, an article by Eric Eckholm, from Nanjing. The article begins with a report that:  
New Bibles stream forth from a computerized printing press in this onetime southern capital at a rate of two and a half million a year for sale to Christians all over China. [Bibles in Chinese, of course.] * * * * * 
Critics in the West point to the restrictions and repression as evidence of systematic persecution, while the Government's defenders here point, instead, to the relative freedom most Christians now enjoy. 
Paradoxically, the rising outcry abroad comes as Christianity in China, especially evangelical Protestantism, is growing explosively. The Rev. Don Argue [many of us are privileged to know in this Chamber], recent president of the National Association of Evangelicals in the United States, says China may be experiencing `the single greatest Revival in the history of Christianity.' 
Much of that growth has occurred with official acquiescence, and though they remain a small minority in a giant country, millions of Chinese people like Zhang Linmei, a 32-year-old worshiper at St. Paul's [in Nanjing], find the same comfort in religion that Christians do anywhere, without worrying much about politics. 
`I feel life is meaningless in society at large,' Zhang said after services as she picked up her 5-year-old daughter, dressed in her finest, from Sunday school. 
`This is the only reliable place in my life,' Zhang added. 
`The situation for religion is in many ways the best it's been since 1949,' [the year of the Communist revolution] said Richard Madsen, an expert on Chinese religion at the University of California at San Diego. Though the Government still controls their growth and closely monitors their activities, he said, the official churches enjoy more autonomy [today] than [ever] in the past. 
Even the illegal churches--[of course, here we get to the problem] unregistered Protestant churches and openly pro-Vatican Catholic groups--function without serious trouble in many places, Dr. Madsen and others say. But those who refuse to pledge support to the Government and its apparatus of religious control, and those with unorthodox or ecstatic styles of worship, can face harsh repression. The situation is similar for other major religions here, including Buddhists and Muslims. Many believers now enjoy relative freedom, but Tibetan Buddhists who consider the Dalai Lama their leader face repression. 
Finally, a few more paragraphs which I think express the explosion in belief and freedom to believe, and yet the repression that still exists for those who trouble and offend particularly provincial administrators, administrators of the various Chinese provinces, or touch a vulnerable cord in the Chinese experience, which is the fear of a loyalty to a force outside of China and beyond the Government. 
I read again from the New York Times article of June 17 last week: 
Officials say Catholics now number four million, while outside researchers say the true total may be closer to 10 million, with many secretly accepting the Pope as the true head of their church. 
The peculiar hybrid state of Christianity here reflects the obsession of the Communist party with control: virtually any organization, whether political or social or religious, must gain party approval. 
The party is an officially atheist organization that asserts that religion will eventually wither away. But in a policy spelled out in the early 1980's, the Government officially guarantees freedom of religion--within prescribed boundaries including a required allegiance to the state, adherence to certain styles of worship and limits on church construction, evangelizing and the baptism of children, among other rules. 
Of course, those are all unacceptable to us. 
For those willing to accommodate, the 1990's seem a golden time. 
`From our perspective, now is the best time ever for implementing the policy of religious freedom,' said Han Wenzao, who as president of the China Christian Council is the national leader of the official Protestant church and a prime link to the Communist Government. `The criterion should be, is the word of God being propagated or not? [And Mr. Han Wenzao says] It is and it's good.' 
Well, that is a rational report, sobering and disappointing in the continuation of official sanctions, repression, anxiety about religion; and yet, clearly, the momentum is all in favor of faith. That, too, represents a maturing, a changing and development within the mind and outlook of the leadership of China. I think it is at least in part a reaction to the centrality that we have placed on religious freedom, absent persecution, in our relations with the People's Republic of China. 
So, I hope we will pass one of these bills that set up a system in our Government to rank and report on the state of religious freedom in all the countries of the world. Of course, I don't favor a specific action regarding the People's Republic of China, because that tends to scapegoat them and it tends to create a confrontation between us separately that is not necessary. They ought to be part of the overall policy that I hope this Senate will adopt, that Congress will adopt, before this session ends and, most particularly, to the events of this week. 
I hope and believe that when the President meets with Jiang Zemin, when he speaks with the people of China publicly, he will raise this question of religious persecution in a way that he couldn't do if he were not engaged and wouldn't do if we were not honestly and principally engaged; he will speak directly to why it is so important to us in America that countries with which we have normal, bilateral relations respect the right of their citizens to worship God as they choose. That was the initial, primal motivation for those who founded this country. It is right there in the first or second paragraph--first substantive paragraph of the Declaration of Independence, in the first amendment to our Constitution, the beginning of the Bill of Rights. It is what we are about. If we are not directly and principally engaged with that, if our President of the United States does not go to China, the kind of progress that I have described in which I say the glass is certainly half full and getting fuller, the opportunities for that will be lost. 
I want to say just a word more about national security, because these amendments, after all, are attached to the Department of Defense authorization bill, S. 2057. 
In a literal sense, a parliamentary sense, it seems to me personally that these amendments are not germane. That is a matter of parliamentary conclusion, which I will leave to others. But I want to say that the question of our relations with the People's Republic of China, the question of how we engage and whether we engage with the People's Republic of China is at the center of our national security policy, of our defense policy today and, even more so, in the next century. 
We have many important security relationships in the world, beginning with our allies in Europe, and in Japan. Our ability to manage our relationship with the People's Republic of China will, in my opinion, as much as any other relation we have, determine whether or not we will live in a world that remains secure in our time, but whether our children, and whether the pages here, as they grow to be adults, will live in a world that is secure. That is the destiny of China--with 1.2 billion people who are building a military, it is strategically located, an enormous country. 
Look at the situations in the world which worry us now--most recently, the explosions of atomic weapons by India and Pakistan on the Asian subcontinent. Our ability to work with them, as we have been doing since those explosions, greatly strengthens our capacity to limit the possibility that the conflict on the subcontinent will break into a worse conflict, and a nightmare would be a nuclear war. 
Consider where we would be today in implementing the policy on the Asian subcontinent if we were not engaged with China, if we could not work with the permanent five members of the Security Council and with China on a problem such as that. Take the Korean peninsula. We have in excess of 30,000 American soldiers there. It is probably the most heavily armed border in the world. Our ability to keep the peace there and, in fact, to begin to move beyond, in the absence of conflict, to better relations between the parties there is very important to us. It is materially helped by our engagement with China--our ability to work with the two Koreas, China, and the United States to try to create more stability and ultimately, perhaps, a reunification of the two parts of Korea. 
Take our interest in the Persian Gulf, in the Middle East--an interest so clearly vital to our national security that we sent a half million troops there about 7 years ago in the Persian Gulf war. China and United States will begin to have shared interests--and perhaps even if we are not engaged, a shared competition, as China grows economically--for the energy resources in the Persian Gulf area, for the oil. We have to have a good relationship with China to be able to manage that competition for energy in a way that doesn't break into conflict. 
More immediately, the Middle East, Persian Gulf--always a tinderbox in our time--we deeply fear the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, of ballistic missiles, particularly in Iran. My sense is that the engagement with China has assisted us materially in cutting down the flow of component parts to the Iranians for the development of nuclear weapons, which is not so with missile proliferation, as far as I can tell. I hope and trust that the President will discuss that directly with the leadership of China in the summit that is to come later this week. 
But, again, an engagement with China offers us the prospect, in return for what China seeks in our bilateral 
relationship, including not only economic gain but recognition, stature, involvement in world organizations--in return for that, hopefully, we will be in a position to convince the leadership in China to cut back on any of the component parts of ballistic missiles, which they are selling to Iran, or any other countries that threaten our security, because that is part of what it means to be engaged. 
Incidentally, Mr. President, in this regard--and I know there are some amendments that maybe have been put forth that deal with proliferation--this Chamber, a short while ago, passed the Iran Missile Sanctions Act, also passed by the House, on its way to the President. The concern expressed about that bill had mostly to do with its impact on Russia as a major supply of component parts for missile construction in Iran. But Russia is not mentioned in that bill. That is a generic bill. That is the way we ought to deal with problems like proliferation--not to single out the Chinese, but, you know, the PRC, People's Republic of China, will be affected by that legislation, and entities within it will be deprived of doing business with the United States if there is evidence that they are contributing to the ballistic missile capacity of the Iranians. We would not have those opportunities if we were not engaged honestly and in a principled way. 
So I draw the conclusion that though these amendments may, in one sense, parliamentary, be ill placed on this bill, that they touch a larger issue. It is the right issue and the right point, which is that our ability to manage our relations with China in our time, and particularly as we head into the next century, will substantially affect the national security of the United States. 
Let us say we stopped engaging and we attempted to isolate or contain China. Think of the turmoil that would cause to our allies in Taiwan, our great, dear friends and allies in Taiwan. Think about the prospect of an independent--disengaged from the United States--People's Republic of China, growing stronger in the next century. Could our allies in that region--even our best ally, Japan--maintain as close a relationship with us when China was an emerging strength and was hostile to the United States because we attempted to contain them? I think not. 
So, Mr. President, I hope we can find a more constructive course to go forward with than being unnecessarily punitive about everything that happens in the People's Republic of China that doesn't please us. A lot will happen there that doesn't please us. But it is in our overriding national interest, militarily, economically, and ideologically, to continue to be engaged in an honest and direct way. 
In my opinion, there is ultimately no choice. And I hope we can find ways--short of some of the amendments that have been put onto this bill--to reason together and come up with common approaches because, as I said at the outset, as much as I support engagement, engagement cannot allow us to become spineless. I don't think it has been in our time. Since President Nixon, and since Tiananmen, and President Bush, and on into President Clinton, I think we have been strong and demanding. It is an appropriate role for Congress to continue to work with the administration to make sure that is the case. 
Finally, I will offer for the review of my colleagues, at some point, a bill I was privileged to introduce last fall, in October, with three colleagues, which constituted two Republicans and two Democrats, including myself; Senators Bob Kerrey of Nebraska; Chuck Hagel of Nebraska, and Frank Murkowski. I believe it is Senate bill 1303. It is an attempt to create a legislative expression of support for a policy of honest, direct, tough principled engagement with China, 
that is in our interest, and to create some bilateral entities, commissions, and working groups to work through in a demanding way--and some of them including Members of Congress --these points of conflict that we have with China to see if we cannot build on them instead of striking down and undercutting the relationship as a result of those areas in which we disagree. 
I hope at some point to be able to bring this bill to the floor and to either in whole or in part as an amendment ask my colleagues to consider it as an expression of a policy, but also as evidence of a particular way to express that policy to establish a United States-China trade and investment commission, to establish a bilateral energy committee, to establish a bilateral food committee, to establish a U.S. human rights commission to not only create a bilateral dialog on human rights, but for us to have an opportunity directly to speak to the Chinese about how important it is to us, but also to create an opportunity to review the Chinese, province by province, in these areas of concern to us--human rights, proliferation, trade, environment--and to use a carrot instead of a stick, and to offer to those provinces that measure up closer to our standards and ideals: OPIC insurance financing backing, clear access to Eximbank financing that is not available now but only through a Presidential waiver to move constructively, honestly, forward; an understanding that both peoples and both countries have to gain from this involvement, and particularly understanding that the people of China for whose freedom we work and pray and from whose increasing freedom we take great joy. 
They are the ones that I think will ultimately suffer as much as we will from a policy of isolation and containment, and will gain from a policy of direct and principled engagement. 
I thank my colleagues for giving me the opportunity to speak. 
It would be my intention on the motion to table that the Senator from Virginia has said he will put in tomorrow to vote to table, because while I think this has been a constructive debate, I don't think this is the week to be taking action in the way that some of these amendments would, and I don't favor most of the amendments as expressing the kind of policy of engagement that I think is so much in our American national interests. 
I thank my colleagues. I yield the floor.

Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise to express my concern about the portion of this bill dealing with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, and particularly the Committee report. While I appreciate that Senators Domenici and Reid have made very significant changes to an earlier version of the report, I remain troubled. 
Let me say first that I am a supporter of nuclear energy. I believe it can be part of the solution to solving the world's energy, environment and global warming problems. But in order for there to be a future for this industry, it is critical for the public to maintain confidence in the industry--a confidence that must be supported by a strong, competent and effective Nuclear Regulatory Commission. 
I do not believe that the current NRC over-regulates, inspects too much, enforces too much or has adopted an overly restrictive body of regulations. I base this conclusion on the extensive oversight I conducted as chairman during the 103rd Congress of the Clean Air and Nuclear Regulation subcommittee of the Environment and Public Works Committee; the oversight work I have conducted during the last three years as a member of the Environment Committee, particularly growing out of my concern about the shutdown of Connecticut's nuclear power plants; and two extensive reports prepared for me by the General Accounting Office. 
In fact, I believe that as a result of new safety initiatives undertaken by NRC Chairman Jackson, such as: limiting inappropriate use of enforcement discretion; requiring utilities to verify whether they are operating in accordance with their design basis; undertaking a review of NRC oversight of changes made by utilities without prior NRC approval; improving the inspection process;, increased attention to use of quantitative performance indicators; and reforms of the senior management oversight process, the NRC has finally moved toward regaining some of the public confidence which is so important. Also critical to restoring this confidence has been Chairman Jackson's openness and responsiveness to the public, including whistleblowers. Many of these initiatives came in response to a very unfortunate situation in Connecticut, where the nuclear power plants were shut down and put on the NRC Watch List of most troubled plants. 
I appreciate that the Appropriations Committee believes that there should be an in-depth review of the NRC. As a member of the Senate Environment Committee with authorization oversight responsibilities, I have been urging the Committee to conduct hearings on the NRC since the start of the Congress. In particular, I have urged the Committee to hold a hearing to examine the issues raised in two General Accounting Office reports : one prepared for Senator Biden and me, Nuclear Regulation: Preventing Problem Plants Requires More Effective NRC Action, and one prepared for Congressman Dingell and me on whistleblower protections. 
The GAO raised serious concerns about instances in the past in which the NRC has neither taken aggressive enforcement action nor held nuclear plant licensees accountable for correcting their problems on a timely basis. The GAO criticized the NRC for problems in the inspection process, such as not including timetables for the completion of corrective action and for not evaluating the competency of the licensees' plant managers as part of the on-going inspection process. In addition, the GAO found that the senior management meeting, designed to focus attention on those plants with declining safety performance, was not serving its goal of being an early warning tool. 
To her credit, Chairman Jackson has responded to many of these GAO recommendations positively and swiftly. Nevertheless, oversight hearings are needed to evaluate the NRC's responses. 
Finally, although I appreciate that the Committee increased the NRC's funding levels from the subcommittee's approach and eliminated any directions to cut nuclear reactor safety, I am still concerned that the bill includes $17.3 million less in funding than the NRC's budget request. I think a more prudent approach would be to have a detailed discussion of the NRC's proposed initiatives in the authorizing Environment Committee to avoid any negative impact on the NRC's ability to maintain a strong, healthy regulatory program for nuclear power plants or to limit any new initiatives that the NRC believes are important. In the 103rd Congress, I was pleased that we were able to report an authorizing bill for the NRC, but unfortunately it did not become law. We need to move forward again with such a bill.

Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise this afternoon to express my appreciation to Senators on both sides of the aisle, in particular my colleagues on the Environment and Public Works Committee, for all their work in crafting the new six-year transportation bill that is before us. A great deal of the credit must go to Senator Chafee and his staff, especially Jimmie Powell, for their tireless efforts in crafting a compromise bill that resolves a good number of contentious issues. 
 Mr. President, this highway bill reaffirms many of the revolutionary principles established by ISTEA in 1991. Like ISTEA, it provides broad and substantial support for all modes of surface transportation, including transit. It funds important maintenance, safety, and air quality needs as well as the construction of new infrastructure. As the product of difficult House-Senate negotiations, this compromise bill does not include every policy that I would have liked. Yet the bill represents a sound and reasonable basis for strong transportation policy over the next six years, and I support it. 
Finally, let me clarify one provision in the bill. A provision I drafted provides funding for the development of a rail trail in Winsted and Winchester, Connecticut. This provision should be read to include the development of the trail in Torrington, Connecticut, as part of this project. The trail will provide residents with access to trails in Barkhamsted and Canton, Connecticut.

Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Chair and I thank my friend and colleague from Arizona not only for yielding but for his principal support of this legislation and for his outstanding statement. 
I rise to support the Iran Missile Proliferation Sanctions Act and to thank all of those in the Senate who have cosponsored it, principally the distinguished majority leader of the Senate for his strong leadership in this effort. It has been purposeful. It has been balanced. I think it has been quite realistic. 
I think we have before the Senate a measured response to a real problem. The real problem is the development by Iran of ballistic missile capacity, longer-range ballistic missile capacity, which, when combined with attempts within Iran to develop weapons of mass destruction, holds the potential to change the balance of power within the Middle East. 
It is destabilizing. It is threatening to our troops and forces on the waters within the Middle East region. It is threatening to our allies within the Arab world, moderate Arab nations. And it is threatening to our ally, Israel. That is in the short run. 
In the longer run, the development of longer-range ballistic missile capacity by Iran could threaten our allies in Europe in a wider circle around Iran and, eventually, of course, could threaten us directly here in the United States of America. We are dealing here with a very, very serious and concrete challenge to world order and America's national security. 
This measure has been introduced and principally led by the majority leader. I am privileged to have joined with him in that. It is cosponsored by more than 80 Members of the U.S. Senate--84 is the total, I believe. It is in that sense a profoundly bipartisan response to this genuine national security problem. 
I think one of the reasons this measure has gained the broad support that it has is not only because the problem is real, the threat to security from Iran having long-range ballistic missile capacity being real, but because the approach taken in the bill is targeted. 
I will go directly to the language of the bill. `Sanctions shall be applied to every foreign person with respect to whom there is credible information indicating that person'--and of course `person' is given a broad definition of a natural person --`is an alien or a corporation, business, association, partnership, society, trust, or any other nongovernmental entity, organization, or group that is organized under the laws of a foreign country or has its presence, people, or place of business, in a foreign country or any foreign governmental entity operating as a business enterprise in any successor or subsidiary of any entity.' 
So this applies to any entity that comes within that category, that first transferred items on the MTCR, the missile technology control regime annex, or items that the United States opposed for addition to that annex that contributed to Iran's efforts to acquire, develop, or produce ballistic missiles. 
We are talking here about entities that are helping Iran gain the capacity that I have described, as the Senator from Arizona and the Senate majority leader have all described, `to develop ballistic missile capacity or provide technical assistance or facilities which the President deems to be of concern, because of their direct contribution to Iran's efforts.' Again, to acquire or develop ballistic missiles or attempt to transfer such items or attempted to provide technical assistance or facilities. 
That is very direct. Apply sanctions to entities that have actually done something wrong, done something wrong in the judgment of the President of the United States as reported to Congress every year regarding any credible information that occurrences by these entities have transpired to help Iran gain the capacity that we do not want them to gain. 
That applies a series of sanctions in response to that evidence, and gives the President, incidentally, the authority to waive those sanctions if he either obtains additional information that diminishes the content of the original finding or the President determines that the waiver is required, is essential, to the national security of the United States. 
So, it is very targeted and not the broad based, `don't do any business with this country or that country.' But on a finding of credible evidence by the President of the United States that a person, a company, a governmental agency or institute has been assisting Iran in obtaining ballistic missile capacity, then these sanctions are applied and the President may use a waiver. 
What are the sanctions? I will describe them generally: stopping arms sales under the Arms Export Control Act to these entities; stopping the transfer or sale of dual-use items under the Export Administration Act; and the cessation of any U.S. grants or loans or other benefits to these entities. 
Why should we be helping companies or governmental agencies abroad that are contributing to the development of this Iranian ballistic missile capacity which will so threaten our security? 
So it is a very measured approach which, again, I think is at the heart of why this bill before us has over 80 percent of the Senators supporting it, a truly bipartisan measure. 
Mr. President, there are those who will say that things are changing in Iran. So why pass this legislation? Well, from the best that I can determine, there are the beginnings of some changes in Iran. The changes, certainly, have not gone far enough to alter the essential character of the center of that regime, which is still fundamentally hostile and threatening to the United States and threatening to our security. It is still the major sponsor, state sponsor of terrorism in the world which, to the best of our knowledge, has resulted in the deaths of many Americans and many citizens of other countries that are allies of America. Just the finding by the Argentinian security, law enforcement forces earlier this week announced--these are tough cases to investigate--they have traced two attacks, two bombings on Jewish institutions in Argentina directly back, by their judgment, just repeating what I have read in the newspapers, back to Iran. And so it goes. 
So the election of the new President, President Khatami, of Iran, who has been making statements that are more moderate, more open, both in terms of Iran's domestic policy and even international, who gave the important interview to CNN in which he suggested the possibility of opening informal contacts with the United States of America, he still made some statements that are extremely hostile and negative toward us and some of our allies. But, nonetheless, I take these to be encouraging signs. But what remains the fact, as best any of us can determine, is that the much more radical elements within the Iranian Government are still in control of the apparatus of that government--the military, the intelligence, the foreign policy--and, in fact, there is no indication that any of the sponsorship of terrorism has stopped. 
In the meantime, the Senator from Arizona has suggested, as we have heard in classified briefings which cannot be discussed in detail here, the Iranians get ever closer to developing, in a headlong thrust, full force, full-throttle thrust, to developing long-range ballistic missiles. 
Maybe it is going to be hard to stop him from doing this. But the intention of this bill, it seems to me, is an exercise in common sense, the exercise of traditional principles of self-defense. This legislation will help us to delay the date on which Iran will achieve long-range ballistic missile capacity with which it can deliver weapons of mass destruction on those it chooses as enemies, as targets. 
Let's think about it optimistically. Perhaps in that period of time, we will see a fruition of some of the obvious interests, obvious concerns of the people of Iran as expressed in the election of Mr. Khatami for a change. I hope so. 
The people of Iran have no inherent reason--let me put it another way, Mr. President. There is no inherent conflict of interest, strategic interest between the people of Iran and the people of the United States. Unfortunately, since the revolution that occurred in Iran in the late 1970s, we have been set on a confrontational course which threatens the stability of the region and the world and does nothing good for the people of Iran --a gifted people with a proud history. 
So I am hopeful about the changes that are possible within Iran, but, by any reasoned judgment, we have a long way to go yet. These missiles are being developed rapidly and they are going to be aimed at us and our allies. Therefore, this proposal still seems to me to be extremely important and, as I say, very measured and targeted. 
Mr. President, there are those who say, well, OK, you are right, there is a threat from Iran. But this measure is really targeted at Russia. Not only is there hope of change within Iran, but there is even, of course, more substantial change that has occurred, and the hope of change, within the Russian Government, particularly on this issue. So why provoke the Russians? It is the threat of these sanctions from Congress that matters, not the realization of it. 
Let me say first, Mr. President, that on the face of the bill, there is no mention of Russia. This is a piece of legislation that is targeted at any people, any entities, any government, anywhere on the globe that the President has reason to believe is contributing to Iran's development and acquisition of ballistic missile capacity. It could apply to, and might in the past have applied to, companies in allied countries of ours in Western Europe who, in one way or another, may have attempted to sell or sold items to the Iranians, which they have now used or are using in the development of a ballistic missile capacity, or even in the development of weapons of mass destruction. 
Certainly, some evidence suggests that there may be entities within the People's Republic of China who have transferred items, sold items to the Iranians that are used in the development of these threatening programs. North Korea, our relations with them are much more limited; nonetheless, that is another possibility. But it is true, to the best of our knowledge today and in recent years--

Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Senator for his extraordinary graciousness, since we are in disagreement on this particular 
question. Let me summarize the remainder of my argument. 
We know from intelligence sources, some of which had been reported in the press and referred to by the Senator from Arizona, that in recent years, as best we can determine, a number of companies, institutes, and subdivisions within Russia have been involved in transactions, usually for business purposes, with Iran, which are of material technical assistance to Iran, to help in their ballistic missile development program. So, yes, this legislation will apply to Russia. 
We know this has been raised from the highest level of our Government--the Vice President, the National Security Adviser, and others, like Ambassador Frank Wisner and Mr. Gallucci, with the Russians to end this cooperation with Iran. Progress is being made. 
On January 22, which I believe is the exact date, former Prime Minister Chernomyrdin issued an Executive order in which he stated the intention of the government to begin to set some policies for trying to control this activity. Within the last week, although I don't believe we have seen the details of it in this country, the Russian Government has promulgated a detailed series of regulations to carry out Chernomyrdin's order of January of this year. So there is a good-faith effort being made at the governmental level. 
Yet, our intelligence sources--to speak as broadly as I must in these cases--tell us there is still evidence that there are entities within Russia that are continuing to cooperate with Iran in the development of ballistic missile capacity. That is why I think we have to go ahead with this legislation today. But why? I think it is very important to say that it is not directed at the Russian Government. In fact, unless there is clear evidence of complicity by the Russian Government in one of these transfers, sanctions will not go to the Russian Government. They will go to companies, institutes, or subdivisions. I hope our friends, in return--particularly the new government of Mr. Kiriyenko, the National Security Adviser--to give him a title he may not officially have--and the deputy defense minister, Mr. Kokoshin--will clearly understand that this is not directed at them. In fact, when we adopt the amendment to be offered by the Senator from Michigan, which will put the effective date of the gathering of relevant evidence to the date of the Chernomyrdin order in January, then, I think, we will have a law that basically says that America will sanction entities within Russia that are not complying with the clear policy of the Russian Government. 
In that sense, I think this is a very important measure, one that will contribute to our security, one that should not affect our bilateral relations with Russia, and one that could be the basis, I hope in fact, for us going forward to build a bilateral policy with Russia that understands that the strategic reality of the world has changed after the cold war, and that we are no longer in a situation of a bipolar world where each of the great powers, the Soviet Union and United States, are facing each other with intercontinental ballistic missiles and nuclear warheads, and that we are working well together to build down in our weapons through the nuclear weapons, START I and START II; 
but that each of us, Russia and the United States, faces threats from the proliferation of the possession of weapons of mass destruction and the world-changing capacity to deliver those weapons with ballistic missiles. 
So we ought to work together to try to limit the spread of that technology and the danger it will represent not only to the United States and their allies but to Russia and their allies. 
I thank my colleagues for their support of this bill and for giving me the opportunity to speak to it today. I hope that we will adopt it unanimously. I look forward to seeing its implementation and the increase in our security in one of those areas that we know will represent the greatest threat in the generation ahead.

 Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I regret to inform my colleagues in the Senate of the death on Sunday, May 17 of Rabbi Moshe Sherer, President of Agudath Israel of America, a vibrant organization of Orthodox Jews in our country. 
I was privileged to have known Rabbi Sherer for many years and to benefit from his wise counsel. He lived an extraordinarily righteous and productive life, and was a kindly but driving force in the unprecedented growth of his organization and its perspective within America. Rabbi Sherer was also a very successful bridgebuilder to other faith communities in his effort to spread the light of religious truth throughout our country. 
I shall miss Rabbi Sherer, and wish to extend to his wife, Deborah, and his children, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren my condolences and best wishes.

Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Chair. 
I thank my friend and colleague from Michigan, first, for his overall leadership in introducing the underlying bill, which I am pleased to be a cosponsor of, and, secondly, for being very thoughtful and accommodating in including the language he has described in this managers' amendment which would authorize demonstration projects for technical skills training for workers, including incumbent workers through local and regional consortia of private sector groups. 
Mr. President, this accomplishes two breakthroughs, I think. What it is aimed at, first, is to focus not only on folks who are out of work, but people who are in work but need training to hold their jobs and to upgrade themselves. The second is to stimulate companies to work together to train workers in a given area in which there is a regional or local shortage. 
I thank Senator Abraham and the other cosponsors of this amendment and the bill for the work they have done. 
Mr. President, I am one of many Senators who have cosponsored this bill, but I wish to recognize the singular achievements of my colleague, Senator Spencer Abraham, for introducing the bill and for advancing it so thoughtfully, so energetically, and so cooperatively. 
In one sense we are called upon to pass legislation to respond to a crisis, as so often seems the case. Just last week the Immigration and Naturalization Service announced that the 65,000 person cap on H-1B visas for fiscal year 1998 had been reached. Unless we act, for the remaining five months of the fiscal year, American employers will be unable to hire the temporary foreign workers who help fill gaps in our very tight labor market for skilled professionals. With each successive year, the backlog would only grow. Skilled foreign professionals, many of them graduates of our finest universities, would be driven to jobs with our international economic competitors. 
But this crisis is different from other crises, for it reflects the good news that we are in the midst of a period of unprecedented economic growth. The national unemployment rate last month was only 4.3%. Even more remarkable, the unemployment rate for college graduates was only 1.7%. The Bureau of Labor Statistics does not keep statistics for the information technology sector, but most experts estimate that the unemployment rate there has sunk to well below 1%. Various studies are reporting hundreds of thousands of unfilled positions in the high tech sector. Last month representatives of major American corporations like IBM could be found on the beaches of Florida, recruiting college seniors on their Spring Break. 
In short, Americans looking for work are finding jobs like never before. But in certain sectors of the economy, and in certain parts of the country, there are not enough Americans able to fill all of the available jobs. The H-1B program allows employers to hire skilled foreign workers for six-year periods, provided that the employers pay them the same wages that other workers receive, and that the foreign workers are not employed in connection with a strike or a lock-out. All sorts of employers benefit from the H-1B program, from corporations to universities to non-profits, but at the moment it is the rapidly growing hi-tech companies that are most in need of additional skilled workers. 
But it is not just those companies that benefit from the H-1B program: in some senses, all Americans do. That is because the growth of the high tech sector has been a crucial element of our recent economic resurgence. It is vitally important that we keep the jobs associated with this vibrant industry here in the United States and that we keep this industry growing with the innovative ideas of the brightest people we can find. Unfortunately, at the present time our educational system is not producing enough graduates in the relevant fields of math, science, computers and engineering to keep up with demand. The long term solution to this problem is obviously to encourage more education and job training of American citizens in high-tech fields, and S. 1723 does speak to that need by providing $50 million in matching funds for educational scholarships as well as $10 million per year to train unemployed workers in new skills. But in the short term, we must act quickly to ensure that American information technology companies are not forced to slow their domestic operations or, worse, move their operations overseas in search of the skilled foreign workers who would come to the U.S. if given the chance, The skilled foreign workers employed under the H-1B program will keep their employers strong and growing so that they can hire even more American workers. 
Sentor Abraham made an important accommodation in Committee when he modified his bill so that the increase in H-1B visas would sunset after five years. During the first years of that period, the bill calls for a study by the National Academy of Sciences to examine the future training and education needs of American students to ensure that their skills are matched to the needs of the information technology sector. The study would also assess the need by the high-tech sector for foreign workers with specific skills, and would examine the effects of increasing globalization. By the time the increase in visas is set to expire, Congress will have had an excellent opportunity to re-examine the H-1B program in light of additional information and new economic conditions, and hopefully there will be many more skilled American workers to fill these jobs. 
A progressive new idea included in the bill is the authorization of demonstration projects for technical skills training for workers, including incumbent workers, by local and regional consortia of private sector groups. This is a very important addition to the bill, and I want to thank Senator Abraham for including it. Two ideas behind the demonstration projects' authorization language in this bill can be particularly important. First, training our workforce with the skills needed for today's industry must include the training of incumbent workers. Training is now a lifelong process and should not be withheld from people because they already have a job. The Workforce Investment Partnership Act addressed this issue by eliminating the income requirement for some of the Labor Department's adult training programs. We need to turn Labor Department programs into programs that industry wants to partner with, and a large part of that metamorphosis must include incumbent worker training. 
The second important element of these demonstration projects is stimulating companies to work together. We need to change the institutional mind set of American companies so that they will collaborate with each other on training skilled workers for their industry. Many small and medium-sized companies cannot afford to run training programs by themselves. Some of the larger corporations have substantially cut their training programs because skilled workers move quickly from one job to another in today's labor market. Yet, all these companies may be competing in a region for the same pool of skilled labor. It only makes sense for these employers to join together to train workers in these skills. It makes sense for the government to be the coalescing force in bringing these groups together to fill the regional community's needs. We hope that these demonstration projects will show industry how successful such regional skills alliances can be. 
I thank Senator Abraham and the other co-sponsors of the American Competitiveness Act for the time they have put into this bill, and I thank my colleagues Senators Kennedy and Feinstein for their very constructive efforts as well. All of us are interested in what is best for the American economy, and what is best for American workers. I am supporting the American Competitiveness Act because I am convinced that the bill will strengthen economic opportunities for all Americans while we respond to the daunting but exciting challenges of this new high-tech age. 
Mr. President, I want to again compliment my colleague Senator Abraham for sponsoring S. 1723, the American Competitiveness Bill, which I joined as a cosponsor because I believe we need to address the issue of worker shortages in our high-tech industries. S. 1723 provides a short-term solution for the worker shortage by raising the cap for H1-B visas, thereby keeping the jobs here in the United States instead of forcing U.S. companies to move the jobs overseas. It also provides for the longer term solution of educating and training our workforce so that American workers can fill the jobs generated by this very fast growing segment of our economy. 
One provision in S. 1723, as adopted in the Manager's Amendment, specifically allows for demonstration programs to provide technical skills training for workers, including incumbent workers, by consortia of private industry councils. As the lead sponsor of this provision in the manager's Amendment I want in these remarks to particularly address the intent and meaning of the provision. 
These demonstration projects include two elements that I believe are essential to help us prepare our workforce with the skills they need for today's fast-paced economy and help update our training programs for the needs of the 21st Century. These are, first, including incumbent workers in training programs and, second, stimulating collaboration between companies to train a pool of skilled workers. 
Employees now need to update their skills continually to remain competitive. The realty is that we have a global economy and there is, more and more, a global workforce. If companies cannot find skilled workers in the United States, they will find them in another country. Realistically, we must include workers who have jobs now in training programs to upgrade and update their skills so they can qualify for the changing needs of industry, instead of waiting until they lose their job or become dislocated workers from a declining industry. 
The demonstration projects described in the Manager's Amendment to S. 1723 would allow the Secretary of Labor to award grants to consortia, made up of a number of companies in the same region, educational institutions, labor organizations, state and local governments, and private industry councils established under section 102 of the Job Training Partnership Act, or successor entities. These consortia would develop training programs for technical skills needed by a number of companies in that region. Only with industry leading the skills training can we be sure that workers are being trained for jobs that actually exist. That is why the provision in this bill as amended by the Manager's Amendment creates an industry-driven training program. 
Why does this new provision indicate the federal government needs to be involved? Because industry does not normally cooperate in training workers. Small companies, and 90% of firms in the United States are small businesses, don't have the resources to invest in lengthy training. Larger companies used to provide training programs, but in the high-tech field, workers move quickly from one job to another chasing higher salaries. Many companies are reticent to invest in long-term training for employees that may quickly move on. Cooperation within an industry provides a solution to this program. This program is intended to specifically allow participation by small and medium-sized companies. The new provision in the manager's Amendment to S. 1723 would enable this approach. 
The government's role under this new provision would be to provide the catalyst to bring the companies together to cooperate on training. The federal funds that would be available under this new provision should be matched by funds from the consortium. The Secretary of Labor would have the discretion to undertake this implementation approach. Of course, available federal funds are meant only to start the process--federal funding would end over time after which the consortia would continue the cooperative training programs alone. 
In the last few years, a small number of regional and industry-based training alliances in the United States have emerged, usually in partnership with state and local governments and technical colleges, that exemplify the type of program on which this provision in the Manager's Amendment is modeled. In Rhode Island, with help from the state's Human Resource Investment Council, plastics firms developed a skills alliance. The Wisconsin Regional Training Partnership, metal-working firms in conjunction with the AFL-CIO, set up a teaching factory to train workers. Without some kind of support, such as created by the new provision in this bill, to create alliances, small- and medium-sized firms just don't have the time or resources to collaborate on training. In fact, almost all the existing regional skills alliances report that they would not have been able to get off the ground without an independent, staff entity to operate the alliance. Widespread and timely deployment of these kinds of partnerships is simply not likely to happen without the incentives established by a federal initiative, which would be created by this provision. This provision can help create successful models and templates that others can replicate across the nation. 
I am very appreciative that Senator Abraham has included the technical skills training provision in the manager's amendment to S. 1723.

Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the fiscal year 1999 defense authorization bill. 
I do want to add my own voice to those who have offered thanks and praise to the leadership of our committee, the distinguished chairman, the Senator from South Carolina, the Senator from Michigan, who have worked together as chairman and ranking member to do exactly what Senator Coats said earlier, which is to build a strong, bipartisan--in many ways, nonpartisan--effort to meet the defense national security needs of our country. 
We used to say, and sometimes we are still able to, that partisanship stops at the Nation's borders, at the water's edge, when we enter foreign policy, defense policy. It could also be said in good measure that partisanship stops when we enter the rooms of the Senate Armed Services Committee. I thank the leadership of this committee for making that possible. 
I want to pay particular tribute to Senator Thurmond, who is an American institution, a figure that looms large in our history, who, as we all know from personal service with him, manages to do what they used to say only about wine, which is that he gets better as he adds years. He is not only informed and experienced and committed; the truth is, he is a great patriot. In so many ways that will never be visible, his leadership has strengthened the security of the United States of America in the world. It has been a great honor to get to know him at this stage of his career, to work with him, particularly on the Armed Services Committee, to thank him on this historic occasion as he manages the last of these armed services bills through the Senate. 
The nation is in his debt, deep debt. I think all of us who have served with him are very proud that we have. 
This is a person who, in the hurly-burly and sometimes mean-spirited world of politics, never seems to have anything but a positive word to say--certainly, toward his colleagues. In addition to all of the substance that I have talked about, that notion of spirit is one that I deeply appreciate. 
Mr. President, while we are talking about members of the committee, I do want to thank Senator Coats, the Senator from Indiana, for the remarkable statement he has just made--eloquent, thoughtful, informed. He has made a tremendous contribution on this committee. It has been a real pleasure to work with him on a host of issues. In our case, it almost seems that I don't have to say `across party lines,' because we never thought about that; we were focused on common interests. 
We got interested in this business of the military transformation when we were both invited, on the same day, to a day-long seminar that a think tank in town was holding on national security. We spoke at different times during the day. We had not talked to each other about the fact that we were on the same program, and we both essentially gave the same speech about the challenges facing our military--that in a world where we have faced a remarkable range of challenges, post-cold war revolution, technology, and fiscal resources constraint we had to begin to think about how to stay with it and produce the most cost-effective defense we could. From that coincidence, we began to work together on some of the elements of this authorization bill that Senator Coats has spoken of and which I will get back to in a moment. I wanted to thank him, while he was on the floor, for his tremendous contributions, and in a personal way, thank him for the partnership that we have had, which has also become a friendship. I hate to see him leave; I am going to miss him, and the Senate will miss him. I know that wherever he is, by his nature, he will be involved in public service. I wish him Godspeed in that work. 
Mr. President, I rise to support the bill before us because I believe it is a very responsible bill. It is a bill that adequately provides for our Armed Forces, which is our constitutional responsibility, fully in accord with our duty of raising Armed Forces to protect our Nation. After all, it is one of the primary responsibilities that motivates people to form governments, and I think this bill continues to carry out that responsibility, uphold that duty in a way that is measured and as best we could do under the circumstances. It has never been easy to make the choices that are necessary to make when one deals with national security. I would say, having been honored to be part of this process on the committee, that it has been even harder than normal this time, because we have been working with very severe fiscal constraints. 
Senator Coats made the important point--one that I think is little appreciated here in Congress and, more broadly, around the country--that as we have worked very hard to bring our Federal Government books into balance, the real contributor to that balance in reduced spending has been the defense side of the budget. That is the fact. Sometimes people look at the amount of money we are authorizing and appropriating for national security and say, `You folks don't understand that the cold war is over.' Believe me, we understand, and the programs have been constricted, have been in some ways squeezed, and even strangled occasionally to live within the constraints, to give 
what we have been asked to give to help in this great effort that is now successfully achieved--to balance our budget. 
Lets talk specifically. By my reckoning, this is the 14th straight year in which our defense authorization and the spending to follow has declined in real dollars. We are spending a smaller percentage of our gross domestic product on defense today than at any time since prior to the beginning of the Second World War. I know the cold war is over, but the reality is that the world not only remains an unsettled and dangerous place--as we have seen in the last few days with the nuclear explosions in India--but that our military, in many ways, is operating at a more intense and faster up-tempo than it did during the cold war. And the limitation on funding that we have imposed on ourselves has made it difficult to do all that we need to do, has made it difficult to provide for our personnel as we want to provide for them, and has put us in a position to push them at a very intense level, leading some to leave. 
As is well known, Mr. President, the Air Force particularly is seeing a significant departure of pilots. They have invested a lot of money in training, pushing them at a very hard pace, and more and more of them are just reaching the conclusion that, well, I love my country, I love to serve, I have been trained to do this, I love being a pilot for the U.S. military, but my family can only take so much; it is time to leave and get a much higher-paying job in commercial airlines and have more time with my family. 
So this steady constriction of our spending on the military has had an affect on us. This budget is 1.1 percent below the rate of inflation. The budget that we put before you, the authorization bill, S. 2057, is 1.1 percent below the rate of inflation. That means more pressure to get more out of what is being provided. It is having an affect. 
Let me describe one area I am particularly interested in, because I have had the privilege of serving as the ranking Democrat on the Subcommittee of Armed Services on Acquisition and Technology. It is a pleasure to serve with the Senator from Pennsylvania, Mr. Santorum, who has done a superb job as chairman of the subcommittee. There are no partisan differences here. We both agree that there is a dangerous trend in our investment in science and technology. It has often been said, but it bears repeating, that we are some distance from the great victory we achieved in Desert Storm and the Gulf war. The remarkable technologically and sophisticated weapons system that so dominated the enemy in that war didn't just spring out of nowhere a year or two before the war; they are the result of investments in science and technology that occurred in the 1970s, which came to maturation in the 1980s, which produced the systems and the equipment that we used so successfully in the early 1990s in Operation Desert Storm. 
The Department of Defense's science and technology budget has three basic elements: basic research, applied research, and advanced technology development. The total science and technology budget, comprised of these components just mentioned, has declined from $9.5 billion in fiscal year 1993 to $7.7 billion last year, and to somewhat over $7.1 billion this year. These are the investments we are making in the brilliant ideas that lead to the remarkable weapons systems that we are going to need in the future to defend ourselves. 
No business would do this. Today, in fact, private business, understanding how important innovation and knowledge are, are investing more and more. The best businesses constantly reinvest in basic research technology and creative development. This is an alarming trend, and I point it out on the floor here this morning with the hope that we will see it, come to understand, and turn it around. I am encouraged to believe that my colleague from New Mexico, Senator Bingaman, will, at some point, be offering an amendment to this bill, 
if not a freestanding bill, which would set some higher standards and goals for increasing our support of the science and technology aspect of the defense budget. 
Incidentally, Mr. President, there is a bright story to be told here. The investments we make in defense technologies have produced enormous benefits for civilian and commercial technology, and for our world, our economy. Most people, if you ask them what the most exciting technological development of recent years is, would say personal computers, the Internet--the unprecedented ability we have to communicate with each other and the people around the world to gain knowledge rapidly. 
The Internet is the result of investments that the Defense Department--DARPA, the research agency--made years ago for its own original military uses. Then it spun off and become the Internet. You could mention one after another of the remarkable developments that make our lives more exciting and make it easier to be educated but in effect make us safer but healthier. They came from science and technology budgets of the DOD. We cut that. We are again down from $9.5 billion in 1993 to almost $7.2 billion in 1999, the next fiscal year. That is a problem. We are all going to pay for it. 
Mr. President, overall when we look at the various factors that create the environment for security and international security, when we look at the effect that these technological changes are having in creating what the experts call a revolution in military affairs, we can do things we could never do before. Commanders are able to see the entire battlefield before them in real time, not only on the battlefield. We have the ability now to send a picture of real time back to somebody at a base, or even at the Pentagon thousands of miles away from the battlefield, to see what is happening and sight the enemy. We have the ability to strike an enemy from standoff positions, exposing our own personnel to no danger, with remarkable accuracy. And it is changing constantly. 
So we have the revolution in military affairs. We have the global changes that are occurring: The end of the cold war; breakouts in some places of nationalistic and ethnic rivalries; and the spread of technology so that nations that are less wealthy than we are can focus their energy into, unfortunately, lower priced means of not only defense but offense--weapons of mass destruction, chemical, biological, and nuclear; the means to deliver those weapons with the unprecedented ability from standoff positions and with great accuracy. 
Ballistic missiles: I voted yesterday for cloture on the measure introduced by the Senator from Mississippi, Senator Cochran, and the Senator from Hawaii, Senator Inouye, on the policy of creating a national missile defense and stating that clearly here in the Senate. I didn't agree with every provision of the bill. To me, it is an urgent national problem that deserved our debate. When we got to it, I was going to prepare some amendments. I hope eventually we do get to it and we can have an agreement across not only the aisles here but between the Congress and the administration to state clearly that the development of a national missile defense is a national priority and here is the way we ought to go at it. 
Incidentally, when we go at it, we ought to begin to negotiate it with our friends in Russia about how it affects the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, not to do it by way of surprise or antagonism. But the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty was negotiated and signed more than a quarter of a century ago. The 
world is a very different place. In many ways, the strategic interests of Russia and the United States are comparable certainly on this ground: Common concerns about being affected by the spread of technology and ballistic missiles delivering weapons of mass destruction. 
So put that together--revolution of military affairs, global changes--and add to that the fiscal restraints that I have described, and you have a tough situation, one that falls on us here in Congress and on those who serve our Nation in uniform and as civilian leaders in the Pentagon, to not accept the status quo, to stick with it. Everything is changing. You can't succeed and stay static, stay the way you have been doing. You have to keep moving. You have to keep looking for better ways for doing what you are doing. You have to keep looking for efficiencies and finding ways to save money so you can use that money to invest in other areas that help you with your future defense. 
There is a great company headquartered in the State of Connecticut. Awhile back, I was reading in one of our newspapers that they were about to achieve record profits in a quarter, that they were going to go well over a couple of billion dollars on an annual basis, I believe, in profits. What is the story? The CEO of the company is calling in all of the division heads and pushing them for how they are going to find new efficiencies in the company--What are the market opportunities of the future? What are their competitors going to be doing?--knowing that, as great as things are now, unless they keep asking those questions, they are not going to stay on top 5 years from now or 10 years from now. 
That is exactly the way I think we have to approach our national security. We are the strongest nation in the world; unrivaled. Yet the world is changing. We have to keep focusing on those changes. 
General Shalikashvili a while ago, when he was Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, informed us and warned us about what we call--as Senator Coats mentioned today--`asymmetric warfare.' Yes, we are the superpower, but a much lesser power, much less wealthy, less technically developed, smaller military can focus its investment of funds into an area where they see some vulnerability in us, asymmetric, and strike at that vulnerability--perhaps our capacity to forward deploy our troops, perhaps using weapons of mass destruction, chemical warfare; or, noting how dependent we are now on space-based assets for navigation, for surveillance, targeting, for communications, perhaps to try to develop systems that would focus on that dependence and try to incapacitate some of those systems, hurting us in a conflict. 
So we have to look at that wide range of threats and protecting our assets in space, developing our ability to defend against weapons of mass destruction delivered by ballistic missiles. 
That is why we have to continue to find within a budget that is going to be constrained--I don't see in the near future, certainly barring the kind of international crisis that none of us wants, hope and pray never occurs, a great public support, a support here in Congress, for the kinds of increases in our military spending that we truly need. 
So we are going to have to squeeze more out of the rock. That means tough questions. It means, in my opinion, that we are going to have to go back and do another look at our infrastructure. It is controversial; I understand. But all of the statistics tell us that we have more infrastructure than we need, that we have reduced our personnel and other expenditures much more than we have reduced the spending we are doing on our bases. We have to come back to that and acknowledge that maybe we have to find a better way to do it, but somehow we have to do it because we need that money. As I say, we have to continue the work we have done on acquisition reform as a way to find more funds for these programs that we need to support. 
It is in this context that I come to two amendments that are in this bill, in which I think we have, as a committee and hopefully now as a full Senate, stepped up to our responsibility to oversee the transformation of our military to the future course that will not only protect our security better in the 21st century but will do it in a more cost-effective fashion. 
There are two provisions in this bill that I think are very important for our execution of this oversight responsibility. I want to speak about them. The first supports the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, our current chairman, General Shelton--doing a superb job--in his decision to establish a joint experimentation process. The second requires on a regular basis a Quadrennial Defense Review and a National Defense Panel assessment be done every 4 years--the experience we have been through in the last couple of years not to be a one-time experience but it continue on. 
Let me talk about the first. And, again, I see this not only as a move to jointness, not only as a way to better take advantage of the revolution of military affairs, but to be more efficient. We have developed a force service. They are remarkable centers of excellence and purpose, patriotism, but no one would want to diminish the unique contributions each one of them makes; and yet there are redundancies and we have to find ways while preserving the uniqueness of each service--and the special edge that some of that competition among them brings--to also bring them together more in joint requirements, joint experimentation because our premise is--and the experts tell us this, the National Defense Panel told us this--that more and more war fighting of the future will be joint war fighting. 
During the 1980s it became clear that we needed to change the way our military was organized, with more joint planning, more joint conduct of military operations. The Congress of the United States in that period of time stepped up to the responsibility when, frankly, the Pentagon would not and responded with the Goldwater-Nichols act, which I would say that most everybody today in Congress and outside says was right and necessary. 
The collapse of the Soviet Union and the unprecedented explosion of technological advances that could fundamentally redefine military threats and military capabilities in the future, once again, have generated the need this bill responds to to examine the suitability of our defense policies, our strategy, and our force structure to meet future American defense requirements. Several assessments have been done but the rapid pace of change, I think, outstripped the ability of these assessments to give us durable and continuing relevant answers. 
General Shalikashvili, the former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, reacted to this changing environment and published Joint Vision 2010 in May of 1996 as a basis for the transformation of our military capabilities. I think this was a brilliant and far-sighted document which embraced the improved intelligence and command and control available in the information age, and also developed the operational concepts of dominant maneuver, precision engagement, full-dimensional protection, and focused logistics to achieve the objective of the widest spectrum, full spectrum dominance in war fighting--a very important step forward. 
We in Congress have also been concerned about the shortcomings in defense policies and programs derived from some of the earlier assessments. In 1996, we passed the Military Force Structure Review Act. That act required the Secretary of Defense to complete in 1997 a Quadrennial Defense Review of our programs to include a comprehensive examination of our defense strategy, force structure, force modernization plans, infrastructure, and other elements of the defense program and 
policies with a view toward determining and expressing the defense strategy of the United States and establishing a revised defense program through the year 2005. 
That Military Force Structure Review Act of 1996 also established a National Defense Panel, a team B, a group of outside experts, many of them with active military experience, to assess the Quadrennial Defense Review and to conduct their own independent, nonpartisan review of the strategy force structure and funding required to meet anticipated threats to our security through the year 2010 and beyond--an attempt to force the process to do what our colleagues in the private sector do, try to look out beyond the horizon, make some reasoned and informed judgments as best we could about what threats we face, what competition we face, and then come back and decide where should we be investing, how should we be restructuring and reorganizing to be in the best possible position to meet those threats of the future. 
I appreciate the bipartisan, unanimous support that was given to that Military Force Structure Review Act of 1996, and I believe it resulted in two reports that have had a very important effect on our military and how we view our future needs. 
The QDR, as it is called, the Quadrenniel Defense Review, completed by the Secretary in May 1997, defined the defense strategy in terms of shape, respond and prepare now--three cardinal principles. The QDR placed greater emphasis on the need to prepare now for an uncertain future by exploiting the revolution in technology and transforming our forces toward Joint Vision 2010. It concluded that our future force will be different in character than our current force. 
Then came the National Defense Panel. Its report, published in December of 1997, concluded that `the Department of Defense should accord the highest priority to executing a transformation strategy for the U.S. military starting now.' 
Let me just repeat those words. A transformation strategy, broad, bold transformation strategy to the next era of threat and opportunity, offense and defense, and the final words `starting now.' It is timely. It is important. It recommended the establishment of a joint forces command with responsibility as the joint force integrator and provider, a center of activity to meld the services together in some joint experimentation, investments, requirements, training. 
Also, the NDP recommended that this joint forces command have the responsibility and budget for driving the transformation process of U.S. forces, including the conduct of joint experimentation. If we are not experimenting together, how are we going to really be prepared for the joint war fighting that the experts tell us will dominate the future? 
Admiral Owens, former Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said to us on many occasions to look around and note that we don't have joint bases, and that is something to think about. That may be one. 
Both of these assessments, the QDR and the NDP, provide Congress with a compelling argument that the future security environment and the military challenges we will face will be fundamentally different from today's. They also reinforce the fundamental principle, the underpinning of the Department of Defense Reorganization Act of 1986, the so-called Goldwater-Nichols act, and that fundamental principle was that warfare in all its varieties will be joint warfare requiring the execution of joint operational concepts. 
As a result of these two assessments, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Shelton, and the Senate Armed Services Committee certainly have concluded that a process of joint experimentation is required to integrate advances in technology with changes in the organizational structure of the Armed Forces and the development of joint operational concepts which will be effective against the wide range of anticipated threats, and will not just be effective, but will be cost effective because they will achieve efficiencies of scale; they will eliminate redundancies; they will pool resources for maximum results. 
It is necessary to identify and assess independent areas of joint warfare which will be key to transforming the conduct of future U.S. military operations. To do this, U.S. Armed Forces must innovatively investigate and test technologies, forces and joint operational concepts in simulation, war game and virtual settings, as well as in field environments under realistic conditions against the full range of future challenges. The Department of Defense, I am pleased to note, is committed to conducting aggressive experimentation as a key component of its transformation strategy. Service experimentation and the resultant competition of ideas is vital in this pursuit. To complement the ongoing service experimentation, it is essential that an energetic and innovative organization be established within the military and empowered to design and conduct this process of joint experimentation to develop and validate new joint warfighting concepts aimed at transforming the Armed Forces of the United States to meet the anticipated threats of the 21st century. 
Mr. President, in this regard I refer my colleagues to title XII of this defense authorization bill, S. 2057, which sets this out in the form of a sense of the Senate, in a quite detailed form and, in my opinion, quite progressively, as a result of very constructive discussion among the Senate Armed Services Committee, Secretary of Defense, and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. I think we have a blueprint here which expresses the transformation that our military is now undergoing, led by the Secretary and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and sets down a mark that is an expression of the policy desires of the Congress in this regard, that we not only appreciate that the military move in this direction; dispatching our constitutional responsibility, we urge them to do just that. And we require, here, a series of reports to tell us how they are doing. The joint experimentation provision in the bill, title XII, is our statement of support to General Shelton, as he designs and executes his plans for joint experimentation, to select a command, the Atlantic Command, presumably, to carry out this important responsibility. 
Title XII does not dictate either the method that the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs should choose nor the outcomes that he should arrive at. It is a sense of the Congress. It helps establish a framework for us to explore the options for our future security in the hard light of tests on the ground, the only place where these arguments can begin to be settled objectively and where these theories can be tested realistically. And this provision in title XII offers a mechanism for us to get a report about the process, about the results, that is detailed enough for us to provide the kind of oversight we should and must provide if we are going to make the right decisions about our national security in the coming years. 
Finally, the provision that requires a quadrennial defense review and national defense plan to be conducted every 4 years is equally important. The assessments that were conducted and the debate they have engendered within the Congress, within the inner community of active defense thinkers, and hopefully increasingly within the country, has been very useful. But the valid criticism by some, of both of these studies, and the conflicting ideas that they have raised make it obvious that a one-time assessment is not going to provide us all the answers we need. 
We also know that the world is not going to stop changing, and just as that CEO of that large private company headquartered in Connecticut that I described who, at the moment of greatest historic success, was pressing his managers to review where they were, look forward, decide what they had to do so they would stay on top, 5, 10, 15, 20 years from now--the repetition of these two reports, the QDR and the Inside the Pentagon Review, and the NDP, a nonpartisan, independent review, offer that same hope of constant reevaluation, sometimes provocation, and hopefully, some good, solid ideas. That kind of formal review of our national security posture every 4 years will permit the needed look at where we have been and what course corrections we need to make without the disruption of too frequent interference, with the certainty that we will not slide into destructive or unproductive or irrelevant paths because we simply haven't stopped to look at what we are doing and where it is taking us. 
Mr. President, I thank the Chair, I thank my colleagues. Bottom line, this is a balanced bill, the best I think this committee could offer the Senate, Congress, and the Nation, to protect our national security in a time of restraint on resources that is greater than I think is really in our national interest. But we have done the best we could. Again, I thank the leadership of the committee for the purposive, cooperative and informed way they have led us through the exercise that has produced this bill. 
I yield the floor. 
If there is no one else on the floor seeking recognition, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce, along with Senators Bingaman and Santorum, the National Defense Science and Technology Investment Act of 1998. I have been concerned for some time now that our investments in defense R&D are not commensurate with the opportunity that new technology developments afford. I recognize, Mr. President, that relative to the procurement budget, defense R&D has fared well in recent years. While the ratio of R&D funding relative to procurement was an appropriate benchmark during the Cold War, I would argue that it is a misleading indicator in the current environment. 
We find ourselves in a comparatively peaceful historical interlude in which we face no peer military competitors. How likely is it that this set of circumstances will last? We don't know the answer to that question. The future is uncertain and, if history is our guide, will be considerably more dangerous than today. At the same time, the ongoing technology revolution is creating revolutionary new capabilities that will change the nature of warfare itself. These new capabilities would enable our forces to engage an enemy in a coordinated fashion across an entire theater of operations and thereby rapidly and totally dominate the battlespace. By aggressively exploiting the new capabilities that technology has to offer, the U.S. can assure its decisive military superiority over any potential adversary, even with numerically smaller forces than are fielded today. Our ability to realize this vision of the future, however, depends on the research and development we conduct today. 
All of the assessments, both internal and external, of our nation's defense posture concur that we must transform our force structure through greatly accelerated rates of technology insertion. The transformed military force envisioned in, for example, General Shalikashvili's Joint Vision 2010 requires a much higher level of research, development, prototyping, and testing than we are engaged in today. Our current defense R&D budgets simply don't support the accelerated rates of technology insertion and integration that these assessments imply. 
Mr. President, I realize that our military has many needs today that compete for scarce defense dollars. But we cannot mortgage our future security to short-term demands. Increased funding for our nation's defense R&D enterprise is essential if we are to realize the vision of a transformed force structure that takes advantage of the new opportunities that the high-tech revolution has to offer. The National Defense Science and Technology Investment Act of 1998 would put us on the path of higher defense R&D budgets by outlining a plan for real increases of 16% over ten years. This is a modest proposal, Mr. President, and one that holds the promise of very significant future returns. I urge my colleagues to join Senator Bingaman, Santorum, and me and support this important piece of legislation.

Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to say a few brief words of support for the bill we are now considering, the Securities Litigation Uniform Standards Act of 1998. I was an original co-sponsor of this important legislation. Through its passage, we in Congress can continue to send the strong message to the nation's securities markets and the country's investors that we first articulated in 1995 with the enactment of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act: we will not let frivolous lawsuits disrupt our nation's securities markets, devalue our citizens' investments or cut off the free flow of information we all need to make reasoned and well-informed investment decisions. 
I was a proud supporter of the 1995 Act, which restored some rationality and common sense to the laws regulating federal securities litigation. That bill set specific standards for federal private class actions alleging securities fraud, so that those deserving of compensation received it, while those seeking only to profit from the filing of an abusive suit did not. Unfortunately, in the wake of that Act, some enterprising plaintiffs' attorneys have turned to State courts to file abusive suits. Through these State court actions, plaintiffs' attorneys have effectively circumvented the reforms the 1995 Act put in place, reforms we in Congress overwhelmingly embraced in the 1995 Act. 
Were the regulation of nationally traded securities a matter of purely local concern, I might agree with those who see nothing wrong with this phenomenon--who argue that each State should be free to set for itself the laws governing actions in its courts. But we clearly are not dealing here with something of only local concern. To the contrary, the securities governed by this bill--and it is important to emphasize this point--are by definition trading on national exchanges. As we all know, securities traded on national exchanges are bought and sold by investors in every State, and those investors rely on information distributed on a national basis. It simply makes no sense to open those who make statements about national securities on a national basis to class actions brought under 50 separate State regulatory regimes--not if we want efficient and well-functioning securities markets, that is. In short, not only is a uniform standard appropriate in this case; it provides perhaps the quintessential example of something that should be subject to one set of standards nationwide. 
For this reason, it is not surprising that this bill has the support, not only of a significant portion of the Congress, but also of both the SEC and the Administration. As someone involved for many years in efforts to reform our nation's litigation system, I can say with confidence that the fact that both the SEC and the Administration support this bill speaks volumes to the merits of this bill. 
Let me close, Mr. President, by thanking the principal sponsors of this bill, particularly Senators Dodd, D'Amato, Gramm and Domenici. They have worked hard to accommodate all legitimate concerns raised about this bill, working particularly closely with both the SEC and the Administration, and making significant changes to the bill as it moved to the floor. I join with them in urging my colleagues to pass this important legislation today.

 Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to pay a well-deserved tribute to my dear friend Marilyn Cohen on her retirement after thirteen years as the Chairman of the Democratic Town Committee of West Hartford, Connecticut. On May 28, 1998, Marilyn will be the honored guest at the annual Harry Kleinman dinner, where Democrats from West Hartford and throughout Connecticut will have the opportunity to show their appreciation for a job well done. 
Marilyn has always been a hands-on Chairman; a tireless and dedicated leader who earned the respect and admiration of her entire community. By any measure Marilyn Cohen has been the most successful Town Chairman in the history of West Hartford. During her tenure, Democrats have enjoyed an unmatched period of success and the high degree of satisfaction of citizens with the town's administrative services serves as the best testament to Marilyn's skill as a political leader. 
Many of those individuals counseled and supported by Marilyn have found success both in and beyond West Hartford, and I am proud to be a member of that group. Marilyn served as Political Director during my first campaign for the U.S. Senate in 1988. I know for a fact that without her unwavering support and finely-tuned political acumen, I would not be a member of this esteemed Chamber today. 
Marilyn may be retiring from her position on the Town Committee, but she will never retire from this lifestyle that she loves so much. Currently, she is serving as Political Coordinator for Barbara Kennelly, the Democratic candidate for Governor of the State of Connecticut, and will no doubt provide the same high level of direction and support that has been her hallmark for so many years. I am proud to stand before my colleagues today to thank Marilyn for all that she has done and wish her continued success in the coming years.

 Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to join those in this Chamber and around the globe who have spiritually linked arms to celebrate the 50th Anniversary of the establishment of the State of Israel. I am particularly happy to see that the people of my own hometown of Stamford, Connecticut have seen fit to join in the international chorus of voices commemorating this milestone. 
After the horrors of the Holocaust, the establishment of the State of Israel represented a significant turning point. The world community denounced an endemic hatred that had led to the decimation of a people and in doing so, set the stage for the renaissance of a culture that had been without a home for nearly two thousand years. The time of tribulation had passed and Jews were, at long last, reunited with their ancestral homeland. 
Israel and the Old City of Jerusalem represent both the current state of humanity and the heights to which we can aspire. We have been taught that long ago, Israel was a gift to Abraham and his descendants, a token of thanks for his faithfulness. Since that time, Judaism, Christianity, and Islam have each governed this land and each religion has developed a spiritual stake in the land. These religions have lived in neighboring and even overlapping communities for half a century, yet peace and security have remained elusive. We have recently begun to see the first opportunities for a lasting peace. When this opportunity is fully realized, Israel will truly stand as both symbol and reality that the forces that bind us together are far greater than the forces that seek to divide us. 
The Jewish Community Center in Stamford will be holding its celebration on May 17, 1998. I am happy to join them and the millions of others who have lifted their voices in commemoration of this very important landmark.

Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I am proud to join Senator Abraham in submitting this resolution recognizing the need--indeed the obligation--for our nation to show greater tolerance towards Americans of Muslim faith. Tolerance for people of all faiths was among the founding principles of our nation. Since the early 17th Century, when the Puritans fled to America seeking the religious freedom that was denied them in England, our nation has cherished religious pluralism and ingrained in its people the value of allowing every person to worship according to the dictates of his or her own conscience. When the Framers drafted the Constitution, they saw this principle as so important, so sacrosanct, that they enshrined religious freedom not once, but twice, in the Bill of Rights' very first Amendment. Perhaps because of this constitutional mandate, or perhaps because of the resulting tolerance the First Amendment has engendered in our society, our nation has in the more than 200 years since it began become a haven for those seeking both refuge from religious persecution and a society accepting and nurturing of a pluralism in religious beliefs. 
Indeed, like millions of their coreligionists, my own grandparents came to the United States from Central and Eastern Europe early this century, in part to escape the discrimination they suffered on account of their Jewish faith and heritage. They and those of us who descended from them ultimately found an acceptance in this country that is virtually unparalleled in history. As a result of this country's continued willingness to welcome people of different faiths like my grandparents, both we and American society have been enriched. 
Unfortunately, the traditional American values of religious tolerance and acceptance thus far too often have been denied to a more recent group of arrivals and their descendants. Despite the tremendous contributions Muslim Americans are making to American society, and despite the fact that Islam shares a common origin--and common values--with America's two other predominant monotheistic religions, Americans of Islamic faith have been subjected to harassment and discrimination solely on account of their religion and heritage. This must end. It is time for us to reaffirm our commitment to religious pluralism and tolerance. It is time for us to loudly proclaim that a diversity of religious beliefs and traditions enriches rather than diminishes our society because religion--including Islam--is a great source of values and good deeds in our democracy. It is time for us to extend to our Muslim citizens in practice the promise of our nation's ideals: tolerance of and gratitude for their religious beliefs. I hope the resolution we are submitting today puts us one step closer to achieving that ideal.

Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I would like to say a few words about the Workforce Investment Partnership Act of 1997 that we are voting on today in the Senate. The Workforce Investment Partnership Act will reform vocational education, adult education and job training programs, provide more accountability within these programs, and improve delivery to our citizens. Education and training are two of the most important investments a government can make in its citizens. It is as important as ensuring the physical health of its citizens because education and training, and the robustness of a nation's industry, are primary determinants of the economic health of the country. Education and training also determine individuals' ability to reach personal goals. Providing people with quality education and training moves people off the welfare rolls, increases upward mobility, increases incomes, and provides our industry with a more skilled workforce. 
We are in the enviable situation now of having only 4.7 percent unemployment in the United States. The high-tech industry tells us it has as many as 190,000 unfilled jobs. There are jobs available. The challenge is to match the worker's skill with industry needs. There are two challenges to providing workers with the necessary skills. The first is to make sure our children coming out of school have the basic skills they need for today's workforce, and then, to realize that learning, education and training are lifelong pursuits and do not stop once you join the workforce. 
It is clear we need to do more in both these areas. A good education should be our long term goal. But, as my esteemed colleague Mr. Kennedy mentioned last week, right now we have over three million young men and women between the ages of 16 and 24 in this country who did not complete high school and are not enrolled in school. 
After interviewing a diverse group of employers and college professors, Public Agenda found profound dissatisfaction with the way public schools are preparing students. More than 60% of employers and three quarters of professors said they believe that a high school diploma is no guarantee a student has learned the basics, and nearly 7 out of 10 employers said the high school graduates they see are not ready to succeed in the workplace. These young people will need remedial education and training in order to join the workforce. 
But young people are not the only ones who need help. The program in S. 1186 focus on the unemployed, dislocated, disadvantaged and seriously underemployed whose industry may be downsizing, whose employer may be moving offshore, who lack a sufficient education, who are coming off of welfare, or who haven't kept pace with technological skills needed for today's rapidly changing workplace. To remain competitive in today's workforce, workers must be more flexible in terms of changing careers and upgrading their skills. S. 1186 recognizes the importance of lifelong learning and enables people to receive the education and training they need at any point in their life. 
This bill provides the ties between education and job readiness. It does this by consolidating dozens of narrowly focused programs and replacing the present fragmented system with an integrated workforce system. It integrates adult education and literacy instruction with occupational skill training and professional development. It integrates vocational and academic studies. Importantly, this legislation brings the business community into the process by creating industry-led policy making boards that develop strategies for a comprehensive workforce investment system in each State. Involving business is essential to ensuring that training programs are based on local employment needs and conditions. 
Another innovation of The Workforce Investment Partnership Act is that it establishes `individual training accounts' to give job-seekers more choice in selecting the type of education and training programs they want. The bill also encourages the creation of `One-Stop Customer Service' centers which provide a central resource for all job seekers, not just those that qualify for Labor Department programs, to get information on training and employment opportunities available in the local area. 
In Connecticut, we have already seen the benefits of implementing some of these changes. We are starting to implement the One-Stop Customer Service centers. We have streamlined JTPA and TANF, the welfare-to-work program. We have moved the job component of TANF from the Department of Social Services to the Labor Department where the jobs are--where it belongs. 
The Workforce Investment Partnership Act is one piece of the solution to improving our nation's workforce. We still need to improve our educational system, attract more students into the maths and sciences, and make lifelong learning and skill upgrades a part of everyone's life. America is beginning to move in this direction. President Clinton introduced the Hope Scholarship that will encourage lifelong learning. Some states and industries are beginning to cooperate to create worker training programs that serve regional industry clusters; Senator Sarbanes introduced, and I am proud to be cosponsoring, S. 2021 to stimulate this cooperation among companies to develop regional skills alliances that provide training for jobs that are waiting in the participating companies. More companies are working closely with local community colleges and universities to match academic programs with workforce needs. We need to support all these different pieces because they fit together to provide our citizens with the tools they need to not just keep up but to move ahead and realize their goals. 
I applaud the work of Senator DeWine, Senator Jeffords, Senator Kennedy, Senator Wellstone, and their staffs in drafting the Workforce Investment Partnership Act and I appreciate all the hard work that went into it. I support this worthy legislation.

Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Chair. 
If I may, I would like to take the liberty of speaking both on the previous amendment, which would have required these three nations to obtain membership in the European Union before ultimately becoming members of NATO, and this amendment as well. I think they both spring from a common core, certainly have a common effect, and the effect would be to move the goalposts, to change the rules of the NATO accession game as defined in article X of the NATO treaty, to frustrate the hopes of the people of these three nations and the other nations of Central and Eastern Europe who lived for four decades under the tyranny of Soviet communism, to say to them now that they want to voluntarily assume their place in the NATO community and more broadly in the community of free nations that we are not ready. OK, there was plenty of time in the late forties after the Second World War for Stalin and others to carve up Europe and take you in involuntarily, but now that the cold war is over, no, we didn't learn the lesson. We are going to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory. We are going to snatch the defeat of principle and security, freedom and democracy from the jaws of our victory in the cold war. 
The first amendment says to Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic, you have come this far, we have a whole procedure that we have developed. You have democratized your country. Go back a little bit. You had the courage to rise up against a powerful central government which subjugated you, which did not give you political freedom or religious freedom or economic opportunity, 
and you have achieved your independence and your freedom. You are developing a market economy and democracy and have met all the standards that have traditionally been associated with access to NATO under article X--oh, no, now you have to go to the European Union and be accepted there. 
As I said the other day, on the first day of this debate, to ask these nations to now obtain membership in the European Union before they do in NATO is not only unfair--in the sense that it moves the goalposts, it changes the rules of the game, it applies to them a standard not applied to other NATO members, four of whom are not now members of the European Union--but it puts them in a very, very difficult position. It says to them that all the effort they made is not going to be justified, and it has an effect that is extremely unfair and inequitable. It puts the cart before the horse. It says that commerce should precede the principles of freedom and security, when those principles are what the cold war was all about. It puts the cart of commerce before the sturdy horses of democracy and security. It puts the cart of the European Union before the horses of NATO. And that is not the order that is appropriate. That is why I oppose that first amendment and hope my colleagues will as well. 
Of course, both of these amendments, including this one now that asks for a 3-year moratorium, I think spring--as some of the proponents of the amendment have said--from a concern about the effect on Russia. Our Secretary of State printed an op-ed piece in the New York Times Wednesday, April 29, yesterday--Madeleine Albright. It is a brilliant piece, eloquent, right to the point. Headline: `Stop Worrying About Russia.' 
The most fundamental argument the critics have put forward is that the admission of even a single new ally from Central Europe will harm our relations with Russia. 
Secretary Albright says: 
My first response is to wonder why some people cannot discuss the future of Central Europe without immediately changing the subject to Russia. Central Europe has more than 20 countries, and 200 million people, with its own history, its own problems and its own contributions to make to our alliance. Most of these countries do not even border Russia. But their security is and always has been vital to the future of Europe as a whole. 
Mr. President, I heard my friend and colleague from New Jersey say something I find very unsettling, arguing for the pause, arguing for the earlier amendment about European Union membership first; wondering whether we were true to our pledge, as part of NATO accession under article V, to defend member states. We wouldn't make the pledge if we were not sincere about it. Of course we are prepared to defend these nations if necessary. 
I found the references to Chamberlain in the 1930s particularly--I say this respectfully--inappropriate. If there was any sincerity behind the pledge that Chamberlain made in 1939 to defend Poland from the Nazis, as was stated, the history of the 1940s might well have been different. The lessons are clear. The best way to secure peace is to remain strong. And that is what this is all about, access to NATO, a military alliance in defense of a principle. 
The Senator from New Jersey said imperial Russia has never been defeated. Who is talking about imperial Russia? We, who are supporting the extension of NATO, believe there is a new 
Russia. We don't see an imperial Russia. We believe that these new countries, adding 200,000 troops to NATO forces, will help us meet common threats from ethnic division, international conflict, in some of the emerging democracies. We have seen it in Bosnia. We see it in Kosovo today. And it will help us meet the common threats of terrorism, weapons of mass destruction, ballistic missiles, coming particularly from the south of the NATO region but perhaps from elsewhere. 
Let me go to this amendment requiring a pause, a 3-year pause. The Senator from Virginia says we ought to let some future President decide this. There is a process under article X. There is nothing inevitable about it. We are not on automatic pilot. No other nation is automatically going to be admitted to NATO. There is a process. NATO members will consider it, presidents--administrations will decide, and then always the Senate will have the option of ratifying or not ratifying accession of anyone else to this great treaty in defense of a principle. So why the pause? Presumably to reassure Russia again. But what are the effects of that? The effects of that are destructive in three regards. 
First, on the other nations of Central Europe who may dream of membership in NATO, and, on the basis of which dreams, they are acting in exactly the way we would have them act to develop their democracies and market economies. Again, I refer to the New York Times, this time Sunday, April 26.

Mr. LIEBERMAN. That article makes very clear that the goal of access to NATO, in this case of the article in particular regard to the three countries we are considering today--Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic--has moved those countries. The promise of inclusion in NATO has helped the cause of moderate government, the reporter says, during a tough period of economic and political transition. I quote Marek Matraszek, Warsaw director of the CEC Government Relations, a political consulting firm, who says:  
The promise of NATO has defused destabilizing forces from the left and right.* * * If NATO had not been offered, Poland could have been in a disastrous situation, externally and internally. 
If we now slam the door closed on the dreams of every other nation in Central and Eastern Europe to join this family of freedom, this military alliance, I fear that we will set back the onward march of freedom and a market economy for which we fought the cold war. 
Second, it will reduce the ability of NATO and the dream and goal of NATO membership to resolve conflicts that now exist among various nations in Central and Eastern Europe. The Hungarians and the Romanians, because of their desire to join NATO, settled age-old problems. Poland and Lithuania began talks about concerns they had for the same reason, to put themselves in the same position. The nations in that region have not lost sight of the reaction of NATO to the movement within Slovakia toward a less open, less free government--which is to say that Slovakia has dropped down in the chain of those who are being considered for NATO membership. 
Finally, a third consequence of imposing this pause. 
Mr. President, I note you moving toward the gavel, and I ask simply for an additional minute, if I may, from the time of the Senator from Delaware.

Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Chair. 
The final loss from imposing an arbitrary 3-year pause where none is necessary because no action is required will be on us, on the United States, on our credibility, on what we stand for, on the principles that the rest of the world now, most of it, want to emulate and aspire to. 
If we say to these other nations of Central and Eastern Europe, `Forget about it, we are more worried about Russia, we are more worried about a renaissance of imperialist Russia, we are more worried about affecting the feelings of people who may be aggressive than we are about honoring your dream and effort to achieve freedom and democracy and security,' then we will have abandoned our principles, our first principles as a country. When we do that, we lose our strength, because ultimately those principles underlie the power of America in the world community. 
Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to defeat these two amendments and to put ourselves on the right side of history. 
I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.

Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I was opposed to the amendment offered by Senator Inhofe. Quite frankly, I believe the consequences if this amendment passed would have been extremely deleterious to our foreign policy. 
Mr. President, everyone should recognize that his amendment is nothing more than a thinly-veiled threat to delay NATO enlargement and to ensure that we won't have NATO enlargement for a significant period of time. It is very clear that President Clinton can't and won't submit the Kyoto Protocol for Senate ratification until the conditions he has set are met--meaningful participation by developing countries. The Administration is not in a position of saying now when that milestone will be achieve, but it probably won't be soon. So a vote for this amendment is a vote to stop NATO expansion. 
But even if you oppose NATO expansion, you should oppose this amendment because the approach it takes is without precedent and would have a significant impact on how the country conducts foreign policy. 
Let me say also that I was a member of the Senate observer group to the Kyoto conference last December. There has never been a more complicated, difficult international negotiation attempted. I believe that the conference was a historic success: more than 160 countries recognized that the common threat of climate change was more important than each nation's separate anxiety about the immediate impact of an agreement. 
The Conference was also a historic success because American proposals won the day. We called for much more real and realistic targets and timetables. We proposed flexibility through a trading program to use the power of the market to achieve lower compliance costs for business. We offered a joint implementation system that would allow American firms to build clean power plants or preserve forests in developing countries in exchange for emission reduction credits that could be used or sold later. Our negotiators won on each of these battles--and they were very hard fought battles. 
But the President has clearly said that the Kyoto protocol is not ready to be submitted to the Senate. The President has made clear that the protocol will not be ready for submission until we have succeeded in achieving the meaningful participation of developing counties. At Kyoto, a down payment was made in the form of a `clean development mechanism' which embraces the U.S. backed concept of joint implementation with credit. This will allow companies in the developed world to invest in projects in countries in the developing world for the benefit of both parties. 
But developing countries will clearly need to do more in order to meaningfully participate in combating global warming, and in order of the President to submit the protocol for the consideration of the Senate. Secretary Albright recently announced a full court diplomatic effort to achieve this goal. 
Mr. President, as far as I can determine, there is no precedent in our history for doing essentially what this amendment seeks to do, force the President to transmit a treaty to the Senate before the President deems it appropriate to do so. This amendment is a high-handed attempt by Congress to undermine the President's constitutional power. 
Mr. President, I asked the American Law Division of the CRS to look at a related issue: whether there are any time limitations within which the President must submit a treaty after it has been negotiated and signed. Let me quote from that report: `As a general proposition, there do not appear to be any time constraints on the transmittal of treaties to the Senate for its advice and consent. The spare language of the Constitution provides simply that `(the President) shall have Power, by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate, to make Treaties, provided two-thirds of the Senators present concur. . . .' Under this structure, it is the President who negotiates and ultimately ratifies treaties, provided the Senate gives its advice and consent. But the constitutional language does not set time limits on any aspect of the process of treaty-making.' 
The report goes on to note that `nor does statutory law appear to impose any time constraints on the submission of treaties.' 
Mr. President, the memo goes on to discuss numerous cases in which treaties have not been submitted to the Senate for ratification for a long time after they were negotiated and signed. For example, the United States signed the `International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination' on September 28, 1966. Nearly 12 years passed after the United States signature before it was submitted to the Senate for its advice and consent on February 23, 1978. 
Let me read here from the memorandum's review of the Legislative Calendar for the 104th Congress: Final Edition of the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations which discloses a number of examples of significant delay is transmittal of treaties. 
A review of the Legislative Calendar for the 104th Congress: Final Edition of the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations discloses a number of additional instances of significant delays in transmittal. A bilateral treaty between the U.S. and Haiti `Concerning the Reciprocal Encouragement and Protection of Investment' was signed on December 13, 1983, but not submitted to the Senate until March 25, 1986. A treaty on `Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters' between the U.S. and Nigeria, signed on September 13, 1989, was not transmitted until April 1, 1992. A `Revised Protocol Amending the Convention Between the United States and Canada With Respect to Taxes on Income and on Capital,' originally signed on September 28, 1980, and then amended in 1983 and 1984, was finally submitted to the Senate on April 24, 1995. An extradition treaty with Belgium was signed on April 27, 1987, but not submitted until June 12, 1995; and one with Switzerland was signed on November 14, 1990, but not transmitted until June 12, 1995. The `International Convention for the Protection of New Varieties of Plants' was originally negotiated in 1961, amended in 1972, 1978, and 1991, and finally signed by the U.S. in 1991, but was not submitted to the Senate until September 5, 1995. Finally, the `Convention on the International Maritime Organization,' originally signed on March 6, 1948, was transmitted to the Senate on October 1, 1996. 
All of these examples illustrate the absence of any legally binding time constraints on the President's transmittal of treaties to the Senate. 
I hope the foregoing is responsive to your request. If we may be of additional assistance, please call on us.

Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I am a strong supporter of the treaty before us to expand NATO. I also strongly support the agreement that emerged from Kyoto, as well as the President's position that the agreement is not ripe for submittal to the Senate at this time. There is no precedent for forcing the President to submit a treaty on a timeframe established by the United States Senate before the President believes it is appropriate. But that is what this amendment seeks to do. Adopting this amendment would have been a terrible precedent for conducting our foreign policy and I believe would have stopped the treaty now pending before us.

Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to rise in support as an original cosponsor of my colleague Senator Sarbanes' bill, the Technology Skills Partnership Act of 1998. I am delighted that Senator Sarbanes has taken the initiative in developing this innovative approach to help solve one of the biggest problems this country is facing--an insufficiently skilled workforce. This bill has the bold but achievable goal of trying to change the mindset of U.S. companies in this country in favor of collaborating on training skilled workers for their industry. 
We are facing a shortage of skilled workers in this country. Estimates are as high as 190,000 unfilled jobs in the information technology industry alone. But it isn't just the high-tech industry that needs workers with high-tech skills. All industries now need workers with computer literacy, including what we might consider `lower-tech' manufacturing and services such as auto repair shops. 
In the long-term, we need to improve our students' education in the math and sciences and attract more students into these areas. Universities need to attract more college students into scientific, engineering, and technical fields. Ultimately, a large part of the responsibility will lie with industry to attract workers into these careers by creating attractive career paths and financial rewards that can compete for the best students. 
In the short term, high-tech industry would like to raise H1-B visa caps. But we need to do something more than let foreign workers fill the gap in high-tech workers that now exists. We need to train our workforce with skills that fit industry's needs today. Industry must be a large part of the solution. Only with industry leading the skills training can we be sure that workers are being trained for jobs that actually exist. That is why this bill creates an industry-drive training program. 
Why does the federal government need to be involved? Because industry does not normally cooperate in training workers. Small companies, and 90% of firms in the United States are small businesses, don't have the resources to invest in lengthy training. Larger companies used to provide training programs, but in the high-tech field, workers move quickly from one job to another chasing higher salaries. Many companies are reticent to invest in long-term training for employees that may quickly move on. Cooperation within an industry provides a solution to this problem. 
The government's role in this bill would be to provide the catalyst to bring the companies together to cooperate on training. The federal funds are matched dollar for dollar by, first, funds from the state and, second, funds from a consortium of 10 or more companies. The federal funds are meant only to start the process--federal funding ends after three years--and then the states and industry continue the cooperative training programs alone. 
Let me give you an example from my home state: Connecticut. A recent report prepared by 
Connecticut's Industry Cluster Advisory Board found that: 
 . . . the demand for skilled manufacturing workers far exceeds the number of students graduating from manufacturing programs.' There is a `negative perception of manufacturing as a career choice.' People `still think of manufacturing as a dirty, low-paying environment with no hope for advancement. Today, manufacturing is clean, and typically a computer-based environment which pays an average annual wage in the $30,000 range or more with appropriate skills and training.' 
The report continues: 
Substantial investment in training is necessary for companies to compete in this new environment. However, since most precision manufacturing companies are small businesses--of the 750 in the Hartford region only 7.4% have more than 100 employees--companies that are dependent upon their skilled workers for success are not prepared to support worker training. 
The report says further: 
While Connecticut has a wealth of public technical training resources, these traditional programs cannot meet the current demand fast enough and do not have a direct link from training to employment. 
By stimulating industry-led training, we can guarantee a direct link from training to employment that is missing is traditional public sector training programs. In addition, most public sector training programs are focused on unemployed, dislocated, or disadvantaged workers. This program is open to all workers, including incumbent workers who want to improve their skills and increase their opportunities for higher wages and advancement. Further, this program is specifically created to allow participation by small and medium-sized companies. 
In the last few years, a small number of regional and industry-based training alliances in the United States have emerged, usually in partnership with state and local governments and technical colleges. In Rhode Island, with help from the state's Human Resource Investment Council, plastics firms developed a skills alliance. The Wisconsin Regional Training Partnership, metal-working firms in conjunction with the AFL-CIO, set up a teaching factory to train workers. While some partnerships have emerged around the country, there are documented difficulties in fostering this kind of collective action without some federal backing. Without some kind of support to create alliances, small- and medium-sized firms just don't have the time or resources to collaborate with anybody on training. In fact, almost all the existing regional skills alliances report that they would not have been able to get off the ground without an independent, staffed entity to operate the alliance. Widespread and timely deployment of these kinds of partnerships is simply not likely to happen without the incentives established by a federal initiative. This can help create successful models and templates that others can replicate across the nation. 
I am proud to support the Technology Skills Partnership Act of 1998 and urge my colleagues to join me in taking this step toward an immediate, short-term solution to the shortage of skilled workers in our country.

Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Chair. 
Mr. President, the Senator from Iowa has been very generous in yielding his own time. I wanted to make a brief statement and then pose two questions on what I take to be not just hypotheticals but real life probabilities. 
I followed the discussion on a particular element of the budget, whether State Department or defense. I don't think that is right on point to what is being said here. I think the amendment of the Senator from Iowa is saying that American subsidy, as it were, of the national expenses of Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic to meet their NATO commitments should not be more than 25 percent of all assistance provided to each of those countries by all NATO members. 
Let me lead into the questions that I want to ask the Senator from Iowa. The Senator from Iowa has said that his purpose in offering this amendment is to protect the taxpayers of America from incurring a liability greater than this 25 percent; that is, 25 percent of all assistance provided to each of these three countries by all NATO members. But I am concerned that there are some consequences in his amendment, perhaps unintended, which in fact not only do not protect the taxpayers of the United States but may hurt them, and certainly may hurt their security. And I want to describe two situations and then ask the Senator from Iowa if he would respond. 
The 25 percent number is one that has some currency--no pun intended--in NATO circles about the American share. So it is not the 25 percent that I think troubles those of us who oppose this amendment. It is what the Senator from Iowa is including within the 25 percent in subsection (C) of his amendment, and I go particularly to this and I read from the amendment. 
The assistance referred to in (A)(iii) above includes (1) Foreign Military Financing under the Arms Export Control Act. 
So here is the circumstance I am concerned about being covered here. At sometime in the future--next year, 2 years, 3 years, 4 years--one of these three countries, the Czech Republic, Hungary, or Poland, decides that they, as part of their participation in NATO, their responsibility for their own defense, want to acquire certain modern military equipment systems. 
My concern is that by squeezing foreign military financing under the Arms Export Control Act--which is to say the credits that our Government gives to facilitate the sale of weapons systems by American manufacturers to foreign purchasers--we are going to block our defense companies from having a chance to compete equally with other foreign defense manufacturers to try to sell to the Czech Republic, Hungary, and Poland. 
Because the credits will be included within the 25 percent, and the effect of that will not be to protect American taxpayers, it will be to hurt American defense workers, whose products will not be able to be sold to these three countries. 
So, I ask my friend from Iowa, is it not true, if the amendment he has submitted is agreed to, that we will limit credits for foreign military sales to these three countries and therefore limit the opportunity of American defense manufacturers to sell to these three countries, meaning that they will be pushed to buy from other producers elsewhere in the world?

Mr. LIEBERMAN. I appreciate the response of the Senator from Iowa, because I do believe the response confirms my concern that one of the effects of passage of this amendment will be to apply what I consider to be an arbitrary cap--which is to say a 25 percent cap--on all American expenditures related to the assistance provided to these NATO countries. 
Here is why I am concerned about that and why it does bother me. There are two different categories of expense. One is the direct amount we are contributing--common expenses, if you will--the $400 million that the Senator from Iowa refers to, to enlarge NATO to these countries. I do not consider the credits given to facilitate the sale of American military equipment to these countries in that same category. These are not giveaways. These are, in a long-established program, quite similar to what we do through the Export-Import Bank in other areas, or OPIC in other areas, to facilitate American companies' ability to sell their products abroad, creating or sustaining more jobs for American workers here at home. 
So, my initial concerns are confirmed. I think the effect of this amendment, if adopted, would be to limit the ability of American companies to compete equally with foreign manufacturers of comparable weapons systems to sell them to these three countries, and the losers in that would be the workers in defense companies all around America. So these export credits are not giveaways. Yes, it may take the budget, the possible spending, somewhat above the $400 million, but that is a different category. The $400 million, if you will, is a grant. This is a little bit like giving a bit of a subsidy so you can sell a multiple of many times more and create jobs for American workers.

Mr. LIEBERMAN. The Senator raises a very good question. For me, at least, there is no good answer to that. That is why I say I believe that this may be an unintended consequence of the amendment that the Senator from Iowa has put forward. There is very spirited competition among the member countries of NATO in arms sales and arms purchases by NATO. 
For instance, right now there is a great issue about the Joint Stars Program, a remarkable air surveillance of ground activity system in which we had an original requirement of 19 planes; assuming that NATO would buy 6, we would pay for 13. Our military says these are extraordinarily valuable. They are going to be critical in future warfare. We have already used them in Bosnia before we thought we would have to. Our allies in NATO decided last fall that they didn't want to buy the six from us, they wanted to try to make them themselves. So there is very spirited competition that goes on among the NATO members for NATO acquisitions, let alone to other countries. 
I do want to say one word additionally on this point. The credits that are given for foreign military financing under the Arms Export Control Act are not literally spending; they are more in the form of a guarantee. I don't have the exact information before me, because I didn't realize we were going to get into this point this morning. I don't believe that the taxpayers have actually spent very much money on these credits. They are a form of a guarantee to facilitate these sales. 
Anyway, bottom line, I leave this part of the debate with a confirmed concern, which deepens my opposition to the amendment, that one of the unintended consequences--or consequences of this amendment, if it passes, would be to hamstring, to tie up, to put a cap on the ability of American companies and workers to compete with foreign companies and workers to sell these three systems that they may want to acquire in the future. 
Mr. President, I would like to go on and pose a second question to my friend from Iowa. Let me describe a different kind of fact circumstance. 
One of the reasons I am so strongly supporting the enlargement of NATO to these three countries is that it will help us--it will share our burden, to be as specific as I can. NATO, as we continue our historic mission of providing for the collective defense of the member states, will face threats, as it has both within their territories and outside. We have seen it in Bosnia. I suspect, as others do, that we will be threatened increasingly from the south of NATO, not from the east, because Russia is now our ally and our partner--Partner for Peace, as we say--in that specific program. And I am struck by what these three new members can add to NATO's military capacity. 
First off, and most explicitly, they will add 200,000 troops. And not just the troops, but I think what we will find, because these new members will have the enthusiasm of new membership, perhaps even a greater willingness to be involved in sharing the burden that would otherwise fall exclusively on the United States of America in responding to threats to the security of NATO and its member states, including our own security. 
Let me give a specific example. Hungary has been of great help to us already in Bosnia, giving us a base from which we can launch or source so much of our activity in Bosnia. But let me come to a much more specific and recent point. A short while ago, we were on the edge of military action against Iraq again, because the Iraqis wouldn't allow us, or the United Nations inspectors, access to their facilities, according to the post-gulf-war promises that they had made. And that conflict, for now--I am afraid not forever, but for now--has been avoided. But the record will show that during the period of time leading up to the possibility of military action against Iraq, these three countries--Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic--made unswervingly clear that they were prepared to stand by us. 
Let me be very blunt about this, undiplomatically blunt. 
They were much more supportive of military action against Iraq, much more willing to commit forces and materiel, much more convinced of the common threat that an uninspected Iraq posed to them, as well as to us, than some of our longest term and foremost allies in NATO. There is no secret here. The French were particularly reluctant about military activity against Iraq. 
So what I want to pose now is another fact situation. Let us say in the next half year--we all hope this does not happen, but we can feel it building in Iraq again. Mr. Butler, of UNSCOM, of the U.N. group charged with inspecting in Iraq to guarantee that weapons of mass destruction have been eliminated, has said in the last week or two that, yes, the inspectors gained access to Saddam Hussein's palaces, but as far as I interpret his statements, the Iraqis cleared out the palaces, let the inspectors in, the inspectors naturally found nothing--there was a lot of time that passed--the inspectors went out, and now the Iraqis say, `That's it. Lift the sanctions.' 
Mr. Butler, steadfast, honorable, independent, says, `Hey, we don't have affirmative proof as required under the post-gulf war agreements that the Iraqis are not developing chemical and biological weapons.' 
So let us go forward a few months, and the conflict grows, the disagreement grows, the Iraqis refuse to allow U.N. inspectors in, and we are on the edge of military conflict again, and as we hope it will not happen, in fact there is a decision to launch a military action, and in this we ask and receive the support of our allies in Hungary, Poland and the Czech Republic. 
I know I am speeding up the schedule a little bit because they will not in that timeframe have acceded to NATO membership. So let us take it forward a year or two or three. They want to help us in an international conflict. And the one in the gulf is most likely. To facilitate their aid to us, we have to invoke exactly the sections of law that the Senator from Iowa includes in his amendment under the 25-percent cap--transfers of excess defense articles under section 516 of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, emergency drawdowns of our equipment to give to them no cost leases of U.S. equipment. All of this is not to throw it away but because they can share our burden. They can send troops to be with ours. But they may need some assistance, materiel assistance that we would normally draw down from. 
So perhaps this has been a longer way than necessary to say that my concern is, these additional sections of this law would prevent the United States from, in a crisis such as the one I have described, or God forbid a larger one, where the soldiers, the military forces of these three countries were ready to share the burden of the United States in defense, in fact the 25-percent cap would say, you cannot do it, you cannot help them help us. 
That is not only in the most limited and technical sense such a result in the interest of the taxpayers of the United States, it certainly is not in the interest of the security of the United States or in the interests of the well-being of the military of the United States, without assistance from countries like this, to have to shoulder more of the burden. 
So I ask my friend from Iowa, is it not true that these sections of this amendment would limit the ability of the United States to draw down, to transfer articles, to enter into no-cost leases of U.S. equipment to these three countries in a time of crisis, in which we would very much want them to be helping us with our assistance?

Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Senator. What I am saying is that from the best estimates I have seen, the American contribution to 
the common costs of NATO will be limited to the $400 million. But there will be other cases in our self-interest, such as the ones I have mentioned, where there is an international crisis and we will want to draw down, to give no-cost leases to Hungary, Poland and the Czech Republic to help us so we incur less damage and less direct costs ourselves that I am afraid this amendment would limit. I consider that a very separate category than in the contribution we make to the common costs of NATO enlargement.

Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Senator from Iowa. I will say a brief word or two more and then yield to the Senator from Oregon. 
What I fear from the amendment is that the effect of the amendment will be to limit our ability to sell cost-effective items to these three governments, not just the ones that the Senator may consider to be bloated in expense. And more to the point of the second example that I have asked him about, I think it will have the unintended consequence of shackling us in our attempt to benefit from the willingness of these three countries to assist us in a time of international crisis. 
I want to make a final point about the comment that the Senator made in passing that this is about, the NATO enlargement debate is about principle, not about jobs in America. I respectfully, loosely paraphrase there. 
In my opinion, as I tried to indicate yesterday, this debate really is about a principle, about the principle of freedom that was secured and won in the cold war and that we now, in my opinion, have a moral obligation to ratify that victory in the freedom won by countries like Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic, countries that suffered during the cold war and the long years of Soviet Communist domination, to welcome them into this military alliance which is based on the principle of freedom, also on collective defense. 
I know that there are some who have said that what drives this debate, what drives the move for NATO enlargement is the yearning by American military contractors for more sales in Central or Eastern Europe. I must say, I am on the Armed Services Committee and I have not had a single comment--I have contact on a regular basis with representatives of defense companies, and I have not had a single one of them say a single word to me about NATO enlargement. 
But that having been said, and looking realistically, the potential sales here are quite modest as a proportion of overall military sales throughout the world, particularly within the United States with the Pentagon as the purchaser. But if these three countries want and need to purchase new military equipment, why would we want to limit the ability of American companies to sell American made products to them? So, no, the debate overall is not about American workers; it is about the principle of freedom and collective defense, and the promotion of peace and stability on the European Continent, 
which is what NATO has done so greatly for almost 50 years and will do more broadly in the years ahead if we enlarge it. 
Way down on the list of effects is the possibility that there might be a few sales of American-made equipment to these countries. I fear that the unintended consequence of this amendment would be to limit those sales and, in that sense, to give an unusual and surprising competitive advantage to military contractors abroad, particularly in Europe, perhaps even in Russia or China, as well. 
I thank my friend from Iowa for what I hope has been an illuminating dialog and for the directness and eloquence of his own participation. 
I thank my friend from Oregon for yielding me this time. I yield the floor.

Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I want to respond briefly to two points. One is on the question of the involvement of the American defense industry in this debate. The Senator from Iowa cited a news article indicating that a group called the U.S. Committee to Expand NATO, headed by a gentleman involved in the defense industry--honestly, I don't know the facts about that committee at all, but I have seen some advertisements they have placed. But what I want to do is suggest--and I know the Senator from Iowa didn't mean to say this in quoting the article--that the support for NATO enlargement is quite broad. It is enormous. It goes well beyond this one organization headed by this one man. There are a host of military and veterans' organizations that I think support this because they have learned the lessons. They feel enlarging NATO is one of the rewards, if you will, for their service over the long years of the cold war. It was one of the goals they aspired to--to free the captive nations and let them become part of the community of freedom-loving nations. AMVETS supports NATO enlargement, as do the American Legion Association, U.S. Army Jewish War Veterans, Marine Corps League, National Guard Association, Reserve Officers Association, Veterans of Foreign Wars Association, 
and, in addition, a host of civic policy and political organizations, including, interestingly, the Council of State Governments, the U.S. Conference of Mayors, a host of State legislative bodies, including my own State senate in Connecticut that spoke on behalf of enlargement; 
A true rainbow coalition of ethnic organizations, American ethnic organizations, many of whom have members who have family ties to the people who have suffered for almost five decades, four decades anyway, under Soviet Communist domination, are now thrilled that their family and friends can enjoy the blessings of liberty and want to affirm that opportunity by membership in NATO; 
Many business and labor organizations, including the AFL-CIO, support the enlargement of NATO. So this is a very broad-based organizational effort, much beyond one group; 
A remarkable number of high-level officials have signed a statement of support of NATO enlargement; former Vice Presidents Quayle and Mondale; former Secretaries of State Baker, Christopher, Eagleburger, Haig, Rodgers, Shultz, Kissinger, and Vance. I believe that is every living former Secretary of State; 
Former National Security Advisers Allen, Brzezinski, Lake, McFarland, and Powell; 
Former Secretaries of Defense Carlucci, Cheney, Clifford, Perry, and Rumsfeld. 
It is a remarkable, broad coalition, much beyond one person whose affiliation may be the defense industry and an organization that I presume is much larger than that. 
The second and final point that I want to make is I want to draw on something that the Senator from Oregon said, and it helps me to make a point about what I believe to be one of the unintended, certainly undesirable, consequences if we should adopt the Harkin amendment, which I hope we will not. The Senator from Oregon has occasionally held town meetings in Oregon. He has asked about NATO enlargement. Do we want to send your sons? How will you respond to the question of why would you send your sons to defend Budapest or Warsaw or Prague? 
One of the effects of enlarging NATO is in effect quite the opposite, which is to bring the military forces, 200,000 strong, into the common effort to defend NATO and its member states from security threats to it and them. That involves a scenario that I suggested earlier that may occur in the Middle East around Iraq and other trouble spots around the world. What I am confident of is there will be an enthusiasm and a steadfastness to participate among these three new members that we don't always find, frankly, among the other members who have been with us from the beginning. 
The question could almost be turned. That is, expanding NATO holds the prospect that Hungarian soldiers, Czech soldiers, and Polish soldiers will be sent to trouble spots in the world and not require American soldiers to be sent, certainly not in the same numbers. I believe that one of the consequences of this amendment putting an arbitrary 25 percent cap on American involvement here will be to make it impossible for us to draw down supplies and equipment to offer assistance to those soldiers of these three countries when they share our burden and place less of a burden on our military and on those who wear the American uniform. 
I thank the Chair. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Chair. 
Mr. President, I rise to support the resolution calling upon the Senate to advise and consent to the ratification of the Protocols of the North Atlantic Treaty of 1949 on the Accession of Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic. 
This is an important debate, an important week for this Chamber, for this country, for our alliance with our friends in Europe and, indeed, for global security. I appreciate very much the quality of the debate and the thoughtfulness of it as it has proceeded this afternoon. I must say that I am honored to be part of this debate and grateful to my constituents in Connecticut for giving me the chance to do so. 
It is a debate that looks backward and forward, and its significance goes in both directions. 
Looking backward in our history and in the history of Europe, it could well be said that the enlargement of NATO to now encompass these first three countries that lived under Soviet domination is a ratification of the end of the cold war. It is a validation that we have learned the lessons of that war. 
Looking forward, it is, in my opinion, and respectfully, directly at odds with those who oppose expansion and spoke earlier this afternoon, it is the best step that we can take to protect and sustain the peace and freedom that now has broken out across the European Continent. So I appreciate very much the opportunity to participate in this debate. 
Mr. President, there are three principles, three values, three ideas, three purposes that I want to speak about this afternoon in supporting NATO enlargement. They are freedom, collective defense and the promotion of peace. Each of those three, I think, speaks powerfully on behalf of the need to enlarge NATO, on the wisdom of that move. 
I want to speak particularly about freedom, because that principle may be lost in the strategic discussions and in the practical and tactical concerns that people in the circle may have about the effect of NATO enlargement. 
Freedom is at the heart of what it means to be an American. Freedom is at the heart of the American experience, and it is at the center of NATO and the NATO experience. The quest for freedom is what drove the founders of our country here, and they, in turn, were motivated by their faith, by their own quest for personal freedom and by the understanding their faith gave them that they expressed at the very outset of the Declaration of Independence, that all of us are created equal and we are blessed with certain rights--life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness--not by any assemblage of our fellow human beings, legislators, lawyers, philosophers, but we are endowed with those rights to freedom by our Creator. Freedom, the pulsating, motivating principle of the American experience, expressed in the declaration, fought for throughout our history, fought for particularly in this century in two great and terrible wars in Europe. 
After the second of those, when another threat arose to freedom in Europe from Soviet communism, the leaders of the Western European countries and the leader of the United States at that time, President Harry Truman, saw the need to come together in a military alliance, NATO, to protect what had been 
won, the freedom that had been won during the Second World War and to try to roll back the advance of tyranny and communism that had begun to occur in Europe under Soviet domination. 
That is what NATO is all about. Yes, I understand it is a military alliance, but it is a military alliance in defense of a principle, and that principle is freedom, individual human dignity and worth, as expressed in our Declaration, as I described a moment ago. 
Political freedom, religious freedom, the right to express oneself, the right to pursue one's own economic well-being without being dictated to by a central government--that is what NATO is about, a military alliance in defense of a principle. And that is what the cold war was about, not just a clash of blocs or power groupings; it was a great clash of ideas. 
Freedom against tyranny, the right of the individual against the right of the state to dictate to the individual; state-controlled economy against market economies. And freedom won, individual dignity won, market economies won. It is a remarkable story whose heroes are numberless, the soldiers in NATO who stood guard over those decades of the cold war, the proud and effective leaders of the Western democracies, the people who understood what was at risk and stood side by side in defense of these principles. 
In 1989, the Berlin Wall fell. The Soviet Union began to collapse, and the countries that lived under its domination, not just the people of Russia, among whom there are so many heroes who brought this about, but the people in the constituent countries of the former Soviet Union who had lived under tyranny, whose national identities had been temporarily erased, at least from public expression, certainly not from within their own conscience, whose right to worship as they wished had been suppressed and stifled, whose drive to better themselves by working to build a better life for their family, to profit, to achieve success was undermined, was crushed by the power of the bloated bureaucratic Communist state. 
Those people who were suddenly freed, freed by the collapse of the Soviet Union, understood what the cold war was about, understood it was about freedom and understood what NATO is about. That is why they have come to us to ask for inclusion. 
After all those years of living in effective slavery, they have turned to us and said, `By the grace of God and good leadership and faith, now we have the opportunity to express our national will, our individual selves to be free, to prosper,' and they have turned to NATO and not to the European Union, as some of my colleagues would urge them to do, because they understand what the past was about and what the future is going to be about. 
Yes, NATO is a military alliance, but it is a military alliance in defense of a principle, which is freedom, and freedom and security precede commerce. 
Of course, inclusion in the European Union is important. 
But these countries now knocking at the door of the family of freedom, asking to become members of our community of freedom, they understand the significance of NATO.

Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to offer a bipartisan resolution expressing the sense of the Senate regarding Japan's difficult current economic condition. 
I am privileged to do so on behalf of my original cosponsors, Senator Lugar, Senator Graham, Senator Brownback, Senator Bingaman, and Senator Rockefeller. 
Mr. President, for the last 46 years almost to the day--since April of 1952, when the American occupation of Japan ended and immediately our two Nations entered into a security agreement--the United States and Japan have shared the common goals of peace, stability, democracy and prosperity in the Asia-Pacific region and throughout the world. 
The fact is that Japan has been our most critical strategic ally and our most important economic partner in the region. We have worked together to bring unprecedented prosperity and security to our people's through mutual understanding and cooperation. The importance of the United States-Japan alliance was reaffirmed by President Clinton and Prime Minister Hashimoto in the April 1996 Joint Security Declaration and the United States-Japan bilateral military cooperation critical to our security in the Asia-pacific region. It was enhanced with the revision and promulgation of the United States-Japan Guidelines for Defense Cooperation in 1997. 
Japan is our second largest trading partner--not in Asia but in the world--and a huge and growing consumer of American goods and services. Japan imported $65.6 billion of American goods in 1997, third only to our neighbors to the north and south, Canada and Mexico. That figure has increased 37 percent from 1992 to 1997. In addition, Japan has played an important role in the current Asian financial crisis with financial commitments of approximately $19 billion through the International Monetary Fund, while we, as the news indicates today, have trouble coming up with a comparable amount authorized by members of Congress. 
However, the current economic crisis in Japan is real and represents a new and serious challenge to United States-Japan cooperation to achieve the common goals of economic prosperity and national security. We must not allow this extraordinary bilateral relationship to falter at this critical time, but, rather, we should do everything in our power to support the people of Japan and encourage the Government of Japan to implement new policies that will promote strong and sustained economic recovery. 
In less than a decade, Japan's economy has slowed so much that pundits have coined the phrase `passing Japan,' meaning that many in the world now look past Japan and toward its continental neighbor, China, as the economic engine for Asia. But I take these observations to be premature. Japan retains enormous long-term economic strength but, nonetheless, has some very serious immediate economic problems which cannot be ignored. Experts believe that Japan's economy will be stagnant or shrink this year; real industrial output was down 3 percent for the first 2 months of this year. Unemployment, while still low by world standards and American standards, is at approximately 3.6 percent, which is a 45-year high in Japan, in a society that, incidentally, lacks the kind of social safety nets that we have built in our country. The Nikkei Index is hovering around 15,000, near its lowest level in 10 years; bad and doubtful bank debts are estimated at an astounding $574 billion; the Asian crisis has dried up an important source of 
trade and corporate earnings for the Japanese economy--that is, the regional crisis--and the Bank of Japan's most recent Tankan survey showed Japanese business outlook for the future to be gloomy. 
At least so far, we have been fortunate that the fallout on our economy from Japan's economic woes, as well as the collapse of the other troubled Asian economies, has been minimal. That is another way of validating the enormous resilience and strength in the American economy. Nonetheless, we have had serious and real early warning signs. In the trade figures announced last week, we see evidence that Japan's economic troubles are starting to have a direct impact on us here in the United States. If Japan's economy continues to deteriorate, there is good reason to believe that it will affect our ability to create jobs and to sustain current GDP growth. 
Today, my colleagues and I introduce this resolution to express to our President and to the Government of Japan that the Congress of the United States is deeply concerned about Japan's poor economic performance and the pressure it is putting on our overall bilateral relationship. It is widely agreed among economists throughout the world, including most that I have read about in Japan, that more than a quick-fix fiscal stimulus is needed to address the underlying problems that are now being seen in the Japanese economy. 
In that regard, I was very encouraged to see that earlier today Prime Minister Hashimoto announced a more long-term approach to restoring economic growth in Japan than had previously been presented by his government. Along with the details of the Japanese Government's $123 billion stimulus package, the Prime Minister announced today that he would delay by 2 years his self-imposed deadline to balance the national budget. That is a significant change. This will provide the opportunity for Mr. Hashimoto to make his proposed income and targeted tax cuts permanent. And I believe this is the right 
policy and will help lead Japan out of its current economic troubles. 
The resolution that we submit today also calls for a number of fundamental economic reforms in Japan--deregulation of the Japanese economy, improvement of market access, and enforcement of fair trade. These are all actions which should increase the competitiveness of the Japanese markets and of Japanese companies and provide greater opportunities for investment in Japan and for the success of individual entrepreneurs within that country. 
Finally, the resolution describes the implications of the weakening Japanese yen which could lead to another round of competitive currency devaluations throughout the region. Of particular concern is the effect of the weak yen on the Chinese yuan. Further devaluation of the yen could lead to a devaluation of the yuan, an event with significant ramifications of the regional, global and, therefore, of course, American economies. 
For economic, political and strategic reasons, we must support and encourage economic reform in Japan. It is absolutely necessary. In the end, a more open and healthly Japanese economy is in the interest of the Japanese and American people. The sooner Japan recovers from its economic problems, the sooner the United States, Japan, and the world will reap the benefits of a stable and growing Asian-Pacific region. 
As we express our concerns about Japan's current economic difficulties, we must also remember the very significant economic strengths that Japan has. It is the second largest economy in the world, second only to ours, and maintains enormous human and capital assets. The fact is that one of this century's most dramatic stories is Japan's rise to economic superpower status, achieved by a citizenry dedicated to education, hard work, and fiscal responsibility. Japan is the most literate society in the world, and 94 percent of the population completes high school. The Japanese save more than any other people in the world. I know some critics may argue that too much savings is not good for the economy, but the point I want to make here is that in Japan saving is a virtue, as it was for a large parts of our own history. We lost that truth for a period of time and, fortunately, we are now recovering it, saving in larger numbers again, and that is part of the reason why our economy is doing so much better today. 
Japan also maintains huge foreign reserves and continues to be a major contributor to international organizations. Unlike the United States, Japan is a net creditor nation. Simply put, Japan's potential for the 21st century continues to be very bright. Its strategic importance to the United States continues to be critical. Long into the next century, Japan will remain our economic trading partner and strategic ally, sharing our goals of regional and world prosperity and peace. 
Given the significance of the current crisis in Japan and the importance of Congress making its voice heard on this crisis, I urge my colleagues to review and hopefully support this bipartisan resolution.

Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to voice my support for the Parent and Student Savings Account PLUS Act, which I am pleased to join Senators Coverell and Torricelli in cosponsoring, and also to urge my colleagues to give this bill a full and fair hearing before making up their minds on it. 
The core of this legislation is similar to a provision that passed both houses of Congress as part of the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997, but was stricken out before the President gave his final approval. The Taxpayer Relief Act authorized the creation of an Education IRA that would allow parents to set aside up to $500 each year in a tax-free account to help pay for their children's college education, a provision that I cosponsored. Senator Coverdell succeeded in adding an amendment that would permit parents to also use this Education IRA to pay for elementary and secondary education costs, but that provision was ultimately dropped from the final version of the Taxpayer Relief Act at the request of the Administration. 
The bill we are considering today, H.R. 2646, mirrors the modifying amendment that Senator Coverdell offered. It would increase the annual contribution limit for the Education IRA up to $2,000, and then expand the definition of `qualified expenses' to also allow families to withdraw money from the account without penalty for K-12 expenses, such as tutoring, tuition, books, uniforms, computers and special services for disabled students. Like the original Education savings account, this expanded version would be targeted at the broad range of working and middle class families with dependents under 18 years old, limiting eligibility to those households with annual income of less than $160,000. 
Judging this proposal on the merits, it makes eminent sense. At a time when parents are growing increasingly concerned about the quality of K-12 education their children are receiving and when many educators are trying desperately to spur greater parental involvement in their children's schooling, the expanded Education savings account would encourage parents to invest directly in their children's education, from kindergarten all the way through to graduate school, and take a more active role in the lives of their sons and daughters. And at a time when many parents are seeking more choices for their kids, especially for the students who are trapped in failing and unresponsive local schools, this bill would help make private or parochial school a more affordable option for those families who decide that is the best choice for their child, or in some cases, the only chance to get a decent education. 
For the average family, this plan would provide a significant incentive to set aside some of their savings for the myriad costs they may face in helping their children reach their full potential, such as the after-school math tutoring an underachieving child needs to reach grade level, or the new computer a budding programmer needs to upgrade his skills, or the special classes a dyslexic students needs to take to overcome her disability, or even the price of tuition a family needs to pay to ensure that their child can learn in a safe, disciplined environment. According to an analysis by the Joint Tax Committee, if a family with annual income of $70,000 contributed the maximum each year to the expanded IRA, they would accumulate a savings of more than $17,000 by the time their first child was age seven, while saving $1,000 in taxes. By the time that same child was ready to start high school, the account would be worth $41,000, and the tax savings would top $4,300. 
Those are significant sums of money, which could be used for immediate needs when children are growing up, or in many families, could be reserved primarily to help meet the financial burden of going to college. The choice is up to each individual family on how to spend their money--which is an important point to stress, that we are talking about after-tax income, not the `government's' money, not a tax credit or even a deduction. It is the parent's money, not the government's. The modest tax benefit we are proposing would simply reward them for saving for their child's future, which is exactly why we passed the original Education savings account with strong bipartisan support. 
This is all reasonable and sensible, which leaves me puzzled as to why some are attacking this bill as if we were proposing to destroy public education in this country as we know it. Judging from the overheated rhetoric we have been hearing, this plan is little more than a backdoor attempt to funnel money into private schools at the expense of public schools and create a new tax shelter for the wealthy. It would `do 
nothing to improve teaching or learning in our public schools,' in the words of one group; instead, it would `undermine support of public education,' in the words of the another. And a third organization seethed that this bill is really `private and parochial school vouchers masquerading as tax policy.' 
For those of us who have fought the school choice battles in the past, the nature and vehemence of these criticisms is familiar. Last fall, for instance, we called for the creation of a small pilot program here in Washington, D.C., that would have authorized $7 million to provide 2,000 disadvantaged children with scholarships to attend the school of their choice, without a dime away from the amount requested by the D.C. public schools. For that Secretary of Education Richard Riley, a man I truly admire, went so far as to suggest that our bill would `undermine a 200-year American commitment to the common school.' 
But what is surprising in this case is how utterly disconnected the current criticisms are from the bill we are considering today. Let's start with the fact that this measure does not remotely resemble a voucher or scholarship plan, nor does it target aid to private schools. This is a savings account bill, one that simply raises the contribution limit for the existing education savings account and gives parents the choice to use some of those savings for K-12 expenses. It is unequivocally neutral on its face--it does not distinguish between public school parents and private school parents. It is meant to help all parents, and the truth of the matter is that the clear majority of parents who are expected to take advantage of it--70 percent, according to the Joint Tax Committee--will have their children in public schools. To suggest otherwise is to ignore the growing variety of educational costs that many public school parents face these days, and overlook the tens of thousands of parents who are turning to places like Sylvan Learning Center to help improve their children's skills. 
The critics of the education savings account legislation are also off base when they proclaim that it would do absolutely nothing to help public education. To see why, I would urge my colleagues on both sides to re-read the President's major educational priorities. Both the President and the Secretary have rightly argued that stimulating greater parental involvement is critical to reaching all seven of the Administration's top goals, particularly when it comes to improving reading proficiency. The Secretary believes it is so essential that he established a broad-based national initiative--the `Partnership for Family Involvement in Education'--to better engage parents. The bill we are debating today, H.R. 2646, will help by encouraging parents across the country to save for the future and take a more active role in their children's schooling. It will not singlehandedly raise test scores or prompt millions of new parents to join their local PTAs. But is will complement and reinforce the work that the Secretary and many national and grassroots education groups are already doing, and for that reason it is worthy of our support. 
Perhaps the most vexing criticism of this super Education IRA plan is the notion that it will only benefit the wealthy. The language of the bill explicitly refutes that point, and I would urge my colleagues to read it for themselves. They will see that it precludes any individual parent with income above $110,000 or any couple above $160,000 
from contributing to an expanded IRA. I would also urge my colleagues to refer again to the Joint Tax Committee's analysis of the bill, which projects that 70 percent of the tax benefit from the expanded IRA will go to families with annual incomes less than $75,000--middle class families. And I would urge them to consider the provision in the bill that allows any corporation, union, or non-profit organizations to contribute to IRAs for low-income students. The growth of donations to private scholarship funds across the country--more than $40 million has been raised since 1991 for programs in more than 30 cities, including one in Bridgeport, Connecticut--suggests that there are many generous groups who would be interested in lending their support to an Education IRS for a disadvantaged child. 
Mr. President, in making these points, I harbor no illusions. I recognize that a relatively small number of poor families will likely benefit from the expanded IRAs, and that these accounts will primarily help middle and upper middle class families who have the means to maintain them. But that is a significant chunk of our populace, and most of them are financially stressed in trying to meet the costs of home, family and school. If this bill can spur them to invest in their children's education and generate parental involvement, then it will serve a valuable purpose. 
Moreover, I would also say to my colleagues that if they truly want to target aid to disadvantaged children who are not being well-served by the status quo, then they should support legislation that Senator Coats and I have sponsored that would establish low-income school choice programs in several major cities. These pilot programs would give thousands of poor students the opportunity to attend a better school and realize their hopes of better future, while providing us as policy-makers an opportunity to examine what impact this kind of narrowly-targeted, means-tested approach would and could have on the broader education system. Many of the supporters of the bill we are debating today also have expressed strong support for the Coats-Lieberman bill, so it's just not accurate to suggest that the sponsors of the education savings account legislation are merely interest in helping the well-off. 
Nevertheless, the opponents of this bill continue to insist that we are wrong no matter what the facts say. Last year, many of my Democratic colleagues and many of the leading educational groups voiced their strong support for the original Education IRA as a boon to middle class families struggling to pay for college. Today they turn around and attack the same concept with the same income caps--let me repeat, the same exact income caps--as a sop to the rich. The difference, of course, is that parents would have the choice to use the savings from the expanded IRA for K-12 expenses for public and private schools students, or college or both. 
That distinction is so significant to our cities that they are willing to eliminate the part of the A+ Accounts bill that would increase the contribution limit for the IRA from $500 to $2000, which would give millions of parents an even greater incentive to save for college, in order to prevent us from providing a modicum of relief for elementary and secondary costs. That facet of the bill has gotten lost in all the hyperbole of this debate, and it bears repeating: Beyond allowing parents to use the IRA to pay for K-12 expenses, this measure would significantly enhance their ability to meet the burden of paying for college. In fact, according to the Joint Tax Committee, the clear majority of the additional $1.64 billion in tax benefit that this bill would extend over the next 10 years would go to families who are saving for higher education, a very important purpose for them and for our country in this education age. That is something that the critics of this super Education IRA are reluctant to acknowledge. According to them, practically every last penny from this bill will end up in the coffers of private elementary and secondary schools. On the contrary, most of the money saved will go to colleges and universities. 
Hearing these misdirected attacks, I can't help but ask why so many thoughtful, well-intentioned educational groups are engaging in so many logical contortions to bring down this bill. To answer that question, I would repeat the simple theory I offered last fall during the rancorous debate over the D.C. scholarship bill: Love is blind even in public policy circles. I fear that our critics are so committed to the noble mission of public education that they have shut their eyes to the egregious failures in some of our public schools and insisted on defending the indefensible. And they are so conditioned to believing that any departure from the one-size-fits-all approach is the beginning of the end for public schools that they refuse to even concede the possibility that offering children a choice could give them a chance at a better life while we are working to repair and reform all of our public schools. 
In this week's debate, we are seeing this reflexive defensiveness again. We are not discussing a voucher bill. We are not attempting to give nay Federal money to private 
schools. We are proposing a modest plan to help families--not public school families, or private school families, but families of all kinds--provide the best educational opportunities for their children. It sounds a lot like the G.I. bill or the guaranteed student loan program, which we all support. But because some parents who take advantage of these accounts and the small tax benefit we are offering will choose to send their children to private schools, this bill is seen as anathema by some. 
Mr. President, as the consideration of this bill proceeds, I would appeal to my colleagues to lay down their rhetorical arms and listen--not to be bipartisan co-sponsors of the bill, but to the people we are trying to help. Yes, they want smaller class sizes, and yes, they want safer and sturdier public schools, and yes, they want better-trained teachers. But those are not reasons to oppose this bill. In addition to seeking more money to improve our public schools, parents increasingly are demanding more choices for their children--be it in the form of public school choice, charter schools, or scholarships for low-income kids to attend a quality private or parochial school. And they are seeking more of a focus on results rather than a defense of the system and all who function in it. 
Poll after poll confirms this. For the sake of this debate, let me cite just a few. A recent survey by the Center for Education Reform found that 82 percent of parents said they would support efforts to give them the option of sending their children to the public or private school of their choice. A much-quoted study done by the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies last year found that 57 percent of African-Americans and 65 percent of Hispanics favor the use of vouchers to expand opportunities for low-income students. And even Phi Beta Kappa, which is openly skeptical of private school choice, found in its annual poll on public attitudes towards public schools a slim plurality of Americans would now support a program using tax dollars to pay tuition at private school for some children. If my colleagues need any more evidence, I would point them to the mushrooming charter school movement, where parents and teachers hungry for alternatives to the status quo have started more than 700 new schools from scratch over the last five years, with hundreds more to open next fall. 
The bill we are considering today cannot and will not guarantee greater choices for every family. But it does offer a progressive response to the public's pleas for innovative educational solutions that focus less on process and more on children. That, in my mind, is what is truly at stake here in this debate. We cannot walk away from our responsibility to fix what ails our public schools, to set high standards, and demand greater accountability in meeting them. But in doing so, we must not be so defensive in our thinking that we reflexively rule out innovative options that deviate a scintilla from the prevailing orthodoxy. 
That is why I have urged my colleagues to give choice a chance. That is why I have urged this body to give charters a chance, which I am proud to report we did last year in raising Federal funding by 60 percent for this fiscal year. And that is why I am appealing to my colleagues today to give this Education IRA bill a chance. By doing so, we can prove that it is possible to encourage parents to invest in their children's future without disinvesting in our common schools. And hopefully we can begin to change the dynamic of what for too long has been a disappointingly dogmatic and unproductive debate on education policy in this country and lay the groundwork for a new bipartisan commitment to putting children first. 
Mr. President, again, this bill is part of a host of responses to a reality to, I think, all of us here in this Chamber, which is that while we have many extraordinarily positive things going on in our system of education in this country, while we have tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands, of gifted and, I would say, heroically successful teachers, while we have excellent schools--public, private, and faith-based--in our country, the fact is that the status quo in American elementary and secondary education is not working for millions of our children. 
The Senator from West Virginia, Mr. Byrd, spoke today with eloquence, with force, and with truth about the extent to which education, which has always been the way in which we have made the American dream of opportunity real for generations of our people, and which is even more necessarily so today because of the highly informational, technological age in which we live--how that ticket to a better life is being deprived to millions of our children today, who are going to school in buildings that are in shabby shape and schools that are unsafe--not only are the buildings unsafe, but it is unsafe to be there in many cases. Too often, they are taught--and I use the word advisedly--by teachers who are not prepared in the subjects that they are supposed to be teaching. Too many parents are wanting to help their children more, but they are too burdened economically to find a way to make that happen. Class sizes are too large, and professional development of teachers is not what it should be. 
Mr. President, I view this A+ Act, these A+ accounts, as one thoughtful, progressive response to that problem. It is not the solution to the problems that face American education and our children today. The fact is that there is no one answer to those problems. And the shortcoming of the debate that we have had here and the political jousting that is going on here--too much of it partisan--is that this debate is being framed as if it were a multiple-choice question on an exam for which there is only one right answer. That is not reality. There is not one right answer. The underlying bill here--the A+ accounts--is a thoughtful part of an answer. Many of the amendments offered, such as one regarding school construction, and class size, and Senator Boxer's on after-school education, are all part of the solution. And there are other decent, constructive, thoughtful answers to the crisis. 
I hope we can find a way--and I hope it is after we pass this bill, which I strongly support--to put aside the jousting and figure out a way to sit down together and find common ground that is aimed at benefiting the millions of schoolchildren in this country who are not being adequately educated today. That is going to require all sides to drop some of the orthodoxies, to drop some of the prejudices, to drop some of the political reflex instincts at work here today, and to go forward not to develop issues for the next campaign but to develop programs for the next school year for our children. That is the way I approach this legislation. 
This is similar to a provision that passed both Houses of Congress as part of the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 but was stricken out before the President gave his final approval. The Taxpayer Relief Act did authorize the creation of an education savings account that would allow parents to set aside up to $500 each year in an after-tax account to help pay their children's college education--a provision that I was proud to have cosponsored. The income limits in that proposal were exactly the same as in the proposal before us today. 
That proposal enjoyed broad bipartisan support. No one called it a sop to the rich at that point, because it certainly was not. It was a helping hand to middle class families who are trying to send their kids to college to better educate them and to figure out how to do it without putting an enormous financial burden of debt on their backs. 
Senator Coverdell and Senator Torricelli have had the imagination to simply take that idea and increase the amount of money that could be put in up to $2,000, and make it, as the debate has made clear, applicable to elementary and secondary education as well as college, and to make it available for use by parents for both public school students and for students of those parents who choose to send them to private or faith-based schools. 
This bill could be called `the private GI bill.' It is really, in principle, no different than the GI bill that is one of the great accomplishments of the American Government in the postwar period. I say `private' because the money isn't governmental, the money is the parents'. It is the families' own money that they put into the accounts. Then they decide how they want to use it to benefit their child's education and to put their child on a path to self-sufficiency in this technological information age. 
Some people talk about this bill as if it were the beginning and the end for public education. How could that be so? This is the beginning of an assist to parents of working middle class families, to encourage them to save some money so that they can help us better educate their children. Our priority in this country has been and always will be public education. That is where most of our children will be educated. That is where most of our effort must be put. But the crisis that plagues too many of our schools today forces us to focus on results. What are the results of the education system? What are we getting for the money we are putting into it and not on protecting the status quo? 
I view this not as a revolutionary proposal. Not at all. It is a modest, thoughtful, progressive, cost-efficient way to help parents better educate their children. Let's not forget that one of the elements of the administration's education program is to get parents more involved in their children's education. 
I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to reread the President's major education priorities. Both the President and the Secretary of Education have rightfully argued that stimulating greater parental involvement is critical to reaching all seven of the administration's very worthy, right on target, top education goals, particularly when it comes to improving reading proficiency. The Secretary believes it is so essential that he established a broad-based national initiative, a partnership for family involvement in education to better engage parents. 
The bill we are debating today I am convinced will help by encouraging parents across the country to save for the future and to take a more active role in their children's schooling. It will not singlehandedly raise test scores or prompt millions of new parents to join their local PTA. But it will complement and reinforce the work of the Secretary of Education, the great work that he and many national and grassroots education groups are already doing. For that reason alone, to encourage more parental involvement in our children's education, I think this proposal is worthy of support. 
Mr. President, as I see you in the Chair, the Senator from Indiana, it reminds me to make this point. Some have said that this bill is a sop to the rich because of the income limits. In my opinion, it is a helping hand to the middle class working families. The reality is that the poorest families in our country probably will not have the money. I hope they can find some to put into these tax-free education savings accounts. 
But I appeal to my colleagues. If you really want to help give a boost to poor children, if you are looking for a program that targets aid to those who are most disadvantaged, please take another look at the low-income school scholarship choice programs that the Senator from Indiana and I have tried in vain to convince 60 of our colleagues, 58 besides ourselves, to support so we could at least give these programs a test. Those programs are totally means tested. There is no sop to the rich there--not even a helping hand. It is to the middle class and directed totally to the poorest of our citizens. 
Mr. President, let me make two final points. I listened very carefully to my colleague and friend, the distinguished Senator from California, who is troubled by at least two of the amendments that have been put forward, both of which I voted against, one by the Senator from Washington and the other by the Senator from Missouri. Her decision, which I respect, is to vote against this bill because of those amendments. 
My decision, because of my strong support for the underlying bill, the idea of these empowering education savings accounts, is to vote for the bill with the amendments, although I oppose the amendments, but to appeal to all of our colleagues who will sit on the conference committee on this measure to 
remove those amendments, to bring them back on another day, so that they do not jeopardize the enormous accomplishment that we can make by passing the underlying bill. 
I want to say specifically with regard to Senator Gorton's amendment on block grants that he spent a lot of time on it and he did a lot of good work. It is a very thoughtful proposal. It is significantly improved--if I could use that judgmental term at least in my frame of reference--from the last time he presented it to the Senate. I know he has met with education groups about it. But the reality is, in my opinion, that it is too large a change. The underlying bill, that is significant, as I have said, is not revolutionary. Senator Gorton's amendment is revolutionary. I think appropriately it ought not to be passed after a brief debate as an amendment to another bill; it ought to be considered in the fullest of time next year, when the Congress will take up the reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. 
The final point is this: I hope beyond the effort to take these controversial amendments off, which are guaranteed to bring a Presidential veto, that the conferees will break out of the tug-of-war mode that the two sides are in and see if we can't find common ground. I have great respect for the Senator from Georgia, whose imagination built on the education savings account, the bill we passed last year, and made it into this excellent A+ account proposal. I know he has not spent the time which he has, as well as Senator Torricelli and others, just to pass a bill that is vetoed by the President and nothing happens. I know him well enough to know that he is not looking--if I may speak directly--for an issue, he is looking for an accomplishment, as all of us are.

Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Senator. 
My appeal is that when this bill passes, as I am convinced it will, that the conference committee, or meetings outside the conference meeting, including representatives of both parties, both Chambers, and the administration, sit down together and see if we can't put a package together that includes these education savings accounts, the A+ accounts, and opens the door and includes some of the proposals that have been made by some of my Democratic colleagues in this debate and are favored by the administration. 
I think that is the way to have the result of all of this debate this week to be more than noise and issues to carry into the campaign. That is the way to have this debate result in some real change, some real hope of reform in America's educational system, and, most specifically and in a more personal way, some real hope for a better future for the millions of children in America who are not being given that chance for proficiency because we are not giving them the educational tools they deserve. 
I thank the Chair. I thank the Senator from Georgia. 
I yield the floor.

 Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, at more than two centuries and counting, America is a nation ever maturing with greater wisdom, experience, morality and humanity. For this we can thank many of our most senior citizens who continue to set proud examples of daily life, and who remind us of our rich and proud heritage as a nation of caring individuals. Leo Lakin of Gardner, Massachusetts--who will turn 100 years old on May 26th--is one such American. 
Millions of our friends and neighbors distinguish themselves every day as parents, small business owners, educators, and in every other personal dimension and chosen profession of American life. There are those, however, who stand out as role models for their families and their communities. Leo wears these titles effortlessly and modestly, which is one reason why our Secretary of Labor Alexis Herman, our Secretary of Health and Human Services Donna Shalala, and Green Thumb, Inc. honored Leo as `an outstanding older worker' at the first Prime Time Awards Dinner on March 12, 1998 in Washington, DC. 
Praise of Leo has been both modest and inspirational. In her nominating letter to Green Thumb, Inc., Marcia Hopper of Gardner's downtown association wrote that `Mr. Lakin's work ethic of kindness, compassion, generosity, and thoughtfulness to customers has brought him a loyal following based on both business and friendship. Many of his current customers are fourth generation.' Pete Trudel, another long-time business owner in Gardner, said of Leo, `He's intelligent and knowledgeable. He has always kept up with the latest business trends. He's personable and loves people. He always remains calm. He's just a lovely, lovely man.' 
Leo Lakin was born in Boston on May 26, 1898. The Lakin family moved to Southbridge, Massachusetts when Leo was a small child. Leo became bilingual as he grew up, as the French American community in Southbridge was large, and speaking French served Leo and his family well. His father, Phillip, was able to develop deep roots into the community. Philip Lakin became known for more than owning a dry goods store. He was always helping some less fortunate person with food, clothing or a place to stay. That strong sense of community became part of Leo's life, just as a strong sense of family had been instilled in Leo from a very early age. 
Leo and his 4 brothers--Celec, Louis, Eddy and Bob--were extremely close to each other. Phillip had been a widower with 5 children when he married a young widow, Annie, who had a daughter, Sarah. Leo idolized his parents. When he was about 11 years of age, he overheard his parents speaking in Yiddish, expressing the hope that some day after their passing one of their sons would be sufficiently well versed in Jewish tradition to be able to say the Mourner's Kaddish to honor and respect their memories. Overhearing this conversation had an enormous impact on Leo's life. He promised himself that he would honor his parents in this way, and the study of Hebrew and Jewish tradition was a vital aspect of Leo's youth. He has spent many, many years helping to conduct synagogue services and enjoying the richness of Jewish studies. 
Leo left high school after his freshman year and went to work for the American Optical Company, one of the largest lens manufacturers in the world at that time. His career there began as so many do in America, with a summer job. Leo stayed for several years but eventually he longed for the freedom he could experience as an entrepreneur. In 1922 he and his brother Eddy opened Lakin's Brothers, a men's store located in Gardner's Webster Square. In 1933, relatives in Fall River introduced him to Ida Gollis, a personal shopper at the Outlet Company in Providence, Rhode Island. They married on June 2, 1935. To this day, Leo says, `She's the best thing that has ever happened to me.' 
In 1935, children's specialty stores were en vogue. Gardner was a virtual boom town known as `The Chair City of the World.' Heywood Wakefield, Gem Crib and Cradle, Nichols and Stone, Florence Stove, and Simplex Time Recorder called Gardner home. Two weeks after their marriage, Leo and Ida opened Lakin's Children's Shop. And just like Leo's dad had done, they observed an important ethic of treating their customers with the respect and kindness, never pressured a purchase, and made everyone feel welcome. 
For the next 51 years, Leo and Ida survived every challenge from the Great Depression to the rise of shopping malls and the demise of many small downtowns. Only Ida's death in June of 1986 ended that partnership on this earth. Leo continued to run the store, and his customers remained loyal and supportive. The store has remained the cornerstone of Leo's vitality, and a force that will not be beaten. In March of 1993, Leo broke his arm at work and recovered. In February of 1994, he contracted pneumonia and recovered. That July, he broke his hip at work, had a replacement at the age of 96, made a complete recovery, and returned to work 6 days a week. 
During the 6 months of Leo's recuperation from hip surgery, his daughter Phyllis ran the store for him knowing that Leo needed the promise of returning to work in order to recover. She worked full time at Harvard Medical School, but with the help of close friends Jean Johnson, Beverly Black, and Claudette Jackowski, Phyllis kept the spirit of Lakin's alive in mind, body and soul as Leo had always done: with their customers in mind. Phyllis has since decided that the family legacy of her father and grandfather will go on, and that eventually she will carry on the tradition her parents began in 1935. `As long as I'm alive, Lakin's is alive!' she says. 
Leo broke his leg on Nov 3, 1997, which was why he could not attend the Prime Time awards in the Capital this March. Leo has been a tireless and courageous patient, continually amazes old and new friends alike, touches all with his faith, optimism, and kindness, and plans to return to the work and people he loves so much. 
Mr. President, we often wonder what America and the world we live in will be like in the 21st Century. We wonder about our children and the values they are learning today in school, at home, on television, and from each other. We can only hope that as they navigate so many diverse and dynamic forces in their lives that there will also be a Leo Lakin or two to give them a sense of history, community, family, and hope for the future as he has most certainly given to all who know and love him in Gardner, Massachusetts.

Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to note the passing of another milestone by our esteemed Vice President and my good friend, Al Gore. On March 31, the Vice President celebrated his fiftieth birthday--in excellent humor and high spirits, I might add. Welcome to the `Over 50' club, Mr. Vice President. 
The passage of half a century of life is not a milestone everyone likes to celebrate. I know, having passed my fiftieth six years ago. But then again, I understand my colleague Senator Thurmond sent the Vice President a birthday greeting in which Senator Thurmond pointed out that he was running for president when Al Gore was born. Senator Thurmond will celebrate his 98th birthday in December. 
Al Gore has always been a man of exceptional accomplishment and character. His sense of wonder and enthusiasm for life is just as palpable today as it was years ago when we first met. There's no doubt he has been one of the most effective Vice Presidents in the history of our nation and I have no doubt he will be equally as effective in whatever future endeavors he chooses to pursue. I look forward to the 21st century knowing the Vice President will be leading us there.

Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Sense of the Senate Amendment to double federal R&D investments over the next ten years. Federal support for research and development is all about creating wealth and opportunity and assuring a higher quality of life for our citizens. As policy makers, it is worth our while to focus on wealth creation because it enables everything else we want to do. 
We have an awful lot of data these days that tell us there is a firm connection between R&D expenditures and subsequent economic growth. One commonly cited figure--derived from Dr. Robert Solow's Nobel prize-winning research--is that 50% of America's post-World War II growth can be attributed to technological innovation--innovation largely driven by the discoveries that flow out of the nation's R&D laboratories. Economists do not give us the tools to determine the optimum level of R&D spending, but is clear from all the data that we are far, far below the point of diminishing returns. Numerous studies indicate that the marginal rates of return on publicly-financed R&D investments are extraordinarily high. These high rates of return tell us that federal R&D expenditures are an especially efficient investment vehicle, that we are currently underinvesting in R&D, and that we are underutilizing our nation's existing R&D infrastructure, including its pool of talented scientist and engineers. 
Why is the government involved in research in the first place? These days industry funds nearly twice as much R&D as government does, why don't we let them do all of it? The problem with that notion is that the private sector, for the most part, does not fund discovery--government does. The private sector funds the later phases of the innovation process--those phases closest to product development. Privately-financed R&D--which is mostly D--provides the critical link between research and the subsequent creation of new wealth and opportunity. It is vitally important, but it depends on publicly-financed R&D for fundamental knowledge creation. 
The benefits of knowledge created in the nation's laboratories and universities are diffuse and typically yield economic returns only after a 
significant time lag--a time lag well beyond the planning horizon of most commercial firms. Moreover, the benefits cannot be anticipated in advance. The chemists and physical scientists who first conceived of utilizing nuclear magnetic resonance to determine chemical structure never imagined that their discovery would become the basis of a whole new medical diagnostic industry. Firms realize that they cannot capture most of the benefits of fundamental research. It is a classic market failure. The returns are very significant, however, and they are fully captured by the society as a whole. 
Because federal investments are typically focused on the early phases of the innovation process, they exert tremendous leverage. This is part of the reason why the returns on federal R&D investments are so high. The early phases are the high-risk, high-payoff phases. There may be many misses, but the hits are very large indeed. 
In recent years, we have not maintained federal R&D investments at traditional levels as a fraction of either discretionary spending or, more significantly, as a fraction of national income. I would argue that, in a society and an economy that are increasingly knowledge-intensive, we ought to be increasing our investments in knowledge creation not reducing them. Nonetheless, federal support for research and development has declined substantially since the 1960s as a percentage of national income. We have to turn this situation around. Robust federal support for R&D and the American research enterprise is one of the key elements in sustaining high levels of economic growth in the future. We cannot take America's current economic and technical leadership for granted. If we are to maintain our nation's leadership position, we must be prepared to make the requisite investments in our R&D system--the most productive system of its kind in the world.

Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to rise today to introduce the Airplane Emergency Locator Act. This important legislation would require most small aircraft to have emergency locator transmitters. A similar bill was introduced in the House by Representative Christopher Shays. 
On Tuesday December 24, 1996 a Learjet with Pilot Johan Schwartz, 31, of Westport, Connecticut and Patrick Hayes, 30, of Clinton, Connecticut lost contact with the control tower at the Lebanon, New Hampshire airport. The crash occurred in poor weather and after an aborted landing. Despite efforts by the federal government, New Hampshire state and local authorities, and Connecticut authorities, extremely well organized ground searches failed to locate the two gentlemen or the airplane. The thick pines of the NH countryside have hampered the effort. This plane did not have an emergency locator transmitter, a device which could have made a difference in saving the lives of these two men. 
The legislation I am introducing today is straightforward--the only aircraft that would be exempt from having emergency locator transmitter's would be planes used by manufacturers in development exercises and agricultural planes used to spread chemicals over crops. It is my strong belief that these devices will play a vital role in search efforts, where timing is so critical in any rescue mission.

Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise to join my distinguished colleague, Senator Nickles, the assistant majority leader, and my esteemed colleagues Senators Kempthorne, Mack, Hutchinson, Craig, and DeWine as a co-sponsor of The International Religious Freedom Act of 1998. 
Freedom of religion is a bedrock principle for the American people, a cherished right that lies at the very foundation of our country. It is appropriate, and it is right, that we as Americans express our concern about abuses of that freedom as a cornerstone of our foreign policy. This is not a concern that is unique to Americans, for the freedom of religion is explicitly recognized by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Sadly, and tragically, that recognition has not served to prevent the assault on believers of a variety of religions simply for seeking to follow their faith. 
We must not be silent. The International Religious Freedom Act of 1998 is a serious, thoughtful, and comprehensive approach to the problem of religious persecution. This bill employs a broad range of tools within the United States foreign policy apparatus for the most flexible, appropriate, and enduring response to violations of religious liberty. 
The bill is carefully crafted to do the following: promote religious freedom through both incentives and sanctions, with the long-term goal of alleviating religious persecution rather than merely punishing governments; build on principles contained in U.S. and international human rights law, on negotiating principles of U.S. Trade law, and on ideas advocated by religious and human rights leaders; dispel the option of silence, with its Annual Report publicly addressing all forms of religious persecution; promote the conclusion of binding agreements with offending governments to cease the violations, allowing for reasonable negotiation to achieve this goal; and sanction gross violators, through an annual review and sanctions process. 
The issue of religious persecution is one that we must be concerned about, one that we must take action on. The International Religious freedom Act of 1998 is an effective means of doing so and I am honored to be an original co-sponsor of it. There are other excellent approaches to this critical international problem, including the legislation cosponsored by Congressman Wolf and Senator Spector. In the weeks ahead we will look forward to working with all of our colleagues on this issue, inviting and welcoming a collective approach that will result in our bringing the most effective legislation to pass.

Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I had come to the floor to speak very briefly on the amendment, now withdrawn, that had been offered by the Senator from Texas. 
Mr. President, I thank the Chair and my colleagues. Briefly, I wish to speak on the amendment offered by the Senator from Texas and the one that has been referred to by the Senator from Wisconsin about our Bosnia policy. 
A discussion was offered by the Senator from West Virginia about the power of the purse, and that is a power that we, of course, continue to have. We have, by explicit and implicit expressions, consented to and supported the policy that we are following in Bosnia. It is a successful policy. We will return to these discussions, as these two amendments suggest, before this year is ended. 
When it comes to discussing the power of the purse and the relations between the President and Congress on this matter of Bosnia policy, I simply wanted to say that I will be recorded as being in favor of the current course of our policy. It has worked. To set a date to create an exit strategy other than the one that is there now, which is the accomplishment of the Dayton process, would be to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory, or more colloquially, as our distinguished former majority leader Bob Dole has said, to impose an exit date now on our Bosnia policy, to cut off funding would be `like a football team leaving the field in the second half when they are ahead of the game.' 
Remarkable progress has been made in Bosnia, thanks to the presence of the NATO troops and, most particularly, our American presence there to end the war, to begin to rebuild a civil society. Even in the Serbian section there is new hope with new leadership from President Plasic and Prime Minister Dodik. We have proven that the reasonable exercise that diplomacy matched with force can end conflict and genocide in Europe. 
Now, that is a remarkable accomplishment. I would hate to see us jeopardize it by congressional termination of the funding or by artificially setting an exit date, or even an exit strategy, short of the accomplishment of the goals of the Dayton process. I thank my colleagues for giving me this opportunity. 
I yield the floor. 
Several Senators addressed the Chair.

Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I am very pleased today to join with my colleagues, including Senators Specter and Rockefeller, the Chairman and Ranking Member of the Veterans Affairs Committee, and the Chairman of the Armed Services Committee, Senator Thurmond, as an original cosponsor of this legislation which would authorize access to priority medical care for veterans treated with nasopharyngeal radium irradiation. Enactment of this legislation would be a major step forward for our veterans who received this treatment for inner-air problems between l940 and l960. I applaud the Clinton Administration for submitting this legislation. 
Mr. President, nasal radium irradiation was the largest scale radiation experiment in the United States and the consequences of exposing so many people to ionizing radiation has not been adequately addressed. It was used to alleviate pressure changes associated with submarine and flying duties for our soldiers and to treat children with inner ear problems. We have a moral obligation to do everything we can to help these veterans and civilians. This legislation is especially important to me because veterans who received this treatment included Navy submariners trained in Connecticut. I've been working for the last four years to get similar legislation enacted. 
Under this bill, veterans who received nasopharyngeal radium treatments will receive the same status as other atomic veterans who served in the occupational forces in Nagasaki and Hiroshima or were present at the test sites in Nevada and the Pacific. What this means is that these veterans will be able to enroll in the ionizing radiation registry which entitles them to a full and complete physical examination. They will also gain access to medical care to treat cancerous conditions detected during this examination that are associated with exposure to ionizing radiation. 
Studies that have analyzed the health effects of external irradiation of the head and neck indicate that there is an increased risk of tumours of the brain and of the thyroid, salivary and parathyroid glands. 
Mr. President, I've been working on many aspects of this problem for a number of years. I've been very concerned about notifying veterans who received this treatment so that they are aware of the concerns about the long term effects of such treatment and can take appropriate actions. Last September, the Veterans Administration agreed to provide such notification where they had the information available. The Veterans Administration is also considering performing a health surveillance involving about 400 veterans whose names were discovered in a logbook in April l996 at the Submarine School Museum in Connecticut. This would also be a significant step forward. 
I also remain very concerned about our civilians who have been exposed to this treatment. The Center for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that between 500,000 and two million civilians received this treatment between 1945 and l960. I was very pleased that CDC hosted a video conference on the treatment at Yale in September l995 and has published notices in medical bulletins about the treatment, including fact sheets for the general public. 
My number one priority on the civilian side now is attempting to ensure that civilians who received the treatment are notified. I have written to Secretary Shalala asking her to undertake a feasibility study about providing notice. People need to know that they had this treatment so that they can determine appropriate next steps, and our government should do everything possible to ensure that notice is provided. 
Mr. President, many challenges remain as the government seeks to fulfill its moral obligation to our veterans. But enactment of this legislation would be an extremely important step forward.

Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Chair, and my friend and colleague from Delaware. He and others, including the Senator 
from Minnesota, have just finished, and my friend and senior colleague from Connecticut, who is the lead cosponsor of this, has spoken quite eloquently. I really in a sense say amen to what they have said, and will add a few words: First, pride that we have put together a bipartisan resolution here with original cosponsors: Senator Nickles, Senator Dodd, Senator Biden, Senator Helms, myself, and Senator Levin. 
This speaks volumes about the facts that we have learned. We have learned most recently from the lessons of Bosnian history--the concern, the inaction, the failure to be willing to use force early--that you wonder about whether the application of even diplomatic strength that was clear and resolute would draw a reaction, and, as a result in part, a lot of people suffered, a lot of people died, a lot of bloodshed occurred, and a wider war in Europe was threatened. 
When we finally acted--NATO acted--particularly through the air in 1995, the Serbians, who were portrayed as a monster, as an army difficult to contend with in response to the application of force by NATO from the air in 1995, basically found their way to Dayton, and the peace process began. That has led to a much better state. We have learned. We are acting quickly here. 
We are building on statements made by former President George Bush, the so-called `Christmas statement,' in which he stated quite clearly the vital national interest that the United States has in maintaining peace and stability in Kosovo--that fear being, of course, if we let that go, if we let the Serbian minority continue to suppress the Albanian majority, we will not only have been untrue to our own American principles of freedom and self-determination but that we will have turned our back on a situation that is bound to explode. A people will not long continue to accept the suppression that the minority has visited on the majority in Kosovo without striking back--weakly in some ways against a superior force but resolutely, because that yearning for freedom exists within the hearts of people everywhere, and certainly in the hearts of the Albanians in Kosovo. 
That is exactly what is happening now. The fear that President Bush expressed, which is a fear that has been shared across both branches of our Government and both parties, is that a conflict in Kosovo, which is inevitable under the current circumstances, will lead to a wider conflict in Europe, and once again the Balkans will be the match that lights a fire that none of us want to see occur. 
That is why the exercise of leadership by the contact groups--Secretary Albright has been very strong, and very purposeful in this regard--here refreshingly after the unhappy experiences we had in the recent crisis in Iraq, we stand side by side with all of our major allies in NATO, and with Russia apparently in urging more than that; in expressing our willingness to impose sanctions on the Serbs, if they do not cease the suppression of the human rights of the Albanian people; if they do not come to the peace table. 
With this concurrent resolution, the U.S. Senate has the opportunity, which I am confident we will take soon today, to express quite clearly: One, that we condemn the Serbian Government in the strongest possible terms for the gross human rights violations against its citizens, including the indiscriminate use of Serbian paramilitary police units against the Albanian population of Kosovo. 
This is one of those stories that has not been widely told. But the Albanian people in Kosovo have been subject to persistent, not just discrimination but tyrannical exercise of power to deprive them of their own self-expression, of their own cultural expression, to some extent even of their own religious expression. 
We condemn terrorist actions by any groups or any individuals in Kosovo. We urge the international community to respond affirmatively to the call of the contact group for the imposition of broad sanctions against Serbia if it fails to prevent additional atrocities. And we call on our own Government to freeze funds of the Governments of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and Serbia if they do not comply by March 25, 1998, with the terms set forth by the contact group. 
We ask our Government to demand that the Serbian Government and the ethnic Albanian leadership and representatives of all ethnic and religious groups in Kosovo immediately begin unconditional talks to achieve a peaceful resolution to the conflict in Kosovo and to provide for the exercise of legitimate civil and political rights of all people there. 
Then we demand that the international human rights monitors, especially from the Red Cross, who were forced to withdraw from Kosovo be allowed to return immediately in order to be able to report to the world on human rights violations there. 
This is a strong, unambivalent statement not just of the concern about the deprivation of human rights that we in the Senate feel but of our sense of purpose about using every element of strength we have with our allies to suppress the conflict and to put the conflicted parties on the path to peace. And that peace will have to recognize the legitimate--indeed, the universal--human rights of the Albanian people of Kosovo. 
Mr. President, I was intrigued by an article I read in one of the newspapers within the last week from Belgrade which suggested that Serbian public opinion in Belgrade is not behind the policies of the current Milosevic government in Kosovo which they think will lead to war. People in Serbia have not fallen for the siren appeals to nationalism--as I believe my colleague from Delaware said, an attempt to impose a sense of greater Serbian nationalism as not just an organizing principle but a tyrannical principle to replace communism. 
The people of Serbia are like people everywhere else. They have been suffering under this leadership. Their economy is in terrible shape. Their lives are not what they want them to be. Their children have futures much darker than they would like them to be. They want there to be peace. 
I read an article written by a Serbian nationalist who said, `Kosovo is our past; it is not our future. Our future is here, to build a strong, vital, democratic, economically vibrant Serbia.' Let us hope that those voices are heard. And I think when our voices are heard in the Senate today, we will make room for those more progressive voices in Serbia and peaceful voices in Kosovo to work their will so that the conflict will be ended and self-determination will be the future. 
I thank the Chair. I thank my friend from Delaware for his continuing leadership on these and so many other matters of vital interest to our country, and I yield the floor.

Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise in support of the resolution sponsored by Senator Bond to oppose less restrictive requirements for double- and triple-trailer trucks. The resolution states that existing prohibitions and restrictions on these vehicles should be retained. 
Mr. President, there are serious safety concerns associated with the operation of bigger trucks. Because of their instability, handling difficulties, and braking problems, bigger trucks cannot stop quickly to prevent accidents and cannot be controlled safely. Bigger truck also are disproportionately responsible for expensive damage to our roads and bridges that we all must pay to repair. 
I long have opposed the operation of bigger trucks in my home state of Connecticut. Traffic in Connecticut is too congested to allow these trucks, and the geography is too varied. On I-84 west of Hartford, for example, about 105,000 vehicles each day clog the highway, and traffic steadily is getting worse. Truck accidents on this stretch of road in the last year have been a cause of public concern. The last thing citizens of Connecticut need is even bigger trucks competing with cars here and on other crowded highways. 
Common sense alone tells us that these bigger trucks are not compatible with passenger vehicles. The public overwhelmingly agrees. Opinion polls show that the public consistently has opposed legalizing the use of bigger trucks. People find these vehicles intimidating and are very aware of the hazards associated with their operation. 
Mr. President, getting into a car exposes any one of us to the chance of an accident under the best of circumstances, and we know how many Americans are injured or killed in highway accidents. We do our best to protect ourselves on the road--for example by fastening our seat belts, by obeying traffic laws, and by refusing to ride with drivers who drink. With all the other risks we face on our increasing crowded roads, we surely do not need the added hazards posed by bigger trucks. I enthusiastically support the Bond resolution for this reason. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, on March 4 the Senate voted in favor of an amendment to ISTEA that would make .08 BAC for drunk drivers the law of the land. I voted for this amendment and was an original co-sponsor of the bill introduced last year by Senators Lautenberg and DeWine to establish .08 BAC as a national standard. 
Today I stand in support of a related amendment sponsored by Senators Lautenberg and DeWine that would establish national minimum penalties for repeat drunk driving offenders. Like the .08 BAC amendment, this amendment is supported by senators from both sides of the aisle. Having agreed upon a clear and reasonable standard for drunk driving, we need to take firm steps that stop repeat offenders and that discourage others from drinking and driving. 
The terrible price we pay as a society for drunk driving warrants firm measures to address the repeat offender problem. In 1996, over 17,000 Americans lost their lives in car accidents when a driver had been drinking alcohol. These Americans died in every state and they come from all walks of life. Many thousand more Americans suffer severe injuries in alcohol-related car accidents and families are devastated. Experts tell us that repeat offenders account for a disproportionate part of these drunk driving accidents. 
This amendment provides states with necessary flexibility and a number of important tools with which to combat the repeat offender problem. It includes minimum sentencing and license revocation. It allows states to implement vehicle impoundment or restrictions on vehicle use. Punitive actions are only part of what is necessary. The amendment also provides for alcohol assessment and appropriate treatment for repeat offenders to address the underlying problems that lead to drunk driving. These carefully considered steps to fight repeat offender drunk driving need to be implemented to protect all Americans. 
Drinking and driving once is inexcusable. Drinking and driving a second or third time simply cannot be tolerated. Madam President, I support the Lautenberg and DeWine repeat offender amendment to ISTEA.

 Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with Senator Jeffords to announce the introduction of the Health Care Quest Act. Last year, he and I worked together on a bill to improve the quality of health care purchased by the federal government for Medicare, Medicaid, TRICARE, and VA beneficiaries. The Health Care Quest Act extends our effort to improve health care quality to the more than 100 million beneficiaries in private sector plans. 
For millions of these individuals, passage of the bill will bring for the first time rights for external appeals when their plan denies payment for medical treatments. The appeals process will be available to any person who thinks they were wrongly denied coverage, and gives them the right of appeal to an impartial body outside the health plan with a decision guaranteed on a timely basis. A timely decision is crucial to a sick person or parent of a child with an illness and this bill sets out very specific timeliness the health plan must meet for the appeal. 
The bill guarantees reimbursement for people who go to the emergency room thinking they are sick. Without enactment, a father who goes to the emergency room because he thinks that he is having a heart attack could be left with thousands of dollars of bills. I think that we can rely on the wisdom of people to decide when they need to go to the hospital. a person with a medical emergency should not have to wait to be buzzed in to the emergency room by a managed care bureaucrat hundreds of miles away. Medical care is more serious than admitting visitors to an apartment building. 
Patients should expect physicians to recommend the best treatment options and serve as their advocates. Protections from so-called `gag clauses' were included in last year's Balance Budget Act for Medicare beneficiaries. We are extending these protections to beneficiaries of private sector plans. 
One distinctive feature of the Health Care Quest Act is its focus on empowering purchasers, providers, and consumers with useful information about their health care. At the center of this effort is a new health care quality advisory body to follow up on the good work conducted by the President's Advisory Commission. The Health Quality Council will continuously update and expand the comparative measures of quality available to drive competition based on value. If the new grievance process in the bill provides a floor under quality, the new information requirements point consumers toward the best care available. 
I would like to end with a comment on the need for quality legislation. A recent poll by the Kaiser Family Foundation and Harvard University found that close to half of Americans--48 percent--report they personally, or someone they know, have experienced problems such as lack of information, problems with access to specialists, disputes over emergency room coverage, or no recourse to external grievance procedure. 
Low-quality health care's tragic result is sobering, 34.7% children in HMO's not immunized in 1996. 1,600 unnecessary cardiac deaths occurred among 57 million HMO enrollees because a common treatment for heart attacks (beta-blockers) was not used appropriately. 1,200 breast cancers undetected resulting in 1,800 years of life that could have been saved. 
Quality is often an issue of where you get your care with wide variations at sites within easy driving distance of each other. One of the premier hospitals in Connecticut, Yale-Haven, discharges over 92% of its heart attack victims alive--despite taking sicker patients with more health problems. Other hospitals within a thirty-minute drive have survival rates as much as 10 percent lower. Yet few patients know their choice of destination may be a life-and-death decision. 
The Health Care Quest Act attacks these deadly problems. After it is enacted, a Connecticut resident with an emergency can go to a hospital armed with information, and once there expect their care to be covered by their insurer. If they have a problem they will be get an appeal. And each day they are healthy, a Health Quality Council will be working to make sure the best possible health system is there when they need it.

Mr. LIEBERMAN. 
Mr. President, I rise today to join my friend Senator Dodd in introducing legislation that is vitally important to the future of Connecticut's only national park, the Weir Farm National Historic Site. 
As my colleagues may recall, Weir Farm was the home of the great American painter J. Alden Weir, who is widely considered a leader of the American Impressionism movement of the late 19th Century. The brilliant natural beauty of Weir Farm's landscape served as the inspiration for much of Weir's art as well as the work of several other renowned Impressionists who often traveled to the farm at the time. The splendor and serenity of this place also moved Weir's descendants and other artists who later made their home at the farm to preserve much of the landscape in the pristine state that originally inspired the many painters who visited there. 
Congress sought to protect this enormously valuable piece of our national heritage when it approved legislation that Senator Dodd and I cosponsored in 1990 to make Weir Farm part of the National Park System and the first site to honor an American painter. This legislation (P.L. 101-485) authorized the Park Service to acquire 62 acres of the original Weir property along with several of the buildings that Weir lived and worked in and many of the original furnishings. The State of Connecticut strongly supported this project and helped make it possible by approving a $4.25 million bond issue to purchase the 60 acres of open space surrounding the Weir homestead. The legislation was also strongly endorsed by a coalition of 20 leading national conservation groups, including The Nature Conservancy, which owns a large preserve of open land adjacent to the park property that further enhances the park's conservation mission. 
Today, thousands of visitors who make their way to Weir Farm each year can get lost in the tranquility of the place. They can tour the studio where Weir and his successors toiled and the classic New England barn that caught the eye of many visiting artists and that was rehabilitated with a generous appropriation from Congress. But something is missing--the art itself. 
Sadly, these visitors cannot view the wonderful collection of Impressionist works that the park managers and supporters are in the process of acquiring through private donations. That is because there is simply no place to put them on the current site. The cramped historic buildings are ill-equipped to accommodate even a legitimate visitor center, let alone a museum-quality gallery. And the possibility of building an addition has rightly been ruled out of the question because it would distort the landscape and run counter to the park's mission of preserving the historic character of the property. 
The legislation we are introducing today would help fill that void and help the park fulfill another critical part of its mission, which is to reunite Weir Farm's historic landscape with the rich array of art it inspired. Specifically, our bill would authorize the Park Service to go forward with its plan to acquire a neighboring property outside the park's boundary and build a full-fledged visitor center to house the collection of privately-acquired paintings from Weir, Childe Hassam, John Twachtman and several others. A companion version of this bill is being introduced in the House today as well by Congressman Jim Maloney, who represents the district in which the park is located. 
The Park Service approved this project as part of Weir Farm's long-term General Management Plan. The Park Service has already identified an ideal 13-acre site to house the visitor center, as well as an adjacent administrative and maintenance facility that was also called for under the management plan. The owners of the targeted site are willing sellers and the Trust for Public Land--with a donation from the Weir Farm Trust, the park's private partner--has generously agreed to act as an intermediary in the purchase by putting an option on the property to prevent it from being developed. 
But for the project to go forward, Congress must first approve the acquisition and a one-time change in the park's boundary. Our legislation would do just that, providing the Park Service with the authority to acquire up to 15 additional acres and expand the park's boundary to include this new land. It 
would also raise the authorization for land acquisition included in the original Weir Farm legislation up from $1.5 million to $4 million. 
The Park Service estimates that the total cost of acquiring the property for the future visitor center will be $1.6 million. Of that total, it is expected that approximately $500,000 would come from unexpended land acquisition funds already appropriated by Congress and state and private contributions. That leaves a Federal contribution in the neighborhood of $1.1 million, which the Park Service has indicated it will request in its budget for fiscal year 2000. The projected cost of building the visitor center and the adjoining administrative/maintenance facility is $4.7 million, of which approximately half would come from private sources and the other half would come from Federal funding through the Park Service. 
This project not only has the strong support of the Park Service and the State of Connecticut but of the communities surrounding Weir Farm, which straddles the town line between Wilton and Ridgefield. A number of residents in Ridgefield, where the visitor center would be built, initially expressed concern about the impact the project could have on the neighborhood. But the park managers and the leaders of the Weir Farm Trust worked diligently to address those concerns and show the community that the visitor center would in no way threaten the pastoral nature of the area or significantly worsen traffic along the neighborhood's narrow, windy roads. 
In fact, the friends of Weir Farm showed that this plan would actually enhance the conservation goals of the park and the community. It would prevent the historic character of the Weir property from being disturbed. And the proposed visitor center site would link the park to an additional 119 acres of contiguous open space owned by the state and the Town of Ridgefield. Also, an independent study showed that the proposed visitor center would not significantly impact the flow of traffic in the neighborhood, and the Park Service is confident that this plan provides the best long-term solution for managing transportation to the park site. 
In addition to reaching out to local residents, the park managers and the Ridgefield town government collaborated closely with my office and Senator Dodd's office to help us craft the bill we are introducing today in such a way as to ensure that the natural and historic character of the site would be preserved and to ensure the town maintained control over how the property was to be developed. As a result of these efforts, both the Ridgefield Planning and Zoning Commission and the Board of Selectmen formally approved this legislation late last year. 
This was not an easy process, and I want to express my deep appreciation to Weir Farm's superintendent, Sarah Olson, and to the town leaders in Ridgefield for their cooperation and their commitment to reach a resolution that is for the good of both the community and the park. 
The visitor center we're proposing to build will help Weir Farm realize its full potential not just as a pastoral prize but as a true cultural landmark, one that will likely attract art lovers from throughout the region and hopefully the nation to see Weir's jewel and its splendid setting. 
The alternative, Mr. President, is that if this project does not move forward, we will have squandered a wonderfully unique opportunity to make Weir Farm the only place of its kind to wed art and artistic vision in this way. The Ridgefield Press and The Wilton Bulletin, the leading local newspapers, urged us not to let this opportunity slip away in a joint editorial published last year that strongly endorsed the visitor center project. `Bringing the art to Weir Farm,' the editors wrote, `has the potential to turn the site into something more than a retreat for artists and hikers--allowing an unusual cultural experience of considerable depth.' 
Senator Dodd and I would ask our colleagues to help us seize this important opportunity by supporting this legislation, which would complete the mission we started eight years ago when we agreed to make Weir Farm part of the park system.

Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise in support of the bi-partisan amendment introduced by Mr. Lautenberg and Mr. DeWine to set a national illegal blood alcohol content (BAC) limit of .08 for drivers over age 21. I am proud to be an original co-sponsor of the bill upon which this amendment is based. 
Mr. President, the drunk driving problem is a national disgrace. Its severe emotional and financial costs to society are staggering. In 1996, more than 17,000 Americans died in alcohol-related crashes. That means someone in America loses a loved one every 30 seconds to a driver who is drunk. In 1996, more than 321,000 persons were injured in crashes where police report that alcohol was present. 
When you count up the health care costs, lost work, and other economic impacts, alcohol-related crashes also add up to a monetary loss to society of more than $44 billion every year. It's not surprising that a recent survey by Allstate identified drunk driving as the #1 highway safety problem in the eyes of a majority of Americans. 
We know that the physical and mental abilities of virtually all drivers are impaired at .08. This impairment includes critical driving tasks such as vision, balance, reaction time and hearing, judgement, and the ability to concentrate. The heightened risk of a crash starts with the first drink, but rises rapidly when BAC is as high as .08. For example, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has concluded that, in single-vehicle crashes, the relative risk for drivers with a BAC between .05 and .09 is more than 11 times greater than for drivers with no alcohol in their systems. 
Although setting a minimum BAC isn't the only answer to our national drunk driving problem, it's a necessary part of the solution. Studies show that .08 actually has saved lives where it is law by deterring unsafe drinking behavior. In fact, figures show that even heavy drinkers, who account for a large number of drunk driving arrests, are less likely to get behind the wheel because of .08 laws. We also should remember that .08 makes it easier for police and courts to do their jobs--they are less likely accept excuses when faced with offenders who have BAC levels at or around .10. 
A national strategy to require driver safety measures like this one has worked before. We have seen, for example, how earlier national laws that require seat belts and mandate zero tolerance for drinking and driving under age 21 dramatically have reduced driving fatalities. More than an estimated 16,000 lives have been saved since 1975 by the 21 drink age law. It also is very important to remember that the concept of .08 is not new or radical. 15 States already have adopted .08. Many industrialized nations have even lower legal limits ranging from .02 to .08. 
Don't be misled by those who may argue that .08 laws prohibit reasonable alcohol consumption. Such is not the experience of States that have adopted this law. To be legally drunk under a .08 standard, a 170-pound male must consume four and a half drinks in an hour and on an empty stomach. That's not what I consider social drinking and that's just not the kind of behavior that most of us who drive would consider safe. 
Mr. President, we need .08 BAC as a national limit. Having one mandatory national standard doesn't permit confusion about what's safe and what's reasonable. Pedestrians, passengers, and safe drivers all need protection from drunk drivers no matter where they live.

Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, one of the great opportunities that comes with having been elected a Member of the U.S. Senate is to participate in deliberations on this great floor. Not just, may I say, the discussions and debates and votes on specific legislation, but to participate in what we call here morning business, which I have always seen as the people's forum, an opportunity to speak on events of the day, both public and, in some senses, those that are more personal. I would like to do that this morning. 
The subject involves athletics, but it also involves, I think, values. This will not be the first time that any Member of the Senate has spoken on the floor about athletics, particularly about a team in his or her own home State. But the circumstances that lead me to stand today are somewhat different. In my own home State of Connecticut, and it seems in many places across the Nation, there are discussions in newspapers, in diners, on the radio, probably around the water cooler at the office, about what happened on the UCONN women's basketball team this week. Our great coach, Geno Auriemma, coach of our No. 2 ranked University of Connecticut women's basketball team--and, I may say with some honesty and a certain amount of envy, the occupant of the chair happens to come from the State where the No. 1 team is, Tennessee. But Coach Auriemma gave a most unusual gift, as it was put, to his All-America forward, Nykesha Sales, who is also a native of the State of Connecticut. 
As is known by most, with the help of the Villanova Wildcats, who UCONN was playing on this occasion, the coaches, the referees, in fact even with the help and consent of Big East Commissioner Mike Tranghese, Coach Auriemma gave Nykesha Sales her place as an all-time leading scorer in Connecticut women's basketball history. 
That seems generous enough and positive enough, but, as my colleagues probably know, the record has been called into question. Although the box score lists those two points, they were obtained through an uncontested lay-up that required the involvement and consent, if you will, of every player on the floor of that arena and of the coaches as well. 
Three days prior to that match, that basketball game against Villanova, Nykesha Sales ruptured her Achilles' tendon, thus ending her season and, since this is her senior year, her career at the University of Connecticut, leaving her just two points short of the record as the all-time women's basketball scorer, a record that we all felt, who have watched this wonderful young woman with pride over these last years--we all knew she deserved. This was heartbreaking news, not just to her and her family but to the entire team, to the coach, to fans throughout the State and I would guess fans of college basketball everywhere. So Coach Auriemma reacted as a human being with a big heart, which he has; as a great coach as well. He went to the extra effort to arrange a way for his star player to get that game-time basket that she needed to establish her place in the University of Connecticut record books. 
Since that moment, Tuesday night of this week, Coach Auriemma has been criticized by many who say that this gift that he gave, which a lot of us feel was not just a gift but something Nykesha Sales earned over her extraordinary career at the University of Connecticut, somehow calls into question the integrity of the game, that in some way it is another form of cheating, some have said surprisingly, and that it in some way cheapens the record. 
I rise today to say to my colleagues here in the Senate that I feel quite the opposite. I think in this gesture, in this act, Coach Auriemma, the coach of the Villanova team, and all the other players on the field, have reminded us that beneath the thrill of victory and the agony of defeat with which they and we all identify, sports can provide opportunities for values to be learned and for lessons to be conveyed. Sports are a passion here in America. I yield to that passion myself. We find a way, over and over, to take personally the things that happen on courts and in stadiums around the country. The reason I think we are so attuned to these events is because of the complex web of individual dramas underneath the final score that keeps us riveted throughout the seasons and throughout the years. 
Just as teams become families among themselves when they are at their best, so do our favorite teams, in fact, become our own extended families. Former Connecticut women's basketball star, current professional basketball star Rebecca Lobo perhaps said it best about the events of this week, when she said, `if the UCONN family'--and I stress the family here--`doesn't have a problem with it, why does everyone else?' In fact, this was a University of Connecticut basketball record, a school record. 
There are obviously unforgettable moments in sports, moments when we are all left full of pride, sometimes full of despair, disappointment. We in Connecticut have had our share, like the extraordinary Tate George buzzerbeater in the 1990 NCAA tournament, the same NCAA championship that the same UCONN 
women's basketball team won in 1995. But I would say that the record that Nykesha Sales established this week joins that kind of high ranking of memorable and historic events in Connecticut sports history. It's true that Nykesha's basket may not have been the single greatest moment of her athletic prowess, nonetheless it was a remarkably profound moment of sportsmanship, of values, of team spirit, of a sense of family that these teams at their best exemplify. 
For those who would condemn or criticize a caring coach and a grateful player for doing this, I really ask you to reconsider, again, beneath the box score, the final tally, the thrill of victory or the agony of defeat, what these sports, particularly at the college level, can convey to those who participate in them. I think we have a coach here, and a player, who have exemplified the very best in their careers. Coach Auriemma displayed a level of concern and, in fact, a kind of courage in doing what he did, and it exemplifies the program that athletic director Lew Perkins has set up at the University of Connecticut, and that not only Coach Auriemma and the women's team exemplify but Coach Jim Calhoun on the men's team do as well. These are families. These two coaches are, in a way, for the sake of those families, the fathers. They practice a kind of what some may call `tough love.' They demand a lot of their players, but they also give a lot back to those players. 
There are no two more competitive coaches, no two more competitive teams; yet, underneath that, extraordinary personal relationships have developed. I always take great pride and am moved by the stories of the UCONN basketball players, men and women, when they leave the school, graduate and go on--and this, of course, is true throughout the country and important to remember--that they have a tendency to call the coaches for advice about personal decisions in their lives. So there are lessons learned here and values exemplified. Perhaps these don't receive as much attention as they should in the coverage of sports today. But, again, particularly at the college level, I think that this is ultimately what it is all about. 
In this unusual act, Coach Auriemma, and everyone else who was involved in this decision, I think, has not only done the right thing, but have reminded us that as much as we all share in the exultation of victory and the agony of defeat when it affects our team, that something else is going on which is that individual skills are being developed, that relationships are being formed, that a kind of community is being formed, that people accept responsibility for one another, and that those values--as we have seen as these players have left the University of Connecticut and so many other college programs around the country--those values, those relationships, that trust continues on beyond and after the competitive days. It leaves us, thrilled as we all are to follow our favorite teams, with lessons that are ultimately more lasting and certainly are profoundly encouraging. So, perhaps it is only sports. Maybe we all make too much of it. But I wanted to rise to the defense of a great coach, a great player, a great program, a great team, and tell them that I am proud of them. 
I would say, finally, and with all respect to the occupant of the chair, it is going to be hard for this UCONN women's basketball team to go on to the post-season competition without Nykesha Sales, who was their star. I know they are going to give it their all, and I want to say to them that no matter what happens in this NCAA post-season competition, that as far as I am concerned--and I am sure I speak for everybody in the State of Connecticut, regardless of what the results are--this team and this coach, both on the court and off, are winners. 
I thank the Chair and I believe with that and yielding of the floor, the Senate will be adjourned.

Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Chair and thank my friend from Maine, and thank her particularly along with Senator Jeffords for their extraordinary progressive action in trying to find common ground and for constituting what is now clearly a bipartisan majority of the Senate in favor of campaign finance reform. 
It may be blocked by the filibuster rules, but there is a majority here that recognizes the gravity of the challenge to America's democracy posed by the current absence of any real regulation of campaign spending in our country and campaign contributions and wants to do something about it. I support the Snowe-Jeffords proposal. I want to approach it from this point of view. 
Mr. President, we all know that beauty is in the eye of the beholder. I would say here, having listened to this debate, that the beauty of the first amendment is also clearly in the eye of the beholder because the first amendment has been used in this debate to oppose measures that are being designed to avoid evasion of laws that have been upheld as constitutional. Let me be very specific and brief. 
The law says that an individual cannot give more than $2,000 to a campaign. Some might say that is an abridgement of free speech, but it has been upheld as constitutional by the Supreme Court in Buckley. 
The law says that corporations and unions cannot contribute from their treasuries for political purposes to affect elections. Some might say that was an abridgement, a violation of their free speech, but that has been upheld as constitutional. 
But what has happened? Soft money, issue ads, which are clearly ads for or against candidates have been used to evade those clearly constitutional restrictions on contributions to political campaigns. And so we have to do something about it. It will not be a violation of the first amendment. The current ability of parties and outside groups to disguise candidate-focused electioneering ads as issue ads undermines these longstanding and important Federal elections policies. 
A study by the Annenberg Public Policy Center found that in 1996, 29 groups spent as much as $150 million on what the groups called issue ads, but which the Annenberg study leaves little doubt were mostly aimed at electing or defeating particular candidates. Mr. President, $150 million, that is approximately one-third of the total spent for all ads by all candidates. That study found that over 85 percent of those so-called issue ads mentioned a candidate by name, almost 60 percent used a candidate's picture and, worst of all, more than 40 percent of those were pure attack ads. 
Let us pass Snowe-Jeffords which is clearly constitutional and will stop these evasions of laws limiting contributions to campaigns that have been upheld as constitutional. 
I thank the Chair and yield the floor.

Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Chair, and I thank my colleague from Wisconsin. 
Mr. President, I have spent so much time on this subject in the last year that I think I can just clear my throat in 5 minutes. But I will try to do more than that, and I hope to have additional opportunities to comment as the debate goes on. 
I want to speak against the underlying proposal, the so-called Paycheck Protection Act, and in favor of the substitute McCain-Feingold proposal that is before us. The Paycheck Protection Act, very briefly, is a very disappointing response to the many problems the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee uncovered in its recently concluded investigation. In fact, I was very surprised to see my dear friend, the majority leader, say yesterday, `I have laid down a bill that embodies the most important campaign finance reform of all, paycheck protection.' 
Frankly, there is not a single problem, with all respect, looked at during our investigation in the Governmental Affairs Committee that would have been solved with the Paycheck Protection Act. `Paycheck Protection' doesn't touch foreign money, it doesn't touch the use of public buildings for fundraising, it doesn't touch the problem of unregulated and undisclosed attack ads, and it doesn't touch the abuse of tax-exempt status by tax-exempt organizations. 
In fact, the underlying bill, the Paycheck Protection Act, is a response to a problem that doesn't exist. No one is forced to join a union, and under the Beck decision, nonunion members already have an absolute right to ask for a refund of the amount they paid the union in agency fees that went to political activities of which they do not approve. Union members, for their part, voluntarily join an organization, and they express a desire to have their leadership represent them, both with management and more generally. 
If they disagree with the way in which the leadership of the union is spending that money for political or legislative purposes, they have the same right that shareholders have who are disgruntled with the activities of the leadership of a corporation. Shareholders can launch a proxy fight. Disgruntled union members can try to change the leadership of the union. There is a democratic process dramatically, intensely supervised by the Federal Government itself. 
In fact, I suggest that the Paycheck Protection Act as before us is not only a solution to a problem that doesn't exist, it is itself a problem because it is of doubtful constitutionality. This bill says to a union that before it can involve itself in political activities, before it can spend its own general treasury funds, contributed by dues-paying members, not just on political campaigns but, by definition in the underlying bill, in attempting to influence legislation, the union leadership needs the separate prior written voluntary authorization of each one of their members. 
To me, that comes close to being a prior restraint on the exercise by a labor union of the rights it receives under the First Amendment to petition our Government to attempt to influence legislation and to free association. If that is not the case, it certainly raises questions of equal protection, because there is no similar restriction put on any other organization that I know of, including particularly corporations. True, there is language in the paycheck protection bill that deals with corporations, but by not even trying to cover shareholders, it is plainly not at all equivalent to the restriction on the expenditure of union dues. 
On the other side, McCain-Feingold, with appreciation to its two cosponsors--a great example of the kind of bipartisanship that should exist around here--is a practical response to the problems that came before the Governmental Affairs Committee. The arguments against it, with all respect, are premised on this strange twist of principle that money is speech. 
I think it was my friend, the junior Senator from Georgia, who said last year, if money is speech under the Constitution, that must mean that the more money you have, the greater is your right to free speech. Is that what the Framers of the Constitution meant when they said that all of us are created equal, we have an equal right, unfettered, to petition our Government? I don't think so. Against that specious principle, money is speech, they have undercut the sacred principle of equality of access to our Government. 
So I say the soft money ban and the other limits in the McCain-Feingold proposal are constitutional. In the Buckley decision, the Court made it clear that it is constitutional to limit contributions to campaigns, and this ban on soft money is just another way to do that. 
The fact is, as Chairman Thompson of the Governmental Affairs Committee said during our proceedings, effectively, there is no campaign finance law anymore in the United States of America, and the reason why the limits on individual contributions, the prohibitions on corporate and union money that are in the law are no longer effective is mostly because of soft money.

Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation designed to prevent future occurrences of some of the more egregious campaign finance abuses that we learned of during the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee investigation into the 1996 federal election campaigns. 
What I have particularly in mind is the misuse of taxpayer money by our presidential candidates and by various tax-exempt organizations that intervened in both congressional and presidential elections in 1996. 
Over the course of its inquiry, the Governmental Affairs Committee compiled a compelling record that leaves little question our political system was subverted in 1996 by overzealous presidential campaigns working with their parties to circumvent spending limits and by independent organizations abusing the special tax status conferred upon them. At times, the campaigns and outside groups conducted their business as if the election laws were written in invisible ink. Our democratic process suffered as a result. 
My proposal focuses on two specific areas of the law whose spirit and intent were violated in 1996. They are the campaign finance statutes regarding the public financing of presidential campaigns and the tax code, as it applies to the political activity of tax-exempt organizations. 
Let me first make clear that I am a steadfast supporter of the McCain-Feingold campaign finance reform bill. I hope the ideas that I present today might be considered as supplemental to it, since they complement McCain-Feingold and fill in some of the gaps that only became apparent after our year-long Governmental Affairs Committee investigation.

Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Chair and thank my friend and senior colleague from Connecticut. I thank him for his eloquent and moving tribute to Senator Abraham A. Ribicoff whose passing yesterday we mourn on the floor of the Senate today. I would like to just add a few words to my colleague's extraordinary statement. 
Mr. President, as Senator Dodd has referred to that critical moment in the 1954 campaign of Senator Ribicoff for Governor of Connecticut, when there were expressions of bigotry, of anti-Semitism, and Senator Ribicoff at a turning point in his own career rose to challenge those whispers directly in the eloquent words that Senator Dodd has spoken in what has become known in Connecticut political lore as Abe Ribicoff's `American Dream Speech.' In the bottom line of it was Senator Ribicoff saying, `Abe Ribicoff believes in the American dream.' And indeed he did. The extraordinary life that he led that ended yesterday, after 87 years, is a testament to the vitality of the American dream. 
Mr. President, there are many other great civilizations and democracies in the world, but I must say the more that I have the opportunity to visit them the more I come back home appreciating how unique this great country of ours is, how we have created here an ethic of mutual respect, of a fairness of opportunity that has allowed people who are capable, who are willing to work hard to rise to the highest levels in our society, whether it is in the public sector, the private sector, in the arts, sports, whatever. 
In that moment of crisis, in a campaign that, if he had lost, probably his public career would have ended, Abe Ribicoff stood up and directly confronted and challenged those who did not believe in the American dream, who were prepared to stimulate an effort against him because of his religion, to say that he believed in the American dream and had confidence that the people of Connecticut did. Also, of course, they vindicated that confidence on election day. 
His father was an immigrant from Poland--Polish, Jewish--came to New Britain, CT, worked at first as a peddler, then as a factory worker, and raised a son and other distinguished members of the family who rose to extraordinary and proud heights. 
Abe Ribicoff worked for everything he achieved. He had--if I may borrow from a phrase that my colleague mentioned earlier--he had a regal quality to him. It is a remarkable thing to say, when you think of the humble origins from where he came, but it was within himself, his dignity, his intelligence, his civility, his honor and integrity that those qualities remarkably in the hurly-burly of the political life that we lead remained intact. 
He worked his way forward, ultimately graduating from the University of Chicago Law School. He came back to Connecticut and began to practice law. And very soon he went into public life.  
As Senator Dodd said, he has a record that as far as we know is unequaled in America because of the extraordinary range of offices he held--State legislator, judge, member of the U.S. House of Representatives, Governor, Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare in the Kennedy Cabinet, and then the capstone to his career, 18 extraordinarily distinguished and productive years as a U.S. Senator. 
I want to comment on a few of those periods of his life and end with a personal word. When Abe Ribicoff became Governor of the State of Connecticut, he led an administration that constituted a turning point in the history of our State and, in many ways, pointed the direction for the future of the Democratic Party. As I have been thinking over the last 24 hours of some of the accomplishments that characterized Abe Ribicoff's career, it seems to me he was a `new Democrat' before anybody thought of the term. 
In Connecticut, where the party had most of its strength in the cities, Abe Ribicoff and others--including my colleague's distinguished and beloved father, Senator Tom Dodd--reached out from the cities to the suburbs, to the smaller towns, and broadened the reach of the Democratic Party in our State. In doing so, he not only achieved personal success and paved the way for partisan success in the future throughout the State but served with the public and the public interest in Connecticut mightily. 
Abe Ribicoff as Governor was a fiscal conservative. He believed in balancing the budget. He believed in governmental reform. He focused on public safety questions such as highway safety. He never hesitated to work across party lines. During his 6 years as Governor, there were times when the Republican Party controlled one or, I believe, both Houses of the State legislature. He had a guiding principle that he adopted and articulated that carried him very well, right through the Senate years. It is what he described as the integrity of compromise. He said, in this business of politics there is nothing dishonorable and certainly not dishonest about compromising your initial position to get something done. What is the value, he would say, of holding to that initial position as strongly as you originally felt if just moving a little bit--as long as it is not against your conscience and your principles--allowed you to do something for the people. 
He had a distinguished, very popular career as Governor, winning a very close victory in 1954, then going on to win an enormous landslide in 1958. As Senator Dodd has said, he played a pivotal role, along with our State Democratic chairman, John Bailey, in the election of JFK as President, there, again, as my senior colleague has said, giving another testament to Abe Ribicoff's belief in the American dream. 
President Kennedy asked Senator Ribicoff to become a member of the Cabinet, Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare. He served there with distinction. He did some of the early work that led to the Medicare Program, which today is so critical to so many millions of Americans to provide decent health and is itself one of the reasons the average lifespan of the American people is longer today than it was before Medicare started. 
The truth is, as he said to those of us who were privileged to know him and as he said after his retirement from public life, that the year and a half as a member of the Cabinet were not the happiest years of his career. In fact, they were probably the least satisfying. He was very honest about it. He said, `I'm used to being my own man. I was Governor, I was a Member of Congress. I'm used to being my own man, instead of having to support positions that are someone else's that I really didn't support or having to oppose other positions that I really did support.' 
He served with distinction but not with pleasure and took the opportunity to run for the U.S. Senate in 1962. That, I think, was the most productive and the most satisfying time of his remarkable career. He was again ahead of his time here. He worked on subjects like environmental protection before the great burst of activity in that area occurred in the 1970s. He had a hearing and invited the mother of the environmental movement, Rachel Carson, 
after she published her book `Silent Spring,' to testify before his committee. From that testimony, he worked on pesticides and other threats to the environment and public health. He continued the work that he started at HEW and played a leading role in the passage of the Medicare Program, serving as a member of the Finance Committee. He continued the work he had done in Connecticut on highway safety and did some very important legislative work to raise the standards for automotive safety of the American people. He was a great believer in free and fair trade and a strong supporter of the kind of governmental stimulus to the private sector that creates economic growth. He was very much in that sense a person of the Senate. 
He worked very easily and comfortably across party lines. Again, remembering the integrity of compromise in a body of 100 people with a lot of strong opinions, you need people who are bridge builders, and Senator Abe Ribicoff built some extraordinary bridges that have so dramatically improved the quality of American life. 
Mr. President, if I may end on a personal note, Senator Ribicoff was for me a hero, an inspiration, and a mentor. In 1954, when he first ran for Governor, I was a kid in Stanford, CT, beginning to develop an interest in politics. I was taken by his strength, by his independence, by the way he carried himself. Because he and I shared the same religion--both members of a minority religion--I wondered how he would fare. In some sense, he tested in a most public way the faith that my own dear parents gave me that this is a great country, this is a country of opportunity; people will judge you not by how you worship but by how you work, how you conduct yourself, what you propose to do. 
Of course, in that election in 1954, the people of Connecticut vindicated Abe Ribicoff's faith, my parents' faith and in that sense gave me that faith at a critical time in my own life. 
In the 1960s, as a college student, I had the great opportunity to work for Senator Ribicoff for two summers. This is sometimes what happens to Senate interns. We end up in the field of our dreams, as it were, here in the U.S. Senate, first in 1962 on his committee, his Campaign Finance Committee, working in the State, and then in the summer of 1963 as one of his first summer interns. We developed, I don't even want to at that stage call it a friendship, but he was a mentor, he was a teacher. I learned an enormous amount from him and will forever be grateful that when a few years later, in 1970, I decided to tackle public office as a State senator, he was gutsy enough and supportive enough to endorse me. It happened to be a Democratic primary against an incumbent, so it was quite a boost for a youngster, running without previous officeholding experience, to receive the support of the distinguished U.S. Senator whom I have talked about in terms of compromise and the integrity of compromise. 
While it was true he was a moderate man in many ways, and that helped him to build the coalitions that made things happen for his constituents and for the American people, Abe Ribicoff's moderation was not a mushy vacuum moderation. It was full of principle; it was full of substance. As those of us who knew and loved him also can tell you, he was capable of leaving that moderation to go to periods of white heat when he felt strongly about something and was prepared to step out on those occasions, regardless of what the political conventions would have told him to do. The most dramatic, well-known example is the remarkable, courageous speech at the 1968 Democratic National Convention that Senator Dodd referred to. 
Abe Ribicoff was a towering figure who served with honor and great result. It is a source of great personal pride and no small amount of humility that I have the opportunity to stand here as a U.S. Senator today to express my own sadness at his passing and my own pride at the great career that he had and, finally, to offer my condolences to his beloved wife Casey, to his children Peter and Jane, to his stepson Peter, and to his six grandchildren. Your father, your grandfather, served America with great distinction and served in a way that should give hope to the millions of others out there who may be, as he did long ago, forming their own American dream. 
I yield the floor.

 Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the Junior League of Stamford-Norwalk, based in Darien, Connecticut, on their 75th anniversary. 
For 75 years the Junior League of Stamford-Norwalk has worked to promote volunteerism, develop the potential of women, and improve the community through the effective action and leadership of trained volunteers. Since Junior League of Stamford-Norwalk was founded in 1923, their members have donated more than 2.5 million volunteer hours to meeting the needs of the area towns it serves. In doing so, they have touched many lives and served innumerable members of the community with their hard work and generous spirit. Their donation of time and money has helped organizations such as the Volunteer Center, the Women's Crisis Center, Lockwood Mathews Mansion, and the Maritime Aquarium at Norwalk to better serve the people of the area. The work of the Junior League of Stamford-Norwalk over the past 75 years had made it a cornerstone of the community, and the people of Connecticut thank them for their service, dedication, and contribution to their communities.

Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I want to express my personal gratitude to the Senate majority leader, to the Senate Democratic leader, to my colleague from Texas who has just spoken for their eloquent statements, but really more for the unmistakable message that they send, which is that there are ultimately times of conflict abroad that involve the vital interests of the United States, as the current situation in Iraq does, no Democrats, no Republicans, only Americans standing side by side in support of the Commander in Chief and all those Americans in uniform who serve under him. 
That, I hope, is the message that will be heard in Baghdad, most importantly. If the Commander in Chief of the United States decides that military force is necessary to be employed against Iraq, the overwhelming majority of Members of the U.S. Senate will stand strongly behind him and behind those American personnel in uniform who will carry out that policy. 
Mr. President, the statements of the majority leader and the Democratic leader are the finest examples of bipartisanship and statesmanship. They remind us, though there may be disagreements in this Chamber on partisan lines, that, again, when challenged, when it comes to America's vital interests abroad, we will stand together above party lines. 
The administration has been very accessible, very forthcoming in consulting with both Houses of Congress about the challenge that Saddam Hussein and Iraq represent to us and to the security of our allies in the region and our soldiers in the region and of the world in general. I think we have to express our appreciation to the administration for that dialog that continues. 
What is at stake in Iraq today? For one, something that might be considered quaint in some quarters, meaningless in other quarters, international agreements are at stake, agreements to end the gulf war, promises made by Saddam Hussein about allowing inspections which would enable us--the world--to guarantee that he was keeping his promises to disarm, a request justifiably made by the victorious forces in Operation Desert Storm and required of those who were vanquished in that conflict. So it is the integrity of these agreements, in the first instance, that is at stake. 
Secondly, there are consequences, which is the threat that Saddam Hussein will use those weapons of mass destruction that we know he has; that he will use the ballistic missile, the delivery system capacity to deliver those weapons of mass destruction that we know he has in rudiment and is developing even further. 
We know, as one of my colleagues said a moment ago--I believe it was Senator Daschle--unlike other leaders in the world, including dictatorial leaders of rogue nations who possess weapons of mass destruction, this particular leader, Saddam Hussein, has used those weapons against his neighbor, Iran, in the Iran-Iraq war in the eighties, and against the Kurdish population of his own country. 
So our anger, our anxiety, our unease, our judgment that we have vital interests at stake is not theoretical. It is based on a course of behavior by this particular leader of this particular nation. We went through the entire cold war with enormous amounts of nuclear power in our hands and in the hands of the Soviet leaders, but there was, in the end, a kind of understanding based on a strange form of civilized premise, which is that those weapons would not ultimately be used, and they were not ultimately used. I don't think we can reach that same conclusion about this leader based on his own course of behavior. 
There is a way in which there is a line to be drawn in this case, just as we drew a line in the post-cold-war-world, when Saddam invaded Kuwait and threatened our neighbors and vital economic interests and energy supplies in that region and we acted, reacted and reacted forcefully and rolled him back. Just as in Bosnia, we saw ethnic conflict could divide Europe and create broader conflict there, and we acted and stopped it. So, too, in this case, we are called upon to show that we are willing to draw a line, a preventive line, against those who possess weapons of mass destruction--chemical and biological; some have called them the poor nations' nuclear weapons--that we will draw a line and say we won't tolerate it. We are going to act to impose a regime of promises to disarm and if those promises are not kept, the international community will act to enforce them. 
We have vital interests at stake in the region. We have thousands of soldiers there within range of these weapons of Saddam Hussein. We have allies in the region in the moderate Arab nations and in Israel, and we have vital economic interests in the oil supply in that region. 
Mr. President, the fact is that all of those interests, all that we have at stake there--international promises made by Saddam as a condition to the end of the cold war, the threat of weapons of mass destruction and delivery systems, the vital interests in the region, the necessity to draw a line against the use of chemical and biological poisons, which all of the military experts tell us will characterize and intensify the 
security threats to our region and most of the rest of the world in the next century--all of those threats are not just to the United States, they are surely to our allies in the region and are to most of the rest of the world. 
That is perhaps why so many nations have come to our side as we face the reality that the United Nations, not the United States, tell us of the refusal of Saddam Hussein to allow the inspections that he promised and, therefore, the fact that we have gone now more than 5 months with those sites uninspected and day by day the threat rises. 
That is why our closest and most steadfast ally, Britain, have joined us, are ready to stand and fly side by side with us. But they are not alone. Canada, Australia, the Netherlands, Bahrain, Kuwait, Israel and a growing number of others are prepared to join us. 
As much as we are heartened by this support, we don't see the same range of the coalition that we had leading up to the gulf war. Maybe that is understandable because the threat that the current crisis poses is not as immediate and accomplished, it is mostly imminent. In 1990, Saddam Hussein invaded his neighbor Kuwait and threatened Saudi Arabia and the rest of the Persian Gulf states, oil-producing states. In that circumstance, with a danger that was real and experienced, it was easier to assemble the broad-based coalition that we did. 
Today, the threat may not be as clear to other nations of the world, but its consequences are even more devastating potentially than the real threat, than the realized pain of the invasion of Kuwait in 1990, because the damage that can be inflicted by Saddam Hussein and Iraq, under his leadership, with weapons of mass destruction is incalculable; it is enormous. 
Therefore, I hope, though the circumstance may not be as clear, that other nations that have not yet forcefully expressed their willingness to stand with us and Britain and the other allies I mentioned will come to an understanding of that. It has been my hope all along that if the United States continued to lead, as we have, that the full range of coalition allies would, once again, stand by our side. 
I always remember the Biblical evocation which is, if the sound of the trumpet is not clear, then who will follow in battle? If the sound of the trumpet is clear, then I hope that the widest range of other nations in the world will follow into battle, if that is necessary, not simply to follow our leadership, but because their vital interests are at stake, in the resolution of this problem. 
Mr. President, I think the administration has made clear, and that is why I believe there is broad support for the possible attacks that may occur on Iraq, that its goals here are limited. If air attacks occur, these are not acts of revenge, these are not punitive acts which have no meaning. These would be acts and attacks that are aimed at accomplishing what the inspections were supposed to accomplish, that are aimed at accomplishing what the gulf war cease-fire agreement was supposed to accomplish, which is the diminution and ultimately the elimination of Iraq's capacity to wage chemical, biological or nuclear war against its neighbors or ultimately anyone in the world. That limited goal may not satisfy some people, but it is a reasonable goal at this time, and it is a goal that I think ultimately and effectively will enjoy the broadest support in the U.S. Senate. 
Mr. President, there are those who say, `Well, what next? What if this doesn't work?' I am confident it will work. When I say it will work, I mean I have the confidence the United States military has the capacity to strike at Iraq in a way that will, in fact, incapacitate, debilitate, postpone the ability of that country under Saddam Hussein to inflict damage on its neighbors with weapons of mass destruction. So that goal will be accomplished. 
I think the question of what is next is an appropriate topic of discussion. Some people say we should pull back and wait and see what, in that initial time of that military strike, if it occurs, it will gain us, to see whether diplomacy can work again, to see if we can build the fullness of the coalition and again confront Saddam with the opportunity to comply with the promises he previously made. 
Others, and I number myself among this group, are very skeptical of that policy. Diplomacy is always preferable to the use of force, and yet, I myself remain profoundly skeptical that an acceptable diplomatic resolution to this conflict is possible. 
It is a painful and sad conclusion, but it is based not on animus toward that country, certainly not animus toward the people of Iraq, but it is based on the record. The record I need not cite in detail, but we know about the violent way in which Saddam Hussein seized power in Iraq, eliminating those of his fellow Iraqis who were in his way, about the violent and dictatorial way in which he has ruled. Life doesn't matter when you stand in the way of him; of the means that he used to conduct the war against Iran, including weapons of mass destruction; of his invasion of Kuwait; of his flaunting of the very agreements he made to end the gulf war; of the taunting of the international community that he represents today. 
Mr. President, if this were a domestic situation, a political situation, and we were talking about criminal law in this country, we have something in our law called `three strikes and you are out,' three crimes and you get locked up for good because we have given up on you. I think Saddam Hussein has had more than three strikes in the international, diplomatic, strategic and military community. So I have grave doubts that a diplomatic solution is possible here. 
What I and some of the Members of the Senate hope for is a longer-term policy based on the probability that an acceptable diplomatic solution is not possible, which acknowledges as the central goal the changing of the regime in Iraq to bring to power a regime with which we and the rest of the world can have trustworthy relationships. That is not going to be simple. It is not going to come overnight. It involves an effort to work with Iraqi opposition to Saddam Hussein, to use some of the same methods that were used in the cold war, something as simple and yet as effective as Radio Free Europe which spoke so powerfully to the hopes and dreams of people who lived so long under the tyranny of the Soviets, the Communists, and do the same for the people who live under the tyranny of Saddam Hussein, 
to work with our allies to build the kind of alternative that will raise our hopes for peace in that region of the world. 
Those discussions about what may follow an air attack on Iraq are important. They are not easy. They deserve to be debated. 
For now I think what is most important is that people of both parties have come together on the floor of the Senate to speak to this challenge to international law, to America's vital interests, and to say, directly or indirectly, `Mr. President, if you, as Commander in Chief, act in this circumstance, in this crisis, you and the troops who serve under you will have broad bipartisan support in the U.S. Senate.' 
I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.

 Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to Mr. Hiram Bingham IV, a Connecticut native, who risked his life and sacrificed his career to rescue thousands of Jews from the Nazis while serving as a U.S. diplomat in Vichy France. Mr. Bingham performed these services despite the opposition of his superiors in France and in Washington, displaying a courage of conviction which demands both our recognition and greatest respect. 
Hiram Bingham IV died in 1987 and it was only last year that his son, William S. Bingham, discovered the records which brought his father's exploits to light. Survivors whom Hiram Bingham helped rescue have now petitioned Yad Vashem, Israel's Holocaust Memorial, that he be honored as a `righteous gentile' for having put his life and career on the line to save Jewish refugees. 
Hiram Bingham IV never sought glory for himself but as a man who put service to others before all other considerations he has earned our appreciation as a true American hero. In doing so he has extended the remarkable public service and honorable reputation of the Bingham family, one of Connecticut's great families.

 Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, since 1983, the United States Congress and the German Parliament have conducted an annual exchange program for senior staff members from both countries. The program gives professional staff the opportunity to observe and learn about each other's political institutions and convey Members' views on issues of mutual concern. The program is now in its 15th year and has strong support and participation from federal agencies as well as corresponding support from the German government. 
A staff delegation from the United States Congress will be chosen to visit Germany March 22 to April 4 of this year. During the two week exchange, the delegation will attend meetings with Bundestag Members, Bundestag party staff members, and representatives of numerous political, business, academic, and media agencies. Cultural activities and a weekend visit in a Bundestag Member's district will complete the schedule. 
A comparable delegation of German staff members will visit the United States for three weeks this summer. They will attend similar meetings here in Washington and visit the districts of Congressional Members. 
The Congress-Bundestag Exchange is highly regarded in Germany, and is one of several exchange programs sponsored by public and private institutions in the United States and Germany to foster better understanding of the politics and policies of both countries. The ongoing situation in Bosnia, the future expansion of NATO and the proposed expansion of the European Union, as well as plans for a single currency will make this year's exchange particularly relevant.

Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, a short while ago, the Senate adopted the foreign operations bill. Last week, the Senate adopted the Department of Defense authorization bill. Previous to that, we adopted the Defense appropriations bill for the coming year--all of those aimed at keeping America both strong and involved in the world. 
There is no small measure of common sense and reason for us to do that. Mr. President, all we have to do is follow the news of the day to see how much our own leadership in the world is depended upon by other people and how critical that leadership is to the peace and stability of the world. This is, apparently, the last day in which the people's forum, the Senate Chamber, will be open for public discussion, particularly in morning business, which is such an extraordinary and, I think, constructive forum for public debate. 
I want to address my colleagues on two matters that may well be acted upon, or decided partially at least, in the time after we leave this first session of the 105th Congress and before we come back in January. Those are events abroad relating to, first, Bosnia and then to Iraq. 
Mr. President, if I may speak briefly about the situation in Bosnia. As the record is clear here, acts of aggression were occurring, acts of genocide, slaughter, unseen in Europe since the end of the Second World War which, in this case, was being portrayed on our television screens every night, bringing understandable agitation and demands for action. Ultimately, particularly after the fall of Srebrenica and the slaughter that occurred there, the President led the NATO forces to decisive airstrikes, which led to the Dayton conference, which led to the Dayton peace accords and to the cessation of hostilities on the ground in Bosnia and the beginning of a civilian reconstruction of that war-torn country, based on the Dayton agreements, based on a goal of trying, over a period of time, to reconstruct a multiethnic country there in Bosnia, on the premise that partition into ethnic conclaves was inherently unstable because one group would inevitably strike another group. If one looks at this glass, there is still plenty of empty room in it. It is also a glass that, thanks to the allied effort, an effort that encompasses in this case Russia as well, not only has the slaughtering stopped and have troops been disengaged, but there is substantial progress being made on the road to civilian reconstruction. 
I have felt all along, Mr. President, that we made a mistake in setting deadlines for the presence of American personnel as part of, first, the IFOR and then the SFOR--Implementation Force and then the Stabilization Force--in Bosnia. I understand that the deadline was probably attached as a way to garner sufficient support for the American involvement. But, in my opinion, respectfully, it was a mistake. Better to have set out goals for our participation in Bosnia and when those goals were reached to withdraw, than to establish the expectation, both in this Chamber and more broadly among the public, that we were going to pull out by a date certain, only to have to come back and say, no, no, no, that is not what we meant, and then imposing another deadline. 
It is clear from statements that are coming from the President, the Secretary of State, others in the administration of our country, and our allies in Europe, that there is a strong inclination to keep American troops on the ground in Bosnia as part of a follow-on force after the previously, and I think mistakenly, set deadline of June 30, 1998. I support that inclination. I hope it is a fact, because I think if we pull out now--we Americans--the Europeans will follow suit, and what is likely to take place at this stage is a slide back downward into the pit of separation and of conflict. 
I do hope that, in extending our presence there, we are mindful of two factors. One is to not repeat the mistake of again setting an artificially explicit deadline. If we are going to stay there, let's try to define the goals most comfortably related to the Dayton process, the Dayton agreement, and see if we can express more generally what those goals are, and when we achieve them, be ready to pull out. 
Some have said--and it may be a good beginning point--that we can and should leave, we should not be there for a long time, we certainly should not be there forever. We can and should leave when the Dayton peace process appears to be self-sustaining. That is not a bad goal. So I hope, one, we don't repeat the mistake of setting an artificial and misleading deadline. 
Second, if we decide to keep American troops as part of 
the follow-on peacekeeping force in Bosnia as a way of guaranteeing that the conflict does not erupt there again, that we don't threaten stability in Europe, that we don't run the risk of a wider war throughout the Balkans and beyond. If we decide to keep American troops there, I hope we will leave it to the professional soldiers, to the Pentagon, to the Secretary of Defense, advised by our military on the ground in Bosnia, by the chiefs of the services involved here in the Pentagon, as to how many American troops we want to leave there. There has been some indication, some comment, that it would be a good idea to reduce the number of American personnel there as a way of showing that we continue to be on the way out. The fact is that we started out with almost 30,000; we are down to about 8,500 American personnel. 
The point I want to make is this: The administration should not feel pressured, as a way to build more support here or among the American people for our continued presence in Bosnia, to reduce the number of American soldiers that are there, unless that is what the generals in charge and the Secretary of Defense advise and request. We are getting down to a relatively small number of Americans there. We have an obligation to each and every one of them to make sure that we keep a critical mass present on the ground so that, in case of trouble, in case of conflict, in case of the eruption of hostilities, we have enough people and resources there so that we can minimize the risk of any damage to our personnel. 
This is an occasion like the next one I want to speak of, where, though there is disagreement here among Members of the Senate and the other body and the American people about whether or not and under what circumstances or not American personnel should remain in Bosnia, this Senator is convinced that if the President as Commander in Chief states the case, and particularly one which is strongly backed up, as to the number of American personnel there by our military, the majority of the Congress across party lines will support the President in that leadership. 
Second, Mr. President, is the question of Iraq--once again, very much on our minds and, once again, threatening stability under Saddam Hussein in the Middle East, an area of vital interest to the United States, morally, militarily and economically. This is a crisis that is totally the work of one man--Saddam Hussein. An agreement made to end the gulf war, in which we were the dominant power, with our allies involved an agreement by Iraq to have international inspection teams constantly there to make sure that Saddam Hussein and his government were not concealing or constructing weapons of mass destruction--ballistic missiles--done not in a punitive way, but because the record makes clear who Saddam Hussein is and what he is prepared to do. In the time he has been the leader of Iraq--I believe I have this number right--he has carried out five invasions of neighboring countries. When he has had capacity to wage warfare with gas, a relatively rudimentary form of chemical warfare, he has done so. He has used gas against his own people in Iraq to suppress an uprising. He used it against the Iranians in the Iraq-Iran war during the 1980's. There is some evidence to believe that he would have armed his personnel in the gulf war with chemical weapons that might have been used against American personnel were it not for his fear that we might retaliate with nuclear weapons. 
So we know the ambitions of this leader, we know his willingness, beyond the formal considerations of devastation to humans, to use every weapon in his control to achieve a wider hegemony over the Middle East and particularly over the oil resources there that we continue to depend on. 
As I said before, this crisis is one that is totally of his making--by forbidding Americans from being part of this international inspection team, by threatening now to evict, to eject, to push out of Iraq that small number of Americans that are part of that inspection team. And while the threat posed at the current moment is not as visually frightening and destabilizing as the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in 1990, its consequences, the consequences of U.N. inspections stopping and the Iraqis developing and broadening their capacity at special warfare, at warfare with weapons of mass destruction and the ballistic missile capacity to deliver them to distant targets, is every bit as consequential and profoundly disruptive of stability in the Middle East and profoundly threatening to the vital interests of the United States, and we have little choice but to respond. 
The threat may be at least as fundamental and destabilizing as the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in 1990. But the challenge to leadership internationally will be to marshal the same kind of international coalition against the possibility of Iraqi aggression that was marshaled in 1990 and 1991. 
Part of the problem is that time has passed and people's taste for conflict is reduced. People in some sense have to be reminded of what is on the line. Part of the problem is that some of those nations that stood by our side and fought with us in the Gulf war may have short memories and be drawn more by economic interests in doing business with Iraq than a realistic appreciation of the consequences of allowing Saddam Hussein to develop chemical weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missiles to deliver them. It won't be easy for those in the alliance--the international alliance--who understand the seriousness of this threat from Iraq under Saddam Hussein to marshal as broad an international coalition to respond. But it is most certainly a worthy effort and in our national interest. 
If we cannot by inspection guarantee that Saddam Hussein is not developing weapons of mass destruction and the ballistic missile capacity to deliver them against our troops on land and sea in the region to our allies in the Arab world and in Israel, then we must consider doing so by intervention--if not by inspection, then by intervention. Because history tells us--and it is fresh history--that whatever capacity for war making Saddam Hussein develops and possesses, he will use. And that is why it is so critical to deny him that capacity. 
The specific course that President Clinton and some of those of our allies who seem more likely to stand with us--such as the British, probably the Turkish, others, hopefully in the moderate nations of the Arab world--the specific course that President Clinton as Commander in Chief chooses to take is, of course, respectfully his judgment. But I hope in the fateful days that are ahead when this Congress is out of session and these decisions will probably have to be made that the President appreciates what I sense as I talk to colleagues here in the Senate, that there is a broad bipartisan understanding of the seriousness of the challenge that Saddam Hussein has cleverly and diabolically set before us; and that there will be broad bipartisan support for an effective response as determined by the President of the United States, hopefully in joint action with a large number of our allies. 
So, Mr. President, this has been a long session--a session of extraordinary accomplishments, certainly on the balanced budget, and some disappointment, of course, as always is the case in other areas. 
But, as we depart, we leave some immense decisions to be made by the President and the administration. And I hope that they will be made in the spirit that this Congress across party lines will support the Commander in Chief when he chooses to lead, and that across party lines we understand that partisanship, though it may occasionally rear its head too often perhaps here in Congress, certainly does end at the Nation's coasts when our security and our values are threatened throughout the world. 
I thank the Chair. I thank my colleagues for their patience. 
I yield the floor.

I am proud to be a member of the committee from which this bill has emerged, the Senate Armed Services Committee. I particularly wish to thank our chairman, Senator Thurmond, and our ranking Democrat, Senator Levin. These are two extraordinarily able, wise Members of the Senate who have worked together very well to produce this bill that meets our national security needs. 
We all know that we are in a post-cold war period. Perhaps the needs of defense are less in the minds of the public, but these are not matters that should be decided by public opinion polls. These are matters of national security, at the very root of why governments are formed, and they call out for leadership by those who have been given the privilege of serving, leadership in the interest of national security by all of us across party lines, across both Chambers of Congress, across Pennsylvania Avenue between the Congress and the White House to do the best that we can to provide for our national defense today and, in some ways even more difficult, particularly at a time of relative security such as we are in today to make the investments that are necessary so that we will meet the multiple possible threats to our security in the decades ahead. This bill I think does about as well as we could do at this point, and I am therefore proud to be here to urge our colleagues to support it. 
I want to state first that this is a bipartisan bill. There are a lot of things that happen around the Capitol that are much too partisan. Somehow we come here and we feel as if we have suddenly been placed on two teams on either side of the tug-of-war and you have to get on your side, and sometimes on all sides we lose a bit of sight of what the problem is and the urgency of working together in the national interest across party lines. 
I am very proud that on the Armed Services Committee, of course, there are disagreements, sometimes they tend to split more partisan than at other times, but as this bill, the product of the better part of a year's labor of the Armed Services Committee of the Senate, shows we have gotten together. We have come halfway across the bridge on a whole host of issues and problems, matters of real concern, and the feeling is we have had our voices heard both in the committee, in the Chamber and in conference. 
This bill really represents an act of bipartisanship. Because so much attention is focused on the partisanship around here, I think it is important to note that with some satisfaction and again thank the bipartisan leadership of the committee for having made that possible. 
Second, Mr. President, this is a bill that is a compromise and that has compromises in it. As a conferee on the Senate side, I must admit that the conference negotiations over this bill were protracted, difficult. There was much give and take. But in the end, which is again the nature of this process at its best, we were able to overcome many obstacles, some of which seemed intractable at times, all of which arose from what initially appeared to be difficult to reconcile positions. And despite these obstacles, the end result I think is a good bill that achieves the goal of adequately providing for our national defense. 
It is not a perfect solution, but we rarely achieve perfect solutions here. The question is will we be willing to bend a bit to get to a point where we have any solutions, and I think this bill does. It reflects compromise, the kinds of compromises that are honorable and make our political system unique and produce results. In the end, I would probably say that none of the conferees, House or Senate, were completely satisfied but none were completely disappointed neither, and the end result is a bill that moves us forward. 
I do want to say in a more targeted way that the bill protects the Senate position on two controversial issues, Bosnia and the B-2. 
Mr. President, the third basic point is that this bill has provisions that are essential to maintaining our military strength and particularly in providing adequately for our men and women in uniform, the finest fighting force in the world. 
But they will not continue to be so unless we provide for them. 
Let me cite a few of the matters in the bill that are so critical. There was some discussion of what would normally be unthinkable, that we might not pass a DOD authorization bill this year. But that would have been done at great peril and loss. 
This bill, for instance, provides authority for adequate funding for critical equipment procurement and R&D, research and development. I am privileged to serve as the ranking Democrat on the Subcommittee on Acquisition and Technology, chaired by my friend and colleague from Pennsylvania, Senator Santorum. There are some very important investments here that will provide dominance for the American military a decade or two from now. All of the glory that we achieved, the victory that we achieved in the gulf war, so much of it was made possible by research and development that began, not in 1990 or 1991 when we fought the war, but in the 1970's. This budget provides the same kind of first investments in future military dominance. 
Second, the bill provides authority for the Department of Defense to begin construction of fiscal year 1998 military projects, construction projects which include quality of life, and training-related facilities which are so critical, both to the morale of our forces and their capacities. 
Third, the bill provides lower end strength levels and increased flexibility for managing personnel strength. That is very important to the commanders. 
Fourth, the bill includes significant reforms of the existing structure for housing allowances and subsistence allowances for members of the military. 
Fifth, the bill includes authority for significant increases in the special pay and bonus structure, designed to respond to critical recruiting and retention problems, particularly in the Air Force. 
Sixth, the bill includes a 2.8-percent pay raise for active duty military members--it is not a lot, but at least an increase--a pay raise of 2.3 percent for Federal civilians, and an additional 0.5 percent increase in locality pay. 
It is a big bill. It is an important bill. It achieves some things that would not be achievable were this bill not passed. 
Senator Levin was speaking when I came into the Chamber. He was speaking about the depot issue. Obviously, there has been a lot of concern about that over the last several weeks--months, in fact. Today, as we consider this bill, some are still suggesting that the depot provisions of the bill may invite a Presidential veto. I certainly hope not. I hope such a veto is not being seriously considered within the White House because it would be profoundly harmful to our national defense by delaying authorizations such as those I have just described, which are critical for maintaining our current military readiness as well as delaying investments in our future military strength by way of critical procurement and R&D programs. 
The depot provisions of the bill provide, in my opinion, a level playing field among current Government depots and those which are being privatized. I understand the intense feelings in the various localities affected by this. But here again, across party lines, the best effort was made to achieve a compromise. These provisions on depots in the bill, I think, are fair and equitable to all sides involved in this extremely complex issue. No one set of interests prevailed. No one side achieved all their end goals. At the same time, no side walked away without retaining some of their core objectives here. In a very real sense, the depot provisions of this DOD authorization bill reflect the long and detailed, bipartisan effort of all of the conferees. I honestly believe that the conferees produced the very best possible legislation, not only generally but particularly on this issue which was so divisive and was thought to be possibly fatal to the chances of the overall bill, so important to our national defense, even passing. 
So, I say, respectfully, that any move to veto this bill because of the depot provisions would be very unfair and unwise. A veto would freeze other provisions in the bill for an unacceptable length of time, and there is no guarantee that what would follow would be a solution any better for the parties involved intimately than the one already painstakingly worked out. 
Last, a veto might act to dismantle current support for the bill and open up partisanship on a host of other issues, partisanship or parochialism, divisiveness, on a host of other issues which have already been resolved in the underlying bill through a lot of hard work. 
Let me say, finally, that I know there are many in Congress, some in the country, who feel we are still spending too much for defense. As hard as we on the committee struggled to authorize, as closely as we worked with the appropriators, the fact is--and I think it is important to point this out to our colleagues and to the public--this represents the continuation of more than a decade of defense budgets that have been lower in real dollars than the previous year. I believe this is the 13th straight defense budget of the United States of 
America that has been lower, in real dollars, than the preceding year's. 
First, I say that to say to those who say the military industrial complex, whatever, the hawkish people here, are not recognizing the change in the post-cold-war years and are still spending as much, that is just not true. 
Second, just look at the newspapers. Look at the instability in the Middle East with Saddam Hussein again acting against America's interests, against the world's interests. Probably, as the news today suggests, people in the U.N., not the United States, are alleging that Saddam Hussein is taking the action he has to try to frustrate inspection for the reason that we would guess--to conceal behavior, development of systems in his country that are not only a breach of the agreement he made to end the gulf war but which could be disastrous for the security of American personnel in that region, for the security of our allies, for the overall balance of power in that region. Look at the acts of terrorism that continue throughout the world. 
Even consider the efforts that the President made and has been making--they were highlighted last week because of the visit of the President of China, Jiang Zemin--an effort to try to find a course of peace, cooperation, integration; not to treat the Chinese as if they were our enemies inevitably--which is probably the best way to make them our enemies--but to try to build cooperative relations. That is the kind of effort that can only be made if we feel strong enough militarily to know that if our optimistic view does not work, we have the strength to protect our security interests and those of our allies--in this case in the Pacific region. 
There is a lot of change going on within our military structure, a lot of adjustment to the changing threats that we face, the reduced resources available. The outgoing immediate past Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Shalikashvili, presided over the presentation of a visionary document, `Joint Vision 2010.' Where should we be in the year 2010? How can we get our services to work better together? How can we take advantage of the enormous leaps forward in technology? 
The Quadrennial Defense Review, completed earlier this year, which was authorized in the DOD authorization bill for this year, fiscal year 1997, created, in my opinion, the broadest involvement within the Pentagon of personnel post cold war, about what the shape of the future threat is and what we need to face it. The National Defense Panel, also an independent panel created in the DOD bill last year, is in the final stages of its work. It is a Team B that we created of retired military personnel, outside experts and independent thinkers to provoke us, to make sure that we are doing everything we can to produce the best defense at least cost, that we are taking advantage of new technologies, of new forms of management. 
Mr. President, the military cannot be any more immune than the rest of the world to the changes occurring. I have told this story probably too many times. It goes back some months now. One day earlier this year, the lead story in the Wall Street Journal was how General Electric, which happens to be headquartered in my State, was going to be reporting record profits--billions. What was the focus of attention within that company, under a visionary, demanding president, Jack Welch? `How can we change to make sure that we continue to be as successful in the future as we are today?' Nobody who sits still is going to remain successful and strong. That is as true of our military as it is of any great institution in the private sector. 
That process is beginning. The Armed Services Committee has played a leading role in encouraging it. We have to keep that moving, as this bill does. So, overall this bill is a good bill, and it is an important bill, and it is a necessary bill. So I urge my colleagues across party lines to vote for the bill with a strong show of support as we send it eventually to the President with the very urgent hope, and I think the strong case, that the President will sign this bill knowing that it truly serves the primary goal of our Government, which is the national security. 
Mr. President, I again thank the chairman of the committee for his extraordinary leadership and the ranking Democrat, and I yield the floor.

Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to join my good friend and partner Senator Coats in introducing legislation that would speed the progress of what is arguably the most promising engine of education reform in America today, the charter school movement. 
Before discussing the legislation itself, I think it's important to talk first about the context in which it is being introduced and the ongoing debates here in Congress over how best to improve our public schools and expand educational opportunities for all students. In listening to much of the back and forth recently, particularly about efforts to promote a limited school choice program, it seems that too often these battles are being waged, in the words of the great John Gardner, between uncritical lovers and unloving critics, those who would defend the status quo in public education at all costs and those who would attack it at the drop of a hat, with neither side doing much listening. 
Making matters worse, the uncritical lovers have helped reduce this challenging, vitally important discussion to a simplistic either-or equation. Either you are for public education, which means you subscribe to a certain orthodoxy and dare not depart from it, or you are against it. Either you subscribe to a small set of educationally correct methods of reform or you are subverting public education as we know it. 
In my view, this shortsightedness is shortchanging our children. Given how many students are being served poorly by the status quo, particularly those living in urban areas who are trapped in deadening and in some cases deadly public schools, and given the crucial role that education will play in determining whether the American dream can be made real for those kids in the information age, we have an obligation to leave no policy stone unturned or untested and judge ideas by the simple, unalloyed standard of what works. We must be open to trying any plan or program that offers the hope of better education for our children. 
That is why Senator Coats and I have been advocating for some time that we experiment with private school choice, sponsoring a series of bills to set up pilot programs in our cities to see if giving low-income students the chance to attend a private or faith-based school will enhance their learning and force those failing public schools to improve. 
And that is why today we want to take this opportunity to express our support for the growing public charter school movement and to outline our plans to help make these innovative, independent programs the norm rather than a novelty in this country. 
I have been a long-time advocate of the charter approach, which grants educators freedom from top-heavy bureaucracies and their redtape in exchange for a commitment to meet high academic standards. After visiting, this week, with a group of passionate charter school operators and teachers at a national conference here in town, I am all the more convinced that charter schools represent what may be the future of public education. These folks are driving a grassroots revolution that is seeking to reinvent the public school and take 
it back to the future, reconnecting public education to some of our oldest, most basic values--ingenuity, responsibility, accountability--and refocusing its mission on doing what's best for the child instead of what's best for the system. 
The results speak for themselves. Over the past 3 years, the number of public charter schools have more than tripled, with more than 700 of them operating in 23 different States and the District of Columbia, and parents in turn have given these programs overwhelmingly high marks for their responsiveness to them as consumers. Broad-based studies done by the Hudson Institute and the Education Department show that charters are effectively serving diverse populations, particularly many of the disadvantaged and at-risk children that traditional public schools have struggled to educate. And while it's too soon to determine what impact charter schools are having on overall academic performance, the early returns in places like Massachusetts suggest that charters are succeeding where it matters most, in the classroom. 
Perhaps most heartening of all, a recent survey done by the National School Board Association found that the charter movement is already having a ripple effect that is being felt in many local school districts. The NSBA report cites evidence that traditional schools are working harder to please local families so they won't abandon them to competing charter schools, and that central administrators often see charters as a powerful tool to develop new ideas and programs without fearing regulatory roadblocks. 
The most remarkable aspect of this movement may be that it has managed to bring together educators, parents, community activists, business leaders, and politicians from across the political spectrum on common ground in support of a common goal to better educate our children through more choice, more flexibility, and more accountability in our public schools. In these grassroots may lie the roots of a consensus for renewing the promise of public education. 
We want to build on this agreement and the successes of charter schools and do what we can at the Federal level to encourage the growth of this movement. So today we will be introducing bipartisan legislation that will strengthen the Federal investment in charter schools and help remove some of the hurdles preventing charters from flourishing in every State. 
Our bill, the Charter School Expansion Act, would revamp the Federal Charter School Grant Program to make it more focused on helping States and local groups create new schools and meet the President's goal of creating 3,000 charters by the year 2000. We want to increase funding for grants to new schools, which help charter operators meet the high costs of starting a school from scratch, and better target that aid to the States that are serious about expanding their charter program. Our hope is that these changes will give States that have been slow to embrace the charter movement an incentive to get on board. 
In the near term, we feel this bill can be a starting point for overcoming our partisan and ideological differences and reaching a consensus on how to improve our schools and safeguard the hopes of our children. This proposal has already generated bipartisan interest both here in the Senate and the House, the administration has expressed its support, and we are optimistic it will be passed next year overwhelmingly. 
In closing, I would like to thank Senator Kerry and Senator D'Amato for joining Senator Coats and myself as original cosponsors of this bill. I would urge the rest of our colleagues, if they have not yet already done so, to take a close look at some of the truly innovative charter school programs being run in your home States and around the country. And I would ask you to join us in supporting this legislation to build on all the great work that's being done at the State and local level and help us chart a new course in education reform in America.

Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Chair and thank my friend and colleague from Georgia for his very kind comments. May I say, with his leadership on this issue, he has come right to the forefront of the national movement for education reform. 
Let me say first, briefly, how grateful I am, and I know the Senate across party lines, for the bipartisan leadership for the agreement that was achieved yesterday on scheduling the consideration by the Senate of campaign finance reform, which is important in its own right because of the significance of that effort, but also important because it frees us now to approach on the merits issues such as this. 
I am proud to be a cosponsor of this Education Savings Act for Public and Private Schools. It is a bipartisan cosponsorship, as will be clear from those who speak on behalf of it. 
Mr. President, it seems to me that of all the challenges that we have before us as we try to make this great country of ours even greater and spread the opportunities beyond those who have them best now, the most important place we can invest is in education, the education of our children. 
As we look at the education system in our country, I think we can say with some pride that the system of higher education is really doing quite well, but that it is the elementary and secondary schools, in making sure that our children get a good start on the road to education and self-sufficiency, that really need help. 
There are a lot of good things happening in our public and private and faith-based schools, but too many of our kids are still being educated in schools that are either in terrible shape physically, schools in which their personal security is threatened by crime in the schools, or schools in which there is not adequate teaching and innovation going on. 
This measure is a classic attempt to create a partnership between the Government and families and businesses to help people better educate their children at the elementary and secondary level. It is a tax incentive, a small one. It is like dropping that pebble into the lake, and it is going to create ripples out for individual children and for our society that I think will be dramatic. 
I want to make just a few points. 
This recommendation of these educational savings accounts builds exactly on the higher education savings accounts that we adopted just a few months ago with broad bipartisan support. In that case, you could put $500 in. The income would be tax free, particularly if you took it out for years in higher education. It had income limits in it for means testing, if you will. 
This proposal of ours takes that idea and simply extends it to K-12 education, with one big change--two, I suppose. One is that you can put in not just $500 but $2,500 in and others can invest in those accounts--grandparents, uncles, aunts, businesses. I wouldn't be surprised, if this is adopted, that labor unions will begin to negotiate with their employers to put matching contributions into the savings accounts for their kids. 
The point I want to make is this. A lot of anxiety and opposition has been expressed about this proposal. It is the same proposal that most of us voted for enthusiastically just a few months ago for higher education. So why is it so frightening now 
and it was so much accepted before? Why was it middle-class-tax relief then and it is now some sort of giveaway to wealthy people? 
I think if you focus on the merits of this, understand what independent analysis has told us that 70 percent of those who will benefit from this will be sending their kids to public school, that it can be used not just for tuition payments but for a broad array of support services--transportation, home schooling, purchasing a computer, et cetera. 
This is the kind of program that dreams are made of, that dreams are realized from. Parents who are working hard trying to find a better way for their children will be able to put a little money in these accounts or have some relatives put some money in, or convince the employer to put some money in and make it easier for them to take their children and put them in the schools where they want them, public or private or faith-based, or give the kids the support they need to get the better education. 
I think this is a good proposal whose time has come, and I am proud to be a cosponsor. I thank Senator Coverdell for his leadership on this, and I yield the floor.

Mr. LIEBERMAN. 
Mr. President, I am pleased and honored today to introduce legislation with my colleague Senator Dodd to name the Federal courthouse in New Haven, CT, after our dear friend and the former eight-term mayor of New Haven, Richard C. Lee. Congresswoman Rosa DeLauro is introducing the same proposal in the House of Representatives. 
If it may be said that Federal buildings should help reflect the very best of the principles, purposes and spirit of America, then this courthouse could have no more appropriate name above its doors than that of Mayor Lee. For Dick Lee is the quintessential American, proud, principled, hardworking, and productive. In New Haven, he shook loose entrenched bureaucracies and forged new community coalitions dedicated to rebuilding New Haven after years of neglect and blight. He became a nationally recognized urban pioneer and helped to change the landscape of the American city. 
Dick Lee was born in New Haven. He loves the city and its richly diverse people. In May of last year, Mayor Lee was honored by the New Haven Colony Historical Society. During that tribute, Prof. Robert Wood of Wesleyan University drew inspiration from Mayor Lee's eloquence about his work. Dick Lee said that the core of a mayor's job was `wiping away tears from the eyes' of a city's people so that `each tear becomes a star in the sky' and not a source of daily despair. `Filling the sky above with stars' was his highest calling. `The tears in the eyes of the young and the old, the hungry, the unloved, the ill-housed, the ill-clothed, and worst of all, the ignored' were not to be tolerated. 
Dick Lee was raised in a devout Irish Catholic family that was not blessed with wealth but with greater gifts: with faith, talent, and the willingness to work hard to better themselves and their community. He served for many years on the Board of Aldermen of New Haven and held a number of journalism jobs, including 10 years in public relations at Yale University. In 1949, he became the youngest man to run for mayor in New Haven's history. He lost that year by 712 votes. He lost 2 years later by only two votes. But he did not give up on himself, or the city of New Haven and was elected mayor in 1953. 
Once in office, Dick Lee devoted himself with extraordinary energy and imagination to the human and physical renewal of New Haven. One of his most provocative ideas was that the greatest post-World War II problems in our cities--poverty, unemployment, and poor housing--could not be solved by the cities or States alone. The Federal Government had to become a partner in America's urban redevelopment. 
Dick Lee worked tirelessly and with enormous success during the Eisenhower Administration to bring Federal programs to New Haven. As head of the Urban Committee of the Democratic National Committee in 1958, Lee authored the first versions of Model Cities and War on Poverty legislative proposals. And after his dear friend, John F. Kennedy was elected, Dick Lee exercised a large and constructive influence on the national effort to renew America's urban areas and to restore hope and opportunity to the people who lived in them. 
Dick Lee also understood that just as the human face of New Haven needed reinvigoration, so did the city's physical appearance and infrastructure. For this, Dick Lee turned first to a plan by Maurice Rovital who developed a blueprint for New Haven while a member of the Yale faculty. But then he boldly invited many of America's greatest architects to design buildings for his city, making New Haven one of America's greatest architectural crossroads. 
Dick Lee appointed a deputy mayor and administrator of redevelopment. From there, the real work began. That work included rebuilding downtown New Haven, salvaging the Long Wharf area, restoring Wooster Square, constructing the Knights of Columbus headquarters and the Coliseum, residential rehabilitation, rent supplements, nonprofit housing sponsors and the renewal of inner-city neighborhoods. 
Mayor Lee forged new coalitions to reaffirm his city's sense of community and make it easier to get things done. His Citizens Action Commission was a unique amalgam of business, labor and civic leaders and was designed to build support for the redevelopment effort. 
Robert Dahl, in his book `Who Governs? Democracy and Power in the American City,' wrote that Mayor Lee `had an investment banker's willingness to take risks that held the promise of large long-run payoffs, and a labor mediator's ability to head off controversy by searching out areas for agreement by mutual understanding, compromise, negotiation, and bargaining. 
He possessed a detailed knowledge of the city and its people, a formidable information gathering system, and an unceasing, full-time preoccupation with all aspects of his job. His relentless drive to achieve his goals meant that he could be tough and ruthless. But toughness was not his political style, for his overriding strategy was to rely on persuasion rather than threats. 
Robert Leeney, former editor of the New Haven Register and a wise and eloquent observer of the local scene wrote:  
New Haven and the problems of New Haveners have shaped Dick Lee's life. When the Senate seat, later filled by Thomas Dodd, hung like a plum within his grasp he wouldn't reach for it because the Church Street project was badly stalled and home needs took first priority in his public vision and on his personal horizons. His simple belief in--and his unshakeable dedication to--this city and its people started young and they have never ended. . .. He grew up to citizenhood with a classic, almost a Greek, sense of the city-state's call upon his talents and of its shaping effect upon his life and the lives of his neighbors. . .. 
Mr. President, law is the way we choose to express our values as a community, our aspirations for ourselves and our neighbors. In that fundamental sense, naming the grand federal courthouse in New Haven which sits proudly on the old New Haven Green and next to city hall is an honor which Mayor Dick Lee thoroughly deserves. In his public service, he worked tirelessly to express the best values of his community and to help its people realize their dreams for themselves.

Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce today The Innovative Environmental Strategies Act of l997. I'm honored that Senators Daschle, Moynihan, and Kerrey have joined me as cosponsors, and that the legislation is being introduced in the House by Congressman Dooley and Congresswoman Tauscher. I'm also very pleased that the legislation has been endorsed by the Clinton administration and has received positive responses from representatives of industry and environmental groups. I look forward to a process of building further consensus on this bill from all affected interests. 
The legislation allows companies to propose alternatives to environmental requirements if those alternative proposals will achieve better environmental performance. The legislation provides EPA with the authority to waive or modify regulatory requirements for this purpose. It is designed to encourage more pollution prevention and to promote better, more cost-effective solutions for environmental protection. 
This legislation seeks to build on both the work of President Clinton's Project XL--standing for excellence and leadership--and the Aspen Institute which undertook a 3-year effort to reach consensus among a wide group of divergent interests on an alternative path to achieving a cleaner, cheaper way to protect and enhance the environment. The Aspen Institute's work resulted in an excellent report, `The Alternative Path, A Cleaner, Cheaper Way to Protect and Enhance the Environment.' 
This bill modifies legislation introduced at the end of last Congress. At that time, I indicated that I welcomed all proposals and suggestions on how to alter and improve the bill. I have received a significant number of comments from industry, governmental and environmental group representatives. The new bill attempts to reflect many of those comments, in addition to a new GAO report examining EPA's reinvention efforts, `Challenges Facing EPA's Efforts to Reinvent Environmental Regulation,' and a recently released report by the National Academy of Public Administration, `Resolving the Paradox of Environmental Protection.' The National Academy report recommends statutory authorization for EPA's XL program. 
There is clearly a wide consensus in this country that our environmental laws have performed remarkably well. As the writer Gregg Easterbrook has pointed out, environmental protection is probably the single greatest success story of American government in the period since World War II. 
In many cases, however, we need to do more to provide the level of protection most Americans expect from government. For example, over one third of our rivers and lakes still do not fully meet water quality standards. Health advisories for eating fish have increased. The number of people suffering from asthma has reached epidemic proportions in some communities, particularly among children. 
Pollution prevention--preventing pollution before it occurs--is one approach that can help us do both better both in terms of protecting the environment and actually saving companies money. The greater efficiency resulting from less waste disposal and reduced use of toxic chemicals can significantly bolster the competitiveness of companies. 
Recently, I listened to a presentation indicating that perhaps the Nation is not doing as well in pollution prevention as we should be. A l995 report by the research group INFORM, `Toxics Watch l995,' reviewed thousands of documents submitted by industry to EPA to show whether progress was made to further pollution prevention. While 25 percent of the forms indicated some effort in pollution prevention had been made, the remaining 75 percent gave no such indication. And, according to INFORM, while some leading companies have taken major pollution prevention steps, the broader picture is troublesome: total waste generation is increasing. 
While these facts show there is clearly a need to improve protection of our environment and pollution prevention, there is just as clearly a need to review our methods of environmental protection in order to find better, more efficient, more innovative ways to achieve greater progress toward meeting our environmental goals. In some cases, the traditional approaches to regulation have hindered companies from doing a better job at pollution prevention. 
There is a growing consensus that innovative environmental strategies can form the basis for a new approach to environmental protection that will achieve superior environmental results, including greater pollution prevention, at less cost for regulated industry. This consensus can be seen, for example, in the work of the President's Council on Sustainable Development which brought together leaders from government, environmental, civil rights, labor and native American organizations in an effort to achieve consensus on national environmental, economic and social goals, as well as in the work of the Aspen Institute. 
This bill establishes an innovative environmental strategies program at EPA. The Administrator of EPA is authorized to enter into approximately 50 agreements with regulated entities seeking modifications or waivers from environmental requirements if certain criteria are met. The basic premise of the bill is that better environmental performance can be achieved by allowing environmental managers at companies, in partnership with an active group of community stakeholders, to develop their own means of reaching environmental goals. This approach recognizes that the regulated industry is now in an excellent position to experiment and decide what approaches will yield better environmental results than the company is achieving under existing regulations. Allowing flexibility can substantially reduce compliance costs and make industries more competitive, provide for much greater community involvement in the decisions of their neighboring industrial plants, foster more cooperative partnerships, and encourage greater innovation and pollution prevention. 
Another key element of this program is incorporating the lessons learned from the innovative environmental strategies into the overall regulatory structure of the Agency, where appropriate. 
While the bill authorizes approximately 50 innovative strategy agreements, these individual strategies should have widespread benefits for other companies as the Agency incorporates the lessons learned into its overall approach to environmental protection. 
Let me discuss a few specific provisions of the bill. 
First, the bill establishes benchmarks from which to determine whether better environmental results will be achieved under the innovative environmental strategy. For existing facilities, the benchmark generally will be either the level of releases of a pollutant into the air, land or water actually being achieved by the facility or the level of releases allowed under the applicable regulatory requirements and reasonably foreseeable future requirements, whichever is lower. The Administrator is given some flexibility in determining the appropriate measurement for the benchmark. For example, measuring releases per unit of production encourages pollution prevention but may result in releases of concern to the community; the Administrator should take both these factors into account in determining whether a per unit measurement is appropriate. The Administrator shall determine whether an innovative environmental strategy achieves better environmental results based on the magnitude of reduction in the level of releases or improvement in pollution prevention relative to each benchmark. In addition, the Administrator shall evaluate other benefits that would result from the strategy. These include whether the strategy results in environmental performance more protective than the best performance practice of comparable facilities or improvement in environmental conditions that are priorities to stakeholders, even if those conditions are not regulated under EPA statutes. 
Different types of innovative environmental strategies are possible under this legislation. For example, in some cases, a facility may demonstrate better environmental results by showing 
a reduction in releases of pollutants and, in exchange, seek a modification of reporting or other paperwork requirements. In other cases, a facility may demonstrate better environmental results by showing a reduction in releases of pollutants, but seek modification of a rule to allow for flexibility with respect to emission levels at different sources within the facility. There may be some cases where the innovative environmental strategy would result in large decreases in some pollutants while resulting in a small increase in another pollutant. But there are a number of specific requirements that must be met under those circumstances. Among other requirements, the Administrator must determine, based on a well-established analytic methodology acceptable both to the Administrator and the stakeholders, that the strategy will achieve better overall environmental results with an adequate margin of safety and will not result in an increase in the risk of adverse effects or shift the risk of adverse effects to the health of an individual, population, or natural resource affected by the strategy. I recognize that it is difficult to make such determinations because we have inadequate information about many chemicals and we often do not know how properly to evaluate cumulative or synergistic effects. The Administrator should pay close attention to these factors in evaluating projects. These examples are only illustrative of a range of potential projects. 
The bill also provides that in appropriate cases, the Administrator may establish a benchmark for measuring better environmental performance based on pollution prevention. 
The bill requires that the innovative environmental strategy provide a means and level of accountability, monitoring, enforceability and public access to information for all enforceable provisions at least equivalent to that provided by the rule that is being modified or waived. A related requirement is that adequate information must be made accessible so that any member of the public can verify environmental performance. Other requirements that must be met by the petitioner are set forth in section 7. 
Effective stakeholder participation is the second key element of the legislation. Any company submitting a proposal must undertake a stakeholder participation process. One of the criteria for approval of a project by EPA is that the stakeholders have obtained adequate independent technical support for an effective stakeholder process. Under the bill, the stakeholder process is open to anyone, except a business competitor, subject to manageability factors. The stakeholder group should genuinely represent the full range of interests affected by projects and the policies to be shaped by projects. Involving citizens, including workers and members of the local community, in the development of an innovative environmental strategy is absolutely critical. Companies that have formulated successful innovative environmental strategies have told me that without the support of the local community these strategies simply will not work. Empowerment of the local community through stakeholder processes will help build trust and make implementation of the agreement easier. In other words, the innovative environmental strategy should be a partnership between the proponent and the stakeholders. 
The bill requires the Administrator to give great weight to the views of the stakeholders. Obtaining broad community support for the strategy, as shown through stakeholder support, is very important. Additionally, the stakeholders and the proponent of the strategy may decide as part of the guidelines setting up the stakeholder process, that the stakeholders as a group or individual stakeholder participants should have a veto right with respect to whether the strategy goes forward. If the proponent still presents a proposal for the strategy even with such objections, the Administrator is required to reject the strategy if the objection has a clear and reasonable foundation and relates to the criteria for approval. The principle here is simple: stakeholders and the facility owner need to come to agreement on the guidelines that will govern the project. This agreement on the guidelines should be reached at the start of the process. It must be followed; if not, the Administrator will not be able to make the finding that the requirements of section 6 of the statute have been met. 
The bill also attempts to address the recommendations made in the GAO report of July 1997, `Challenges Facing EPA's Efforts to Reinvent Environmental Regulation', which examined EPA's XL program. First, the GAO concludes that EPA will be limited in its ability to truly reinvent environmental regulation without legislative changes. Second, the GAO recommends that the Agency's reinvention initiatives include an evaluation component measuring the extent to which the initiative has achieved its intended effect. Therefore, the bill requires that, within 18 months after entering into an agreement, the Administrator provide a report evaluating whether the lessons learned from a particular strategy can be incorporated into the overall regulatory or statutory structure of the Agency. The legislation also requires a broader report to Congress within 3 years. 
Finally, the GAO proposes that EPA develop a systematic process that would help address problems that come up during reinvention projects in a timely fashion. This process should be set up to identify the kinds of problems that can be resolved at lower levels within the Agency and which should be elevated for management's attention. While the bill does not specifically address this recommendation, I hope that EPA will seriously examine how it can implement this constructive recommendation. 
As the GAO report notes, the EPA has undertaken a broad range of reinvention efforts. This legislation in no way affects the ability of EPA to proceed under its appropriate authorities with those efforts, including agreements under XL.

Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation aimed at returning some common sense to one aspect of the Federal Government's Indian lands policies. My bill, the Indian Trust Lands Reform Act of 1997, arises out of a problem Connecticut and other States have been struggling with for the last few years. 
The bill would amend the Indian Reorganization Act of 1934 to reinforce its original purpose: helping Indian tribes and individual Indians to hold on to or obtain land they need to survive economically and become self-sufficient. Congress passed the 1934 act after the landholdings of some tribes had dwindled down to acres. Tribes and their members were selling and losing land to foreclosures, tax arrearages, and the like. The 1934 act gave the Secretary of the Interior the authority needed to help tribes hold on to or acquire land on which they could earn a living and, further, to hold those lands in trust for them so they would not be sold or otherwise lost. Once the United States takes land into trust for a tribe through this process, the land becomes part of the tribe's sovereign property. This means that State and local governments no longer have jurisdiction over the land, and the land is removed from those governments' tax, zoning, and police powers. 
Economic conditions for some tribes have improved since 1934 through a variety of commercial, agricultural, and other enterprises, but many are still struggling. Few could be described as rich or even comfortable; far too many still live in poverty. The 1934 act should remain available to help those tribes who still need assistance from the Federal Government in attaining economic self-sufficiency. 
As our experience in Connecticut has shown, however, that act is now being used to achieve goals far removed from its original purpose. As a result of the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act of 1988, many tribes have established casinos and gambling operations, and, although gaming has not brought riches to many of those tribes, some have been very successful, particularly in my home State. One of the most successful gambling casinos in the country is located in eastern Connecticut and is owned and operated by the Mashantucket Pequot Tribe. The success of the tribe's Foxwoods Casino has been well chronicled. Established in 1992, the casino has been open 24 hours a day, 7-days a week ever since. Whatever one thinks about the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act or gambling, either morally or as a vehicle for economic growth, the Mashantucket Pequots seized the opportunity presented to them by the Indian Gaming Act. They have developed an extraordinarily successful, well-run casino in record time. Annual casino revenues for the 500-member tribe reportedly approach $1 billion. By any measure, the tribe has become very wealthy. 
Given the tribe's tremendous financial success, it is not at all surprising that it has decided to buy more land near its reservation in order to expand and diversify its businesses. According to press accounts, the tribe owns over 3,500 acres outside of the boundaries of its reservation, in addition to the approximately 1,320 acres that is held in trust on its behalf within the reservation. The tribe is now the largest private landowner in southeastern Connecticut. It already runs several hotels outside of its reservation's boundaries, and tribal leaders have at various times talked of building a massive theme park and golf courses on its off-reservation land. 
The tribe owns its land in fee simple and so is free to develop it like any other property owner might. But unlike other property owners--who must develop their land in compliance with State and local zoning laws and who must pay taxes on the land and on the businesses conducted on the land--the tribe has claimed it has the option, under the 1934 act, to ask the Department of the Interior to take that land in trust on the tribe's behalf, thereby removing the land from all State and local jurisdiction. This is an option because the Department of Interior interprets the 1934 act as being available, with limitations, to all federally recognized tribes, regardless of whether the tribe's situation bears any resemblance to the conditions that originally spurred Congress to enact the 1934 provisions. 
And, this is an option the Mashantucket Pequots have exercised. In 1992, the Department of Interior granted the tribe's request to take into trust approximately 20 acres located outside the tribe's reservation boundaries in the neighboring towns of Ledyard and Preston. In January 1993, the tribe filed another application, this one to have an additional 248 off- reservation acres taken in trust. The affected towns of Ledyard, North Stonington, and Preston challenged that request. Nevertheless, the Department of Interior granted that request in May 1995, subject to certain conditions regarding the land's development--a decision the towns and the Connecticut attorney general are challenging in Federal court. In March 1993, the tribe applied to have 1,200 more off-reservation acres taken in trust. That request was sent back to the tribe because of legal deficiencies in the application, but reapplication by the tribe is expected, and past statements by tribal leaders suggest that more applications may be filed in the future. 
The effect of the tribe's and the Department of Interior's decisions involving off-reservation lands has been unsettling, to say the least, on the tribe's neighbors--the residents of the small towns that border the reservation. Once the United States takes land into trust on behalf of a tribe, as it has attempted to do here, boundaries change permanently. 
The land is no longer within the jurisdiction of the State or local governments. It is not subject to local zoning, land-use or environmental controls. Taxes cannot be collected on the land or on any business operated on the land. And State and local governments may exercise no police powers on the land unless invited by the tribe to do so. 
The plight of the towns surrounding the Mashantucket Pequot lands show that these problems are not just theoretical. Ledyard, North Stonington, and Preston are small communities whose combined population is about 25,000--less than half the number of visitors the Foxwoods Casino receives on a typical summer weekend. The towns have a combined annual tax revenue of approximately $25 million--less than half the amount of revenue the casino's slot machines generate in 1 month alone. Obviously, towns of this size cannot absorb a business of this size without there being any consequences. As a result of the Casino's success, the character of the towns has been permanently altered, and the costs of local government--from crime prevention to road maintenance to countless other things--have increased, all at the same time that the 1934 act has precluded the towns from exercising zoning and other controls and from collecting taxes to help defray the newly imposed costs. 
Given the financial resources of the tribe and the apparent willingness of the Department of Interior to take land into trust on their behalf regardless of any evidence that the tribe needs additional trust lands, many residents wonder where this will lead. I question the policy justification for the United States to change the boundaries of three Connecticut towns unilaterally so that an extraordinarily wealthy tribe--this one or any other --can expand its gaming or other business enterprises, free of taxes and local land-use controls, particularly when that tribe is perfectly capable of expanding its businesses on the thousands of trust and nontrust acres it presently owns. I question whether Congress--which enacted the 1934 act `to provide for the acquisition, through purchase, of land for Indians, now landless, who are anxious to make a living on such land * * *' and `to meet the needs of landless Indians and of Indian individuals whose landholdings are insufficient for self-support' (Senate Report No. 1080, 73d Congress, 2d Session 1-2 (1934))--intended in 1934 that the law would be used in this fashion. 
The authority for the Department of Interior to grant the tribe's request is now subject to review in the courts. The courts will have to decide whether the 1934 act even applies to this tribe and, if so, whether the Secretary acted properly. The courts will have to decide as well whether the 1983 Mashantucket Pequot Settlement Act independently prohibits trust acquisition by the tribe outside of reservation boundaries and whether the trust acquisition complied with applicable Federal environmental laws. 
To avoid future disputes and controversy, my bill would amend the Indian Reorganization Act to return to its original purpose. It would prohibit the Secretary of Interior from taking any lands located outside of the boundaries of an Indian reservation into trust on behalf of an economically self-sufficient Indian tribe, if those lands are to be used for gaming or any other commercial purpose. It directs the Secretary of Interior to determine, after providing opportunity for public comment, whether a tribe is economically self-sufficient and to develop regulations setting forth the criteria for making that determination generally. Among the criteria that the Secretary must include in those regulations to assess economic self-sufficiency are the income of the tribe, as allocated among members and compared to the per capita income of citizens of the United States, as well as the role that the lands at issue will play in the tribe's efforts to achieve economic self-sufficiency. May I note that I understand that some tribes do not have reservations in the traditional sense, and so the language of this bill will have to be adjusted in the future to address the situation of those tribes. 
In short, my bill is very narrow in scope, aimed solely at ensuring that the Department of Interior's awesome power to remove lands from State and local authority is used only in accordance with the original intent of the 1934 Act. The bill would not impose any restrictions on the Department's authority to take on-reservation land into trust. It would not affect the ability of the Secretary to assist tribes that genuinely need additional land--whether on or off their reservations--in order to move toward or attain economic self-sufficiency. It would not even affect the ability of the Department of Interior to take into trust off-reservation land for wealthy tribes needing the land for non-commercial purposes. The bill contains explicit exemptions for the establishment of initial reservations for Indian tribes, whether accomplished through recognition by the Department of Interior or by an act of Congress, and in circumstances where tribes once recognized by the Federal Government are restored to recognition. And, of course, it does not impact the ability of wealthy tribes to buy as much land as they want for whatever purpose they want it. The only thing my bill does do is to require tribes who are economically self-sufficient and who wish to engage in commercial activity outside of their reservation's boundaries to do so in compliance with the same local land-use and tax laws applied to every other land holder. 
Mr. President, many residents of Connecticut applaud the success that the Mashantucket Pequot Tribe has had with its Foxwoods Casino. The tribe employs thousands of Connecticut residents in an area of the State that was hard hit by a lingering recession and cuts in defense spending. The tribe's plans for economic development of the region, while not universally liked, have many in the area genuinely excited about future opportunities. 
I have discovered though that even among residents cheered by the tribe's success and supportive of its plans, there is a strong sense of unfairness about how the land in trust process is being used. They believe there is no reason why this tribe, or any other in a similar situation, needs to have the U.S. Government take additional, commercial land in trust on the tribe's behalf outside of its reservation boundaries. What is at stake here, after all, is not preserving a culture or achieving self-sufficiency, but expansion of an already successful business on lands that are owned by the tribe and developable by them, as they would be by any other landowner. Extra help is simply not needed, and continuing to grant it is not fair and, in my view, ultimately counterproductive for all involved.

Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my friend and colleague Senator Lott, and the other cosponsors, in offering this bill which addresses what I believe is one of the most serious and urgent national security threats facing this country. Ballistic missiles in the hands of a nation that has been our most implacable foe in the recent past and that has been the single most intransigent supporter of terrorism against this Nation and our allies should fill any right thinking person anywhere with the most profound fear and concern. Indeed, we here in this body have often expressed our concern. We have given the administration the tools to address this problem, specifically in the Arms Export Control Act and in the Iran-Iraq Sanctions Act. Regrettably, our concern and these tools have not yet resolved this threat. In fact, it is widely and reliably reported that persons in Russia continue to provide both technology and assistance to Iran such that Iran may be now only 8 months from acquiring ballistic missiles that could be combined with weapons of mass destruction to threaten United States forces and our allies and friends in the Middle East. And soon after that, our forces and allies throughout Europe. 
This would be a profound change in the balance of power in the region, and strike a serious, perhaps fatal blow to our ability to contain Iran until it becomes a responsible member of the community of nations. It would allow Iran to threaten friendly Arab states, making it harder for them to cooperate with the United States. It would raise the risks to U.S. military forces in the region. And it would threaten the free flow of oil in this critical region, which could create crises in places far from the Persian Gulf. 
We must act to try to prevent this from happening. We must tell Russia in no uncertain terms that we are serious, and that the time for slow progress in shutting off Russian assistance is past. 
Many of us are aware that the degree of government control over dangerous technology in the former Soviet Union has eroded considerably. While trying to remedy this potentially frightful situation, the Russian Government must contend with other pressing internal issues. The results are that persons or groups within Russia have had the latitude to transfer technology to rouge states such as Iran. 
We have the opportunity as well as the obligation to stand up, be counted, and take reasonable steps to deter this type of potentially cataclysmic activity. While we cannot expect to prevent all such technology transfers to rogue states, we do have the ability to check the flow of it through sanctions aimed at persons engaged in such activity. We also are able and must take appropriate action against those governments that condone such activity, whether they are organizing and abetting such transfer or merely looking the other way when their citizens engage in these activities. 
For many years, the United States and the few other members of the missile club of nations could be reasonably assured that these missiles armed with nuclear weapons would not be used. That was because the leaders of these nations were generally reasoned individuals who shared many of the same goals. As this technology has spread to other countries--and continues to expand at an alarming rate--some of the leaders share very different views on methods to solve confrontation. We have to actively guard against these weapons becoming available to what most of the world considers to be unstable states governed by leaders whose thinking is outside the mainstream. 
We have been engaged in dialogue across a wide spectrum with our friends and allies in trying to prevent this from happening. As I mentioned earlier, the prospect of a nuclear capable, militarily powerful Iran armed with ballistic missiles, is clearly not in our national interests. Our efforts at putting controls on the flow of technology to rogue states have been laudable, but the sieve has been leaking. 
The sanctions we are proposing will further stop the diffusion of technology and lead toward a more stable Middle East. I fully support this effort because it will help prevent further technology transfer into an area that has seen several major wars in the last thirty years and that remains a region of vital national interest not only to us but to most of the industrial world. 
In closing, I want to take this opportunity to express my thanks to Senator Lott for his leadership in this matter. This is an important step toward a safer world.

Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, the National Research Investment Act of 1998, which Senator Gramm and I introduced this morning, is important legislation designed to reverse a downward trend in the Federal Government's allocation to science and engineering research. Although America currently enjoys a vibrant economy, with robust growth of over 4 percent and record low unemployment, we should pause for a moment to examine reasons which underlie our current prosperity. 
In one of the few models agreed upon by a vast majority of economists, Dr. Robert Solow won the Nobel Prize for demonstrating that at least half of the total growth in the U.S. economy since the end of World War II is attributable to scientific and technological innovation. In other words, money spent to increase scientific and engineering knowledge represents an investment which pays rich dividends for America's future. 
Dr. Solow's economic theory is the story of our Nation's innovation system--a system that has transformed scientific and technological innovation into a potent engine of economic growth for America. In broad terms, our innovation system consists of industrial, academic, and governmental institutions working together to generate new knowledge, new technologies, and people with the skills to move them effectively into the marketplace. Publicly funded science has shown to be surprisingly important to the innovation system. A new study prepared for the National Science Foundation found that 73 percent of the main science papers cited by American industrial patents in two recent years were based on domestic and foreign research financed by governments or nonprofit agencies. 
Patents are the most visible expression of industrial creativity and the major way that companies and inventors are able to reap benefits from a bright idea. Even though industry now spends far more than the Federal Government on research, the fact that most patents result from research performed at universities, government labs, and other public agencies demonstrate our dependence on these institutions for the vast majority of economic activity. Such publicly funded science, the study concluded, has turned into a fundamental pillar of industrial advance. 
Last week's awarding of the Nobel Prize to Dr. William Phillips from the Government's National Institute of Standards and Technology provides a wonderful example of how publicly funded science pays dividends. Dr. Phillips was honored for his work which used laser light to cool and trap individual atoms and molecules. I am told that the methods developed by Dr. Phillips and his coworkers may lead to the design of more precise atomic clocks for use in global navigation systems and atomic lasers, which may be used to manufacture very small electronic components for the next generation of computers. Dr. Phillips' achievement is the most visible recognition of the Department of Commerce's laboratory. Since 1901, however, the agency has quietly carried out research to develop accurate measurement and calibration techniques. The NIST laboratory, together with Commerce's technology programs, have greatly aided American business and earned our Nation 
billions of dollars in industries such as electrical power, semiconductor manufacturing, medical, agricultural, food processing, and building materials. 
Yet, despite the demonstrated importance of publicly funded scientific research, the amount spent on science and engineering by the Federal Government is declining. Senator Gramm has already noted that `in 1965, 5.7 percent of the Federal budget was spent on nondefense research and development. Thirty two years later, that figure has dropped by two-thirds to 1.9 percent.' If you believe as I do, that our current prosperity, intellectual leadership in science and medicine and the growth of entire new industries are directly linked to investments made 30 years ago, then you have got to ask where will this country be 30 years from now? 
At the same time, it is likely that several countries, particularly in Asia, will exceed on a per capita basis, the U.S. expenditure in science. Japan is already spending more than we are in absolute dollars on nondefense research and development. This is an historic reversal. Germany, Singapore, Taiwan, China, South Korea, and India are aggressively promoting R&D investment. These facts led Erich Bloch, the former head of the National Science Foundation, to write that the `whole U.S. R&D system is in the midst of a crucial transition. Its rate of growth has leveled off and could decline. We cannot assume that we will stay at the forefront of science and technology as we have for 50 years.' 
The future implications of our failure to invest can be better understood if we consider what our lives would be like today without the scientific innovations of those past 50 years. Imagine medicine without x rays, surgical lasers, MRI scanners, fiber-optic probes, synthetic materials for making medical implants, and the host of new drugs that combat cancer and even show promise as suppressors of the AIDS virus. Consider how it would be to face tough choices about how to protect the environment without knowledge of upper atmospheric physics, chemistry of the ozone layer or understanding how toxic substances effect human health. Imagine communication without faxes, desktop computers, the internet, or satellites. Less tangible but nonetheless disconcerting, is the prospect of a future for our country of free thinkers, if all new advances and innovation were to originate from outside of America's shores. 
Although difficult, the partisan conflicts and rifts of the past several years may have performed a useful service in clarifying the debate over when public funding on research is justified. Senator Gramm and I have discussed this topic at some length. We believe it is a mistake to separate research into two warring camps, one flying the flag of basic science and the other applied science. Rather the research enterprise represents a broad spectrum of human activity with basic and applied science at either end but not in opposition. Every component along the spectrum produces returns--economic, social, and intellectual gains for the society as a whole. The Federal Government should patiently invest in science, medicine, and engineering that lies within the public domain. Once an industry or company begins to pursue proprietary research, then support for that particular venture is best left to the private sector. This is what we mean by the term `precompetitive research.' 
With introduction of the National Research Investment Act of 1998, we begin a bipartisan effort to build a consensus that will support a significant increase in Federal research and development efforts. I am particularly appreciative of the support given today from nearly 100 different scientific and engineering professional societies which collectively represent many more than 1 million members. Accomplishments of your members illuminate the role that science and engineering plays in the innovation process. 
In a Wall Street Journal survey of leading economists published in March, 43 percent cited investments in education and research and development as the Federal action that would have the most positive impact on our economy. No other factors, including reducing Government spending or lowering taxes, scored more than 10 percent. While Senator Gramm and I are certainly committed to fiscal responsibility and balancing the budget, we think that the country would be best served by promoting investments in education and R&D and reducing entitlement consumption spending. Failure to do so now may well imperil America's future economic vitality and our leadership in science and technology.

Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I am honored to be joined by my distinguished colleagues Senators Hagel, Kerrey, and Murkowski to introduce the United States-China Relations Act of 1997. I would also like to thank Congressman Bereuter whose bill H.R. 1712, we have included in this act. The United States-China Relations Act of 1997 is legislation that will set us on a course toward more fully integrating China into the international community of nations while protecting our national economic and political interests and preserving our values. 
We are at a critical juncture in our relations with the People's Republic of China. How we choose to manage China's emergence as a major global power will profoundly impact the shape of the international system in the 21st century, a situation not dissimilar to the late 19th and early 20th centuries when Germany, Japan, Russia, and the United States emerged to challenge Britain and France for world leadership. 
British and French diplomacy failed although their task was not an easy one. Two terrible wars stained the history of this century. We must try to do better. We must work to establish an acceptable framework for peacefully integrating China into the evolving international economic, security, and political systems. And the core question is whether to continue on our current path of cooperation and integration or choose the path of containment and isolation. 
During this session there has been much debate about which direction we should take in our relations with China. Most of the legislation that has been introduced regarding China has assumed the worst, centered on containment, and favored economic sanctions to remedy a host of Chinese transgressions. This policy of containment is ultimately premised on a view that China will be our next great enemy. 
Some of my colleagues ask us to pass laws that use punishment as the primary tool in our bilateral relationship. These proposals overlook a number of realities: the ineffectiveness and unproductiveness of punitive legislation in changing China; the importance of maintaining and fostering trust and confidence in such an important bilateral relationship; the real potential for retaliation by China; and the potential upsides of a constructive relationship with China. Ultimately, those bills proposing containment of China will neither achieve their stated aims of changing China's behavior nor promote America's more general national and international interests. 
The rest of the world will not join us in our effort to isolate China. That makes containment improbable. Our best policy option is to work to integrate China. 
Before rushing to any conclusions about China's intentions, it is helpful to take a closer look at its development over the past 20 years. China has been engaged in a slow but steady effort to integrate itself into existing international systems. It has made efforts to be active in the United Nations, it has participated in a number of multilateral organizations, and has adapted some domestic institutions and policies to the demands of the international community. 
I visited China last March with my friend and distinguished colleague, Senator Connie Mack of Florida, and was struck by the revolutionary changes occurring there. This time the revolution is being driven not by Mao's little red book, but by the mass quest for cellular telephones and personal computers, and incidentally, all the personal freedom of communication that goes with them. 
The central government in China is still not tolerant of opposition. Political and religious dissidents are in jail. On the other hand, average Chinese seem to have lost their fear of open and spirited conversations with Westerners. And Senator Mack found the Catholic churches during that Holy Week before Easter packed with worshipers. 
The Chinese Government has undertaken a slow but steady deregulation of the economy since it allowed for free enterprise in the countryside in 1982. Deregulation and the marketization of the Chinese economy has led to unprecedented improvements in the living standards--and purchasing power--of ordinary Chinese. In the past 15 years, China's per capita GDP has more than tripled, from $889 to $2,923, and is forecast to be $4,190 in 2000. Not uncoincidentally, China's demand for United States exports has increased in similarly substantial leaps. United States goods and services exports destined for China have increased from $3.7 million in 1980 to $11.1 billion in 1995. China is now America's fifth largest trading partner. Similarly, United States foreign direct investment in China has increased significantly. 
On the other hand, we have a large and growing trade deficit with China that is unacceptable. A prosperous and stable relationship will only continue for as long as we have fair access to China's markets. 
On balance, China's economic and political reforms are becoming more, not less, consistent with American core values. The transformation of a socialist command economy into a controlled market system has allowed for the emergence of a new class of entrepreneurs and has promoted individuals' freedom to decide what to consume, where to live, what to do as a livelihood. The State sector of the economy has steadily declined, and increasing numbers of Chinese now work for employers that do not answer directly to the central government or the Communist Party. This means that the Communist Party's ability to control and monitor individual's social, political, and economic lives has diminished substantially. Explicit political reforms have been fewer, but today there are more local elections being held in 
China than at any other time in its modern history. The legal system has been reinvented over the past two decades, and has seen in recent years substantial, though still inadequate, improvements in criminal procedure and judicial review of administrative abuses. It can be said in summary that, the reforms of the past two decades have led to increased personal liberty, a strengthened legal system, and the beginnings of a civil society, although there is still a very long way to go. 
In the clearest and most significant vote about China this year, a bipartisan majority in the House of Representatives chose to continue China's most-favored-nation trade status. But, after the vote, a flurry of bills were introduced expressing congressional opposition to China's economic, military, and human rights record. It is unfortunate that the Congress is sending mixed messages about this very important bilateral relationship. 
To encourage China's current path of reform and development and to help ensure that China's inevitable transformation into a global economic and strategic power occurs in a way not adverse to United States interests or values, the United States must have an active China policy that aims at integration instead of isolation, and relies on carrots rather than sticks. 
To ensure that our economic interests are met, we need to encourage China's increasing integration into international trade and investment regimes on commercially viable terms. This should help promote further liberalization of the Chinese economy while at the same time increasing American access to China's markets and thus decreasing the United States-China trade deficit. At the same time, the United States Government can more actively promote bilateral economic ties with those regions in China where human rights and labor conditions have shown improvement. Moreover, we should at every opportunity encourage China in the research and development of new energy efficiency and renewable energy technologies. 
China's integration in international regimes also promotes American strategic interests. The bilateral strategic relationship can be strengthened, however, by developing closer exchanges with the Chinese military leadership. By opening ongoing lines of communication with the military, we will be in a better position to obtain accurate information about China's military modernization program. Through such proactive measures we will be in a better position to make Beijing more accountable for its strategic weapons exports. 
It is time for Congress to end the ambivalence and build a consensus for a new China policy. Toward that end, along with my distinguished colleagues Senators Hagel, Kerrey, and Murkowski, I am today introducing the United States-China Relations Act of 1997. 
This legislation assumes that China will emerge as a superpower in the coming decades and become a nation with which the United States can and must have cooperative relationships --and that our relationships will be more cooperative if our economic, strategic, human rights, and environmental relations are viewed as distinct components of a larger, mutually-beneficial whole. It is based on a conclusion that China today is different from the China of the Cultural Revolution two decades ago and the China of Tiananmen Square a decade ago. 
Here are some of the key provisions of the United States-China Relations Act of 1997: 
Require an annual accounting of our economic relationship with China. Despite the growing significance of our trade relationship, barriers to U.S. exports should not be tolerated. The President would be required to submit an annual Economic Balance of Benefits Study to the Congress. The report would analyze the impact of existing bilateral trade agreements with China on United States employment, balance of trade, and United States international competitiveness. 
Encourage China's integration into multilateral economic organizations. Just as it is important to have enforcement sticks, there should be carrots to encourage China's international economic integration. The bill requires the President to develop criteria for support of China's participation in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development and G-7 meetings, two groups that China is far from being accepted into, but in which it aspires to membership. 
Give China permanent MFN upon accession to the WTO. First, I would like to credit Congressman Bereuter for this innovative idea. This provision seeks to induce China to grant United States exporters adequate trade benefits and/or make significant progress toward WTO membership by authorizing a tariff increase on imports from China if those conditions are not met and by granting permanent MFN status once China becomes a WTO member. 
Require greater information on energy and national security issues. The President should establish a bilateral United States-China committee on energy security and one for food security. These committees would help develop a bilateral policy for securing a stable supply of energy from politically volatile regions and securing food for China's large population. The bill also includes a sense-of-the-Senate resolution that the President and Congress continue to expand contact and exchanges between United States and Chinese national security personnel. 
Establish a commission to promote the rule of law, respect for individual rights, religious tolerance, and civil society in China. This includes a bilateral commission on human rights with China; an exchange of legal professionals, government staff and religious leaders; and multilateral action on human and workers' rights. This last provision would include a prisoner information registry with information on all political prisoners, prisoners of conscience and prisoners of faith. The commission could recommend the imposition of specified sanctions to the President for human rights violations. 
There is one provision more than any other that characterizes the tone and thrust of this act. It calls for the formation of a commission to prepare a profile of China province by province. This profile then would serve as a basis for consideration of transactions with China by the Export-Import Bank and the Overseas Private Investment Corporation in those identified provinces. 
This provision is particularly helpful in improving and strengthening our relations with China. By opening up OPIC programs to regions that have acceptable human rights, labor, and environmental standards, we are increasing investment into China at the same time we are advancing our values. It is a provision that encourages China to improve its human rights record without punitive economic sanctions. It uses a carrot instead of a stick. 
America's economic and strategic interests, as well as our fundamental values, are best served by encouraging China on its path of economic and political reform. 
China's geopolitical and economic rise are inevitable developments. How we react to China's transformation and manage the bilateral relationship, however, is within our discretion. United States-China relations are at a critical turning point, and the real challenge before us now is how to peacefully integrate China into the world community, and work with China to ensure world prosperity and stability in the 21st century. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the United States-China Relations Act of 1997 which I am proud to introduce with Senators Hagel, Kerrey, and Murkowski be placed in the Record.

 Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the accomplishments of Hispanos Unidos Contra El SIDA/AIDS, Inc. of New Haven, CT, as they celebrate their 10th anniversary. 
In 1987, this organization was founded by a group of concerned citizens as Connecticut's first Latino AIDS agency. Since that time, this dedicated group of men and women have worked to both curb the spread of AIDS through education and provided support services to infected members of the Latino community and their families. By serving as a fully bilingual/bicultural resource, support and advocacy agency, Hispanos Unidos Contra El SIDA/AIDS has not only been effective at serving its own clients, but has helped other community and government organizations better serve the Latino community as well. 
The dedication and commitment of the staff are evident not only in their casework but also in the partnerships and coalitions they form with State and local government and nonprofit agencies. In this way they are able to assist those most immediately in need while also working to better coordinate local, regional and statewide efforts to prevent the spread of AIDS. They are the true embodiments of the ideals of compassion and community service, and the people of Connecticut thank them for the important work they have done for the past ten years and will continue to do in the future.

Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank my colleague from Indiana. 
Let me pick up on what was said by Senator Coats, citing that this amendment is bleeding the system. Good God, the system is bleeding. It is not this amendment that is bleeding it. What is bleeding it is the failure of the system, and the blood that is being lost are the hopes and dreams of thousands of parents and children trapped in the school system who know it is a failure for them, who know it is not working for them. 
I appeal to my colleagues, particularly my Democratic colleagues, please look at the facts, cut through the rhetoric. I know there is strong pressure from interest groups representing the establishment, the education status quo. I know that my colleagues on the Democratic side are great believers in the public school system. But remember those words that I think were spoken by John Gardner, that too often debates are between those who are unloving critics and uncritical lovers. We all love the public school system, but open our eyes, look what is happening here. 
Senator Kennedy earlier in charting progress in the school system in the District of Columbia said in the last period of time the number of uncertified teachers went from more than 50 to 33 percent. Is that a sign of progress? Yes, it is progress. That is why Senator Brownback and I are working with Delegate Norton and others to bring more money to the District and support General Becton. 
But think about the reality. How many Members of this Senate would send their children to a school system in which one-third of the teachers were uncertified, unless they were forced to send them there because they didn't have the money to get them out. 
The Senator from California earlier said, gee, let's take this money, and my colleague and friend from Illinois added, let's put it on top, give it to all the kids, instead of just benefiting this relatively small group of 2,000. 
The Washington Post said a while ago in an editorial that the D.C. school system is a well-financed failure. So choice here is whether you will put $7 million on top of the more than $600 million we put into the system and better finance the failure instead of giving that money and focusing it on 2,000 kids and thereby giving them the opportunity for a better education and a better life.

Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Chair. 
This, as the tone of the debate indicates, is a critically important debate with consequences that go well beyond the subject at hand, campaign finance reform, because the infusion of massive amounts of money into our political process affects so many other areas in which we are supposed to govern and to legislate, and it is why this appropriately becomes a priority topic. 
As I hear the seriousness of the debate in the Chamber, I must share my own disappointment that there is murmuring outside the Chamber that nothing is going to happen this year, that there is not going to be any campaign finance reform legislation adopted, that this is just a lot of sound and fury which, as the bard reminded us, will signify nothing. 
Well, that would be an infuriating tragedy, an outrageous, in my opinion, abdication of our responsibility, a shocking refusal to face the facts that have come out at the hearings of the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee, on which I am privileged to serve. That committee's hearings show that ours is a system in crisis, and it is a crisis that affects so many aspects of our Government. 
I hope these murmurings are wrong, and I hope that the debate we have begun in the Chamber will signify more than noise; it will signify the beginning of a genuine effort to change the laws, to go back in some ways to where we were after the last great campaign finance scandal, which was the Watergate scandal, to go back to the laws adopted after that scandal which set limits not only on contributions but on spending in a campaign. 
In my capacity as a member of the Governmental Affairs Committee, I have had what might be called a front-and-center view of the extraordinary failures of the status quo campaign finance system, failures that routinely stem from the corrupting influence of big money in politics. As if peeling back the layers of an onion, in this case a spoiled onion, our investigation slowly revealed story after story of unseemly and negligent behavior that all too often seemed to cross over the line into lawlessness. 
I know the Governmental Affairs Committee's hearings were controversial. Sometimes they were criticized for being partisan. In fact, sometimes they were too partisan. But the fact is, though they were not always orderly and they weren't always neat and they weren't always pretty, they told a story. They told a story of a system gone out of control and the consequences it has had on our great democracy. 
There was the international entrepreneur who never registered to vote because he thought his money was more influential than his franchise. The sad fact is, he was right. 
There was the story of the White House official who advised a potential contributor, whom he had never met, whom he had just talked to over the phone, about how to effectively skirt tax liabilities on a proposed donation of somewhere between $1 million and $5 million. 
There was the Republican Party research institute that defaulted on a loan from a Hong Kong businessman and then swindled him out of the interest he had earned on his own money, which was deposited as collateral for the loan; and the party chairman, Democratic Party chairman, who allegedly called on the CIA--although there is doubt on this, conflicting testimony, but an allegation that the chairman called on the CIA to help burnish the image of a questionable contributor. 
In no uncertain terms, as far as I am concerned, people with fat wallets bought access at the highest levels of our Government, executive and congressional, and some Government leaders were perfectly willing to auction off their clout. 
As California entrepreneur and major Democratic donor Johnny Chung observed, `The White House is a subway: You have to put in coins to open the gates.' 
Clearly, the two parties, in their mad scramble for money, shamelessly exploited during the 1996 election cycle well-intentioned campaign finance laws to the point of rendering them meaningless. In the end, their debased standards of the pressure-cooker world of high-stakes election campaigns mocked one of the basic principles of our democracy, the principle that all citizens have an equal vote, an equal voice in the governance of their country, an equal opportunity to influence its policies. 
Now we have an unfettered political fundraising system that neither serves the public interest nor deserves the public trust. No wonder the American people look on politics with a jaundiced eye. No wonder more and more of them have concluded their vote doesn't count, so they don't vote. I saw a survey awhile ago of 165 countries in the world today who conduct elections. The United States of America is 139th in terms of those of voting age who actually vote. Our proud democracy--we are proud to call it the greatest democracy in the world--we are 139th among the countries of the world in the percentage of our population that can vote that actually does vote. Don't you think part of that has to do with the conclusion that millions of our fellow Americans have made that their vote doesn't count, not if they don't have money? 
The proposal offered by Senators McCain and Feingold is, in my opinion, our best hope for changing this unacceptable status quo and for reviving public faith in our Government. 
The key to real reform, I conclude after sitting through the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee hearings, is less big money and less special interest money in the election process. That is exactly what the McCain-Feingold bill would do. The central provision of this bill is a ban on soft money; that is, a ban on unlimited contributions to the two national parties from corporations, unions, and wealthy individuals. 
It is hard to believe, but it actually was 1907 when a law was passed by this Congress that made it illegal for corporations to contribute to political campaigns. In the 1940's a similar law was passed regarding labor unions. How is it that in the 1996 election corporations and labor unions contributed hundreds of thousands of dollars individually, millions in some cases? It is because of this so-called soft money, this little opening that was created in a vaguely worded law that was then interpreted by the Federal Election Commission to allow people to give unlimited amounts of money to parties to help voter registration, get out the vote, that turned into a loophole large enough for a fleet of trucks--not Mack trucks but Brinks trucks--to go driving through. 
The explosive growth of soft money and the way it is spent represents, in my opinion, the most egregious abuse of our campaign finance laws today. Most of the controversial donations from the 1996 campaigns were soft-money contributions. Most of the foreign money contributions that we took evidence on at the governmental Affairs Committee hearings were soft-money contributions. 
Soft money has played a role in Federal elections since 1980, the year after Congress tried, the way I mentioned, to enhance the role of national parties. But in 1996 it exploded--$272 million that we know of spent by both national parties in soft money in 1996, 13 times the amount spent in 1984, an increase that has dramatically changed the landscape of campaign fundraising and of American democracy. By the November 1996 elections, the soft-money loophole had become a cash bonanza for the two parties, an irresistible opportunity to raise and spend money, each driving the other to keep up, and the easiest way to do it was to raise big money. It became, for that reason, the most expedient way for an elite class of contributors to buy access; frankly, for an elite class of contributors to be exploited, in some sense coerced, by the political class into giving contributions of unprecedented size. 
The quintessential example of trading money for access was the brutally honest and now legendary Roger Tamraz. An international banker-businessman, Tamraz donated $300,000 to the Democratic Party because he wanted to talk to President Clinton and other high officials of our Government about his plans to finance an oil pipeline through the former Soviet Union. The National Security Council warned against admitting Tamraz to the White House. They had already decided, in the due and diligent exercise of Governmental decisionmaking, that his proposal was not the right proposal for a pipeline in that particular part of the world. They understood that he was falsely claiming White House support for his projects. They warned that, if high officials of our Government gave him even a meeting, even were seen close to him, he would trade on that proximity in the area of the world in which he was doing business. 
But Tamraz was nothing if not persistent. He said to us at one point that, `I'm the kind of person, if I can't find my way through a door, I'll go through a window. And if that window is closed, I'll go through another window until I get in.' He went so far as to enlist a buddy at the CIA to lobby the administration on his behalf. But what he really did was kept going to the window with his checkbook. Eventually, he was invited to six different social gatherings. 
The very troubling clincher is this. When I asked Tamraz when, not whether he registered to vote--because I then was going to ask him what party he was in, trying to prove the fact that parties didn't matter to him, ideology didn't matter to him, he was just buying access, he was trying to influence our Government with bucks--when I asked him when he registered to vote he shocked me by saying he wasn't registered to vote. When you think about it, in his world, the world that soft money invites, there is no need to register to vote. His money was more important and bought more access than any vote could. It was as if he was saying: Oh, voting is a nostalgic exercise for those millions of people out there who don't have influence--most Americans. They are the ones who can take the time to register and vote. I buy my way, in America, to the highest levels of power. So Mr. Tamraz seemed to be saying. 
The right to vote, which was central to the creation of our country, the right to vote, for which our founders and succeeding generations of Americans have fought and died, didn't matter to Tamraz. He figured it out--$300,000 bought him a lot more access in this democracy than anybody who just votes had. This standard is so well embedded in our political system that when I asked him whether he got his money's worth, even though he never actually won White House support for his pipeline nor got a separate private meeting with the President, Tamraz said next time he'd double that donation to $600,000. 
I am not naive. People have always tried to do what Roger Tamraz did. As long as there have been governments, as long as there have been people with any power in any human society, people have tried to seek favor by conveying items of worth, and they will continue to do so. But, when soft money contributions open the door to unlimited contributions, when the competitive pressure of our political campaigns raises leads to spending without limits, the temptations will be that much greater for the influence peddlers and purchasers, for the hustlers to try to buy something big. Frankly, the temptation will be that much greater and, ultimately, for many, irresistible, for those in power to sell what the influence purchasers are trying to buy. That is why, in short, we have to ban soft money. 
The attempt to influence Government with purchases is nothing new. Look in the Bible. There is a prohibition there against judges or other leaders accepting gifts from anyone who comes before them for judgment, anyone who is affected by their leadership. 
The wisdom there was based on an understanding of human nature and the need for those in government to set limits to protect themselves and those they governed. People in government who exercise power are, after all is said and done, beneath their titles, no matter how high they are, just human beings with the same frailties as everyone else. Put them in the public competitive reality of a political campaign, and too many will not be able to say no, particularly while they see their opponents saying yes. 
The Governmental Affairs Committee's hearings have built significant support for banning soft money. Just last week, John Sweeney, the president of the AFL-CIO--his organization, in fact, contributed millions in soft money, almost all of it to the Democratic Party in the 1996 cycle--said, soft money donations are `polluting our political system.' 
Last week, a group of business leaders made essentially the same statement demanding a ban. Chief executives at Monsanto, General Motors, and Allied Signal have already dropped out of the soft money game. Why? They said it is impossible to track contributions to gauge their success. In other words, the payoff for five- or six- or seven-figure contributions is simply not worth the expense. 
I will tell you something else they didn't say. Members of the Senate may have heard, as I have, from people who were solicited for soft money contributions, large contributions. They felt coerced. They felt it hard to say no. Think about it, if you are the executive of a business and you have a lot of contact with the Government and are regulated by the Government, if you are the executive of a business that has matters before Congress and a high official in the executive branch or the legislative branch calls you and asks for a large soft money contribution, it is hard to say no. 
If we are successful only in banning soft money, however, as important as that is, our work will still be incomplete. Although I must say, if we could just ban soft money, I think we will have achieved enormously significant reform. 
But in the best of all worlds, it is not enough, and in the best of all bills, the McCain-Feingold bill, they don't stop at banning soft money. It is important to go on. Money is like water, it flows to the weakest point. Just as water spills through an unplugged gap in the dike, once one hole is filled, it will find the next hole, or it will find the weakest point in the dike to make a hole. Political money seeks unregulated gaps in our election laws. 
I do not say this simply as a matter of physics or theory. I say this, again, as a result of what we heard in the hearings before our committee. Money blocked by contribution limits to candidates flows instead into unlimited soft money contributions to parties. Money blocked by a soft money ban will be diverted in increasingly large amounts to unregulated issue ads. 
Issue ads are paid for by soft money raised by independent advocacy groups and parties. They are supposed to be about specific policy issues, not specific candidates. That is why unlimited amounts of money may be spent. But issue ads, as we heard discussed on this floor in the 2 days of this debate, have actually become stealth candidate ads. 
Widespread abuse in the last election saw these ads hiding behind the veil of issue advocacy, even as they promoted or attacked individual candidates. 
A study by the nonpartisan independent Annenberg Public Policy Center found that 87 percent of the so-called issue advertisements broadcast in 1996 mentioned a candidate by name--87 percent mentioned a candidate. Almost 60 percent showed the likeness of a candidate. 
The Annenberg study further found that more than 40 percent of the 1996 ads plainly attacked candidates, not issues. One of the witnesses before our committee said last week that by his review of the ads, the issue ads were actually more negative to candidates 
than the candidate ads were. Some ads don't bother with issues at all. 
One of these ads, run by opponents of a congressional candidate in Montana, simply used the air time to rehash the candidate's marital problems. Ads broadcast by the Democratic and Republican parties ostensibly on the issues in the 1996 Presidential campaign were little more than biography spots at best, promoting the election of President Clinton or of our former leader, Bob Dole. 
Issue ad sponsors, like the AFL-CIO or the National Rifle Association, are under no obligation to disclose the money they spend when they do issue ads. But when the ad zeros in on specific candidates, as we all know was the case and as the Annenberg study so brilliantly documents, clearly there is at least a violation of the spirit of the Federal spending limits. It is an end run on what the law says can be spent on a campaign. 
No one can be held accountable for the false or misleading information those ads might convey, because the public doesn't know who paid for the ads. And yet in the 1996 election cycle, advocacy groups and the two parties spent more than $135 million on issue ads. That is about one-third of the $400 million that was spent on broadcast advertising by all Federal candidates last year. 
Kathleen Hall Jameison, director of the Annenberg center, concluded that issue ads `set an agenda different from that of either candidate and, in some cases, drown out the voices of these who are actually running for office.' 
We run the risk here, Mr. President, of the candidates becoming bit players in a contest that occurs at a higher level between dueling interest groups spending millions of dollars running issue ads with soft money. 
McCain-Feingold appropriately proposes a more precise distinction between ads supporting or opposing an issue versus those supporting or opposing a candidate. I am convinced, based on my own reading of the Supreme Court decisions, that that provision will withstand the constitutional test. 
The soft money ban and the crackdown on illegal issue ads, which I have spoken to, are two of the most critically important and politically realistic reforms that we can hope to make. I say politically realistic in the sense of being related to the political reality that we all have experienced in campaigns, and it was vividly documented in the hearings that the committee held. 
Other provisions in the McCain-Feingold bill--strengthening disclosure requirements, outlawing the solicitation of campaign donations in Federal buildings and limiting the amount of personal money that candidates may contribute to their own campaign--will also help bring our fundraising system back under control. 
But, Mr. President, I regret that the bill has been stripped of the voluntary spending limits in it, because I believe that ultimately the best way to end corruption or the appearance of corruption in campaigns is to impose spending limits on campaigns. 
I know that there is a disagreement among Members on whether that would be constitutional. Under the Buckley versus Valeo decision, mandatory spending limits would not be constitutional. If I had my druthers, as Li'l Abner used to say, personally I would like to see that 1976 Supreme Court decision overturned, because I think the central principle established by that case, that money equals speech, is not right, and, even if it had some validity in theory in 1976, it no longer reflects the reality of the last 20 years of campaign raising and spending. 
Money doesn't equal speech. How can speech be free if it costs money? How can speech be free if you have to spend money to get it or, as I believe my friend and colleague from Georgia, Senator Cleland, who is on the floor, said in our committee--and I paraphrase knowing I will not achieve the pungency that he did--if money equals speech, if you have to have big bucks to have speech, that means the people who don't have big bucks aren't going to have any speech. Is that what the Framers of the Constitution intended when they adopted the first amendment? I can't believe that they did. 
Several times in the history of the Supreme Court, the Justices have applied principles of law that did damage to our country and that experience ultimately proved were not realistic. That most tellingly was the case when the Court upheld segregation laws on a theoretical basis of equal protection when the reality of equal protection was not there. 
It took until 1954 when a massive amount of evidence was brought before the Supreme Court to show that separate but equal was in fact not equal--only then did the Court strike down those discriminatory laws. In another way, this was true with some of the labor laws adopted in the earlier part of this century. 
Minimum wage laws were originally struck down as violations of employee's rights to contract until a case was built by advocates for those laws which showed that the right to contract, though noble in theory, was not real when you had two unequal parties negotiating the contract. So the Supreme Court reversed itself, and upheld the minimum wage laws and maximum hour laws to protect working people from being exploited. 
Respectfully, I think the same scenario is true with regard to the interpretation of the first amendment rendered by the Supreme Court of 1976 in Buckley. Let me just point out for the record, which a lot of folks forget--I forgot myself before I went back and read the Buckley decision--that the post-Watergate reforms, the 1974 Federal Election Campaign Act didn't just say that Mr. Buckley, who was a part-time resident of my State and truly one of the Lord's noble people, could spend his own money and not being restricted from doing so by the law, but the Buckley decision struck down the preexisting limits on what Members of Congress could spend in their campaigns--the 1974 act actually had limits that Members of both the Senate and the House could spend on their campaigns based on a certain amount per voter in the State--the Court struck that down on the theory that that was an element of free speech. 
But what is the reality? The reality is that the unlimited spending that has occurred has distorted and constricted free speech. It has limited the free speech of those who don't have the money. It has undercut the other fundamental bedrock principle of our Government that everybody should have equal access to Government. All people are created equal, all created in God's image. Our rights were given to us not by Congress, but by our Creator, as it says in the first paragraph of the Declaration of Independence. That principle clearly has been compromised by the enormous sums of money people are spending in political campaigns today. 
I must also say that the testimony we heard, and I understand we didn't hear exactly a random sample of contributors of big soft money contributions, but it seemed to me, at least, that those generous contributions were not political speech in the way we normally contemplate. 
Roger Tamraz did not give $300,000 because he had a particular feeling that he wanted to express about an ideology, a candidate or a party. He was buying access. He was trying to make money. It was clear that he was willing to spend $300,000, $600,000 because he would have made hundreds of millions of dollars if his pipeline proposal had been adopted. 
Johnny Chung, Yogesh Ghandi, the whole range of people who were buying access through soft money, they were not interested in political speech as we know it, the kind of political speech that the Founders of our country established in our formative documents. 
They were buying a picture with the President to take back home, as one said, `to put powder on my face so I would look better so I could convert that into business.' They were looking to do business. They were looking to influence Government to make them richer. That is not political speech in the traditional way in which it has been known. They were advancing their interests. 
White House coffees, photo-ops with the President, breakfasts, lunches, dinners with Members of Congress--these are the things that top-dollar contributors enjoy. These are the things that are protected by the Buckley decision. These are things that we do not normally consider to be speech in the fullest sense of our democracy. 
Jefferson, I think, would be surprised--Madison, Hamilton, Adams, no matter which side they were on, in the early debates of our country's history, they would be surprised to see that it is the rights of Roger Tamraz and Johnny Chung that we are now using the first amendment to protect. The Supreme Court adopted that theory in 1976, but now we have the facts. And with the facts, I hope someday we can reverse this decision. 
I know that more than 20 State attorneys general of both parties have formed a task force to see if they can find a case to take back to the Supreme Court to relitigate the Buckley decision, because the fact is that you cannot really have contribution limits without spending limits that are effective. 
When candidates and parties are free to spend as much money as they want, they will. That is what the record shows. They will find ways to raise that money in larger and larger amounts even if it means ignoring the results and breaking the law because the stakes are enormous. Those who continue to argue for the Buckley decision are just not considering the realities of what has happened under that decision. And those realities are based on the realities of human nature and the give-and-take of today's real political world. 
Despite all of that, we have to legislate within the Buckley decision. We have to recognize that reality. Within that decision, I think the McCain-Feingold proposal, by banning soft money and regulating issue ads, does as much as we can possibly do and does a lot to put us back on course to protect the equal access to and founding principles of our Government. 
If we do not adopt something like this, I hesitate to think about what the future is going to look like. Despite all the congressional hearings, all the special investigations, all of the concern about foreign money and big money in the 1996 campaign, the fact is that while all this attention has been given, Federal Election Commission records show that the two parties have actually raised $34 million in soft money in the first half of this year, which is not less than the last comparable period, it is 2 1/2 times the $13 million raised in the 6 months after the last election. 
These numbers are going to continue to escalate, Mr. President, unless we find the courage to rein in the system, to rein in ourselves. If we face the 2000 Presidential election without any change in the law, I am afraid it is going to be the biggest auction in American history. 
What is going to be for sale is our Government. And what is going to be lost is the people's faith in public service, which will erode at ever-alarming rates unless we give them, by our actions, reason to respect the political system. Our own integrity, human as we are, full of frailties as we are, our own integrity will continue to be threatened by the pressure to spend big money in an unlimited system and the need, therefore, to raise it. 
Mr. President, the people are watching. They are skeptical. We can control temptations that inevitably arise when gigantic amounts of money are available for political campaigns. Millions of them have, in fact, given up on us and our system, bringing our great democracy I am afraid to one of the lowest points in its proud history. 
We have it within our capacity to change all this, to work together across party lines to reform the status quo of the campaign finance system, to return our politics to a higher ground and revive our citizens' trust in their Government by adopting genuine campaign finance reform like that included in the McCain-Feingold bill. 
The question remains, and it will echo throughout the debate this week and next, will we do it? Will we seize the moment or will this debate ultimately be just a lot of sound and fury that will ultimately produce nothing? 
I thank the Chair and I yield the floor.

Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Chair. I thank my friend and colleague from Indiana. I thank him particularly for his consistent leadership in this effort. I am proud to be his cosponsor along with Senator Brownback, a Republican Senator, colleague, and friend from Kansas, and--and I mention this with some pleasure--Senator Landrieu, our new colleague, Democratic Senator from Louisiana, is also a cosponsor. 
Mr. President, before I get to laying out the reasons why I am for this measure, I just want to respond to something our colleague from California said. 
The Senator from California kept stressing over and over again this foundation, this nonprofit board that we are setting up to administer these scholarships and talked about the enormous amount of money that it was going to spend--bureaucracy, overhead. In the amendment, which we are putting in to create this program, the noninstructional, the administrative costs are capped to 7.5 percent. It does come to a little bit over a half-million dollars. But take a look at the budget of the District of Columbia Public School System. Noninstructional central administration and overhead, 33 percent. Only two-thirds of the money we give--and we give well over half a billion of public money to the District of Columbia--two-thirds of that gets spent on instruction, one-third on central administration. 
The amendment Senator Coats and I are putting in caps central administration for this scholarship program at 7.5 percent. So I do not think that is a very good argument to oppose our amendment. In fact, our amendment is pretty tightly drawn where 92.5 percent of the money we give will go to the kids and the parents. Let them decide where they want it to go for their education. 
Mr. President, this is a very important amendment. There is a certain way in which a lot of us--and I am guilty of this some myself--are kind of predisposed. We go by momentum. We judge, well, which group of my friends, which interest is on which side, which interest group is on the other side. I appeal to people, our colleagues here and, frankly, particularly directly to those in my own party, to take a look at this amendment. Senator Boxer read from the amendment. 
After you read the amendment, read this: `Children in Crisis, a Report on the Failure of D.C.'s Public Schools, November 1996,' written on behalf of the District of Columbia Financial Responsibility and Management Assistance Authority, the control board we created. 
What is the conclusion? It is documented in painful--if I had a child in this system I would say infuriating, heartbreaking--detail. I quote: 
The deplorable record of the District's public schools by every important educational and management measure has left one of the city's most important public responsibilities in a state of crisis, creating an emergency which can no longer be ignored or excused. The District of Columbia Public School [System] is failing in its mission to educate the children of the District of Columbia. In virtually every area and for every grade level, the system has failed to provide our children with a quality education and a safe environment in which to learn. 
I stress the word `emergency' because I am going to come back to that word. There is an emergency in the District of Columbia Public School System and we are devoting a lot of effort--as I said before, over $500 million, $564 million in this bill, going from the Federal taxpayers to the District of Columbia Public School System. We are doing everything we can to try to make it better. What is wrong with taking $7 million, compared to the $564 million, and saying in this state of emergency, good God, let's give 2,000 kids and their parents a chance to get out of the emergency and better their own lives, better their education so they can provide for themselves? 
That is what this is about. It would do nothing more than offer 2,000 children from low-income homes the opportunity to attend a better school. Incidentally, we often don't mention it, but there is another part of it. It would offer 2,000 additional disadvantaged children of the District of Columbia, who go to the public schools and want to stay there, the opportunity for a $500 scholarship to use for exactly the kind of program Senator Boxer talked about: After-school tutoring, enrichment, the kind of program that will help that child have a better prospect of doing better, even within the tough circumstances in the District of Columbia system. That is all this is about. 
People talk about this as if, I don't know, it is un-American. It is actually fundamentally American, because it deals with equal opportunity, making it real for kids who are trapped in a school system in which, no matter how much most of them work, and their parents hope for them, they are not going to have an equal opportunity. They are not going to have the same opportunity that those many in the District of Columbia, the richer ones, who send their kids to private schools and other schools, are going to have. 
Listen to some of the critics of this amendment and you would think we were going to cause the sky to fall down on public education. Just over the last week a number of organizations that I consider to be well-intentioned have flooded the Hill with shrill letters proclaiming that this bill is discriminatory, that it is unconstitutional; possibly, from what you read, the single greatest threat to American education since I don't know what. Even Secretary of Education Richard Riley, a man I admire so much, went so far as to suggest this week that our bill would `undermine a 200-year American commitment to the common school.' 
Mr. Secretary, respectfully, that is just not so. Those of us sponsoring this amendment are having a hard time reconciling the exaggerated rhetoric of our critics with the actual details of our plan. Let me repeat. We are talking about spending $7 million next year to fund this program, compared to the $564 million we are giving to the public schools in the District. That is about two-tenths of 1 percent for this test, for this pilot program, for this lifeline to a couple of thousand disadvantaged kids in the District. We don't take one dime away from the D.C. public schools with this amendment. And this small, experimental program is purely voluntary. No people who are satisfied with their current public school will be forced to make any other choice. 
The only explanation I can come up with, after the years of listening to the wild allegations that have accompanied the school choice debate, is, if I may put it this way, that love is blind, even in public policy circles. Our critics are so committed to the noble mission of public education that they have shut their eyes to the egregious failures in so many of our public schools and insisted on defending the indefensible; insisted on blocking children in a situation that the D.C. control board describes as an emergency from getting out of that emergency. So they are conditioned to believe that any departure from their orthodoxy is tantamount to the death of their cause. They refuse to even concede the possibility that offering children this kind of choice would give them a chance at a better life while we are investing so much and working so hard nationally and here in the District to repair and reform our public schools. 
Of course our public schools will always be our priority concern when it comes to educating our children. But what about the ones who are--this is as if a child was in the middle of a fire and somebody was offering a lifeline out and somebody says, `Oh, no, no, no, the building they are in is a historic building. That is not fair to the child.' 
Listen to the complaints of some of the critics and you will see, I am afraid, that they have concocted a flexible fiction that allows them to believe this fight, their fight, is right, no matter what the facts say. In the alternative universe of the critics, money is the solution to problems that, in fact, are often created by wasteful bureaucracies. Private schools to which many choice critics themselves send their kids are not right, somehow, for children of the poor, seems to be the implication in the criticism, and giving a poor parent the same choices that heretofore have been reserved for those who can afford them amounts, somehow, to an act of discrimination instead of what it is, an act of empowerment. 
Nowhere have the myths been stretched further than in the case of this D.C. scholarship amendment. I just want to spend a few moments to recite for my colleagues some of the more spurious charges that have been made, and to respond to them. I think it is important to do so because I want to make every effort I can to make sure that Members of the Senate have accurate information about this amendment before they make up their minds on how to vote. I also hope to demonstrate the extraordinary lengths to which our critics have gone to attack this plan and uphold what I feel is a failed dogma, which is irrelevant to and insensitive to the trap in which thousands of D.C. students and their parents find themselves today: Unsafe schools--unsafe structurally and unsafe in terms of crime--where too many teachers are not actually educating the children. 
I am going to talk about some myths. 
Myth No. 1: This amendment would drain desperately needed resources from D.C. public schools. I think I have talked a bit about that, but, very briefly, the funding for our program comes from the Federal payment to the city. It would have no impact on the D.C. school budget. Put it another way, if this amendment fails, the D.C. schools will not get one additional penny. This criticism is based on the misguided notion that throwing more money at the D.C. public schools will solve the crisis they are experiencing. The truth is that the Washington Post did not label the D.C. public school system a well-financed failure for nothing. 
The Senator from California said, `Why not take the $7 million and give it to 100 percent of the children? Give it to the school system.' For what? To better finance the failure that too many of them are struggling to get an education and build a life for themselves under? 
I refer my colleagues briefly to this chart which was taken directly from that D.C. control board study that I referenced earlier. The District of Columbia Public School System in fact has one of the highest per-pupil expenditures in the country, spending an average of $1,100 more per child than cities of comparable size. Here is the District of Columbia. It spends $7,655. These are per-pupil, from 1994 and 1995--$7,655. The national average is $6,084. And look at neighboring districts, districts around the District of Columbia: $6,552. They spend slightly more than $1,000 less than the D.C. school systems spend. You can go on. The chart speaks for itself. Only Newark spends more than the District of Columbia per child. 
So it is not money here, it is the way the money is being spent. Put $7 million to 100 percent of the kids, what are you going to get? If I may build on the Washington Post conclusion, a better financed failure. Take the $7 million, give it to these 2,000--4,000 students, you are going to give them a chance at a better education and a better life. I will readily concede that the $7 million could be tacked onto the public school budget. But we have to ask ourselves, will that really help the kids who are there now, spreading the money on top of a bureaucracy that is still having trouble counting how many students it has--which is what this Control Board report tells us? Or putting it directly into the hands of 2,000 families so they can attend a school they are confident can educate their child. If we are asking what is best for the students and not what is best for the system, there is no question what will do more good right away, in this coming year, and that is the scholarship program. 
Myth No. 2, often heard about school choice and heard about this program. The scholarship is too low to pay for private school and there is no space at private schools for these kids, so it is kind of a sham. Wrong. Our critics seem to have a dated image of the universe of private and faith-based schools, one that assumes that every school is Saint Alban's or Sidwell Friends. There are 88 private and parochial schools inside the beltway that cost less than $4,000 per student, including 60 that cost less than the $3,200 scholarship our amendment would provide. There are at least 2,200 spots now open in schools with tuition less than $4,000, and that is according to just a partial survey of the schools inside the beltway. 
A related complaint we hear is the scholarships will not do much good because private and religious schools can and do discriminate. Certainly not discrimination based on race. This charge ignores what is happening today at private and parochial schools here and in other urban areas around this country. Studies show that Catholic schools, as an example, in New York and Chicago and in my own capital city of Hartford, are serving overwhelmingly minority populations. And that is more than true here in the District. This chart, I think, is a startling one. The student population of the District's 16 center-city Catholic schools is 93 percent African American. Center-city Catholic, 93 percent African-American, actually 5 percent higher than the 88 percent African-American enrollment in the public schools of the District of Columbia. Catholic schools are hardly an exception. For example, Senator Coats and I have been to visit the Nannie Helen Burroughs School, an elementary school run by the National Baptist Convention here in Washington. It is in an area in the northeast section. It has 100-percent African-American school population. We talked to the principal. She said literally they have an open-door policy. She said to Senator Coats and me, `We will accept anyone who comes to the door--anyone who comes to the door.' So much for the charge of discrimination. 
Members of the Senate should also know that this amendment contains explicit civil rights protections that would prohibit schools participating in this program from discrimination based on race, color, gender, national origin, 
and it references the District of Columbia Human Rights Act, which actually has a broader series of antidiscrimination protections. 
Myth No. 3: The voters of the District have already rejected choice. That is what the critics say. They will continue to cite the results of a referendum held--when?--17 years ago on a tuition tax credit plan totally different from the scholarship amendment Senators Coats, Brownback, Landrieu, and I are proposing here. 
A much more recent, May 1997, poll and a more relevant poll, found that 62 percent of low-income parents in the District, the people this program is designed to serve, thought a scholarship plan was an excellent or good idea. 
Mr. President, the fascinating part of that poll--I don't have the exact number in front of me--is that the more white and higher income the group polled, the more likely they were to oppose this proposal, the more likely also that their children were in private or faith-based schools. The people that this scholarship program is aimed at helping desperately want this kind of lifeline. 
Later in the debate I will cite a study done among African-Americans nationally that a joint center, distinguished think tank, in town shows remarkable rising support for school choice programs, vouchers, particularly among younger African-Americans. I wonder why, sadly, too many African American children are suffering from a lack of real opportunity in school systems like the one in the District of Columbia. 
Myth No. 4: There is no evidence, the critics say, that scholarships will improve academic performance. Well, just a few days ago, a research team from Harvard released a study showing that students participating in the Cleveland choice program made significant gains in their first year. Math test scores rose an average 15 percent in 1 year for kids involved in the choice program there; reading tests 5 percent--just 1 year after leaving public schools. 
That data builds on several convincing studies demonstrating that low-income students attending center-city Catholic schools have achieved far higher scores than their peer groups in the local public schools. Comparable populations in each case, two different settings, kids in the center-city Catholic schools doing much better. 
A 1990 Rand Corp. comparison of schools in New York City, for instance, found that the Catholic schools graduated 95 percent of their students annually, while the comparable public schools graduated slightly more than 50 percent. These are numbers, but behind these numbers are thousands of children--thousands of children--who, when they don't finish school, are generally confined to a life without real opportunity. 
Look at the difference: 95 percent of the kids in the Catholic schools graduate; slightly more than 50 percent in the comparable public schools. 
The Rand Corp. report also showed that the Catholic school students outperformed their counterparts in the public schools and--again, this is in New York City--on the SAT exam by an average of 160 points. 
A study released earlier this year by Derek Neal of the University of Chicago found that low-income Catholic school students were twice as likely to graduate from college as their public school counterparts. What a story. It shows what we all know; it shows it so powerfully. 
The problem here is not the kids. Put the kids in an environment where they have a real chance to learn, where they are going to be taught in a way that is focused on them, and they will blossom, they will rise, they will soar, with twice as many graduating from college. Not surprising, then, that Paul Vallas, the man charged with rebuilding the decrepit Chicago Public School System, and doing a great job from all reports, is working closely with educators in the schools of the Catholic Archdiocese of Chicago to learn what has made these faith-based schools succeed where the public schools have failed. It is surprising, though, that few other urban administrators have been willing to do the same thing. 
Myth No. 5, another false allegation: This amendment is part of a Republican-only agenda. It is a sad fact that most of the choice proponents in Congress are members of the Republican Party, although I am proud to say that Senator Landrieu and I are cosponsors of this amendment, and in the House, Congressman Floyd Flake of New York and Congressman Bill Lipinski of Chicago have joined in cosponsoring this bill. 
But you have to go beyond that. To write this effort off as a partisan effort is to ignore the growing demand for programs that give parents greater educational choice, a demand that cuts across partisan, racial, class, and ideological lines. 
Take a look at who is driving the choice movement at the grassroots level around the country. Mothers like Zakiya Courtney in Milwaukee and Barbara Lewis in Indianapolis. Educators like Howard Fuller, the former Milwaukee superintendent of schools. Legislators like Glenn Lewis from Texas. Civil rights leaders like Alveda King from Atlanta, Dolores Fridge, the Minnesota Commissioner of Human Rights. 
All happen to be African-Americans. To the best of my knowledge, most of them are Democrats. 
They are not moved by politics. What moves them is love for their children and frustration and anger that their children are being denied a chance at the American dream because they are being forced, for reasons of income, to attend chronically dysfunctional public schools. 
These activists have been joined by thoughtful thinkers, independents like Bill Raspberry and Democrats like Bill Galston, former domestic policy adviser to President Clinton, who have both endorsed the program that we are proposing in this amendment today. 
Consider the fact that polls routinely show that support for just the kind of program we are proposing is growing into a majority. For example, just this week, the Center for Education Reform released a survey showing that 82 percent of American adults favored giving parents greater educational choice, and 72 percent approve of using taxpayer funds to allow poor parents to choose a better school for their child--72 percent on a poll released just this week. 
This is not partisan. Unfortunately, the vote in Congress too often has been divided along party lines, but that is not the reality out across America. Why? Because the American people are fair, they are realistic, they are practical. They see what is happening to too many of the children in too many of our public school systems. While we are working feverishly to repair those school systems, they think some of the kids are trapped in them, not because they are less able, but only because their parents don't have the money to take them out of those school systems that aren't working for them. 
The parents and activists and local political leaders who are demanding choices are not out to destroy the public schools, as so often is alleged. Senator Coats and I, Senator Brownback, Senator Landrieu--none of us are out to destroy the public schools. I am the proud product of a public school. I received a great education. I know the role that the public school has played in America as a blender, a meeting ground for people of all kinds who come to the public schools. But the reality is, in too many of our schools today, that is not happening. 
Mr. President, I can't think of a public school education support proposal that I haven't supported in the 8 1/2 years I have been in the Senate of the United States. IDEA, special education funding, School to Work Act, the President's national testing initiative, charter school programs, funding, more and more funding for the public schools. What the critics fail to realize is that you can support this scholarship program and support public education. This is not an either/or equation. 
In fact, Senator Brownback and I, particularly as the Chair and ranking member of the Senate D.C. oversight committee, are working constantly with General Becton, now the head of the D.C. Public School System, to give him real support in meeting the overwhelming challenge he has of resuscitating the D.C. school system. 
I repeat, again, the very bill on which we are aiming to attach this amendment provides $564 million, over one-half billion dollars of money from the taxpayers of the United States for the D.C. Public School System. General Becton himself concedes that the D.C. public schools--he said this before our committee--will not get better really to where he wants them to be for at least 5 or 10 years. They are going to get better along the way. He said, `Don't expect an overnight miracle here. I am not going to reach what you want to make of the school system for another 5 or 10 years.' 
What do we tell the children who are in the school system in the meantime, and what do we tell their parents? That in the name of some ideology, for some reason of history, to protect the ideal of the public school system as some of us experienced it that doesn't have any realistic relationship to what is happening every day for thousands of kids in the District of Columbia, in the name of preserving public education, that we as adults are willing to sacrifice children's futures, the kids who are there now, in a system described by the control board as in a state of emergency? We are willing to sacrifice them for the sake of a process, an idea that is not real in their lives? Go into the District school system, go into the schools and see what kids face. It is not acceptable, and that is why we are pushing so hard to establish this scholarship program. 
Senator Coats and I and the other cosponsors are not suggesting that this is the cure-all for the city's educational woes, but it will give 4,000 kids from disadvantaged families, not kids who are not able, kids who have the same God-given ability as any other group of kids, it will give them the opportunity to realize that ability and a better life. It will make a statement that we are not going to tolerate the unacceptable status quo any longer. 
In the long run, it will, hopefully, increase the positive pressure on the public schools to become more accountable, to raise their standards, to win back the public's confidence. Mr. President, later in the debate, if there is time, I am going to read from an affidavit filed by a member of the Milwaukee school system in a school choice case where that member testified to the positive competitive effect that the school choice program in Milwaukee had on the public schools. 
For all this, Senator Coats and the other cosponsors and I are accused of leaving behind or abandoning the 76,000 children who would not have access to the scholarship program. The irony, of course, is that just the opposite is true. Too many of these children have already been abandoned by a school system that has been driven into the ground by too much incompetence, too much indifference to the best interests of the city's families, a system that is so bad that the control board report that I mentioned earlier concludes something that I had to look at two or three times to understand:  
The longer students stay in the District's Public School System, the less likely they are to succeed educationally. 
I couldn't believe that. `The longer students stay in the District's Public School System, the less likely they are to succeed educationally.' I went back. What does that mean? It means as the grade levels go up, the District school kids fall further and further below the national average on standardized tests. 
To continue to do nothing, other than to call for more money, while these children suffer is unfair to these children. 
That is why the onus should not be on us to defend our plan or alternative, our scholarships, but on those who oppose doing anything that does not fit inside the box of status quo public education which is failing thousands of children here in the District of Columbia. 
We have to ask, what are you willing to do to change things right now? What are we willing to do to rescue these kids who must go to schools that have more metal detectors than computers? To continue to do nothing out of fear of being divisive or offending one or another group is irresponsible. And, you know, that is a major argument against this amendment, that it is divisive. Those who opposed the civil rights laws when they were first proposed also liked to complain that those being proposed were going to be divisive and thereby damaging to the country. It was an unconvincing argument then just as it is now. 
Mr. President, it is a remarkable twist of fate that we stand debating this amendment, as I am sure my colleagues have seen in the news today, on the 40th anniversary of the desegregation of a Little Rock high school, Central High School. President Clinton will be down there this weekend to commemorate that historic event. Of course, that school was desegregated and other schools were saved from legal segregation. 
But what is the reality today? Too many schools are still effectively segregated, but really more fundamentally to the point, too many children are being denied the equal opportunity for an education that the desegregation movement, that Brown versus Board of Education, that all the tumult that followed it was all about. 
The kids in the District school system do not have a real equal opportunity to an education. And that is what our amendment is all about. 
Mr. President, finally, I want to make a plea to the Members of my own party. If I may be partisan in this sense, this Democratic Party of ours in its modern expression was built on a central principle, equal opportunity, building on the bedrock insight that the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution have, that everybody is created equal, and that these are inalienable rights that we have, incidentally not given to us by the founders of the country or by Congress or any other group but given to us by our Creator. 
The Democratic Party in the modern history of this country has focused on making this ideal of equal opportunity real. At our best we have been the party of upward mobility, we have been the party that welcomed people to this country, immigrants to this country. We have stood for giving everybody a fair chance to go up. Getting a decent education was at the heart of that. 
That ultimately is what is at the heart of this debate--basic fairness, equal opportunity. The reality is that we already have de facto educational choice in this country. It is just limited to those who can pay for it. The question we now face is, whether we make that kind of choice available to the children who really need it most or whether we continue to deny them the opportunity out of some fear of upsetting the status quo or some interest groups who support the status quo. 
I urge my Democratic colleagues to think about why they became Democrats, what the party is all about, and how, when we think about that, how they can oppose scholarships for 4,000 poor children. Nothing mandatory. Parents have the right to apply for this. Where have we come when we end up in that position that we are denying a lifeline to 4,000 poor children in the District of Columbia? 
I urge my colleagues to take a look at the final chart I am going to show, which is this one. Ward 3 in the District, the upper northwest part of the District; 65 percent of the families send their children to private schools. So 65 percent of the families send their children to private schools; the poverty rate is 6 percent. Well, look. That is the most, of course, of any ward in the city. 
Look at Ward 1, a poverty rate of 17 percent; only 11 percent can send their kids to private school. Ward 7, the poverty rate is 18 percent; only 7 percent can send their kids to private school. It is clear what is going on here. And 65 percent of the families from Ward 3 sending their kids to private school is six times the national average. Probably some Members of this Senate are in that statistic in Ward 3. 
We have to ask ourselves, is it fair, given the factual indictment of the status quo of the D.C. public schools--which, as I said, over and over again today, we are spending a half a billion dollars and working with General Becton in all sorts of ways to fix it--is it fair for us to force the disenfranchised, not by reason of law, not by reason of the God-given potential of each and every one of their children, are we going to force them to go to schools that we ourselves, and in fact that statistics show that most D.C. public schoolteachers, will not risk sending their own children to? 
I say to my colleagues, as you wrestle with that question, I want to leave you with the wisdom of a Nigerian proverb that I 
saw on the wall of a D.C. school that I visited recently. It said, `To not know is bad; to not want to know is worse.' We can no longer profess not to know about what is happening to thousands of children in the D.C. public school system today who the superintendent of the school system says are in a school system that will not be what we want it to be for 5 or 10 years. 
We cannot profess any longer not to know this reality. Therefore, for us not to act now, frankly, is not to want to know. And the terror of that is that for that willful ignorance, it is these children who are going to pay the price. So I have spoken strongly here today because I feel strongly about this. 
Mr. President, this is about kids, this is about their future, this is about the reality of the American dream for those who have the hardest time of reaching for it. This is a small program--$7 million--to try it out. 
Hey, can anybody say that things are so good in the District of Columbia Public School System that it is not worth experimenting with an alternative for a couple of years? No. I hope my colleagues will think about this and will face the reality and will give this scholarship program a chance, which is to say, that they will give 4,000 children in the District of Columbia a chance that they will otherwise not have. 
I thank the Chair and yield the floor.

Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise to address Senator Reed's amendment to S. 830, the FDA reform bill. The proponents of the amendment have failed to distinguish between devices that are substantially equivalent to devices the FDA has approved and devices for which no predicate exists. That distinction is central to the regulatory scheme for device approval. 
Most medical devices brought to the market represent a small incremental change. Around 95% of medical device approvals granted by the FDA involve devices that are substantially equivalent to a device already approved by the agency. 
Most devices are not breakthroughs. They are not devices with bold new uses. They do not represent a sharp departure in medical science. They are devices with a foundation of testing, experience in the field, and most important, devices with a foundation in previous FDA approval. 
Policies and regulations that are appropriate for devices without a predicate are not appropriate where devices are substantially equivalent to a device that has already received the FDA stamp of approval. If each new device represented such a break with the past, it would be sensible to fully reexamine safety and efficacy every time FDA was asked to grant approval. 
But in a world of small changes, this unwarranted bureaucratic impediment would strangle progress, limit the benefits available to the public from technological advances, and yield little if any public health benefit. 
To capture the public health benefits of small incremental change, such devices are approved by the FDA under special procedures called the 510(K) approval process. The critical test applied by the FDA in approving the device is demonstrating that the device is substantially equivalent to a device that has already been approved by the agency. The test of substantial equivalence is a flexible definition that includes both products that are identical to previously approved devices, and those with a certain degree of technological change. 
In contrast, where the new device represents a major advance and is used in supporting life or avoiding substantial impairment of health, the FDA uses entirely different tests before approving the device. These breakthrough devices undergo extensive safety and effectiveness trials before marketing. They require extensive premarket review because the FDA has no assurance the new device is safe and effective based on studies of a previous device, field experience, or FDA approval. 
Approving substantially equivalent products expeditiously allows the FDA to concentrate its resources on those devices that involve new technologies or uses rather than waste time and staff conducting full-blown reviews of the equivalent device again and again and again. 
In the example we have heard so much about over the last few days, U.S. Surgical Corp: which is headquartered in my State--submitted an application for approval of an advanced breast biopsy instrumentation device in October 5, 1995. The application was granted by the FDA on February 1, 1996. The FDA based their approval on substantial equivalence in design, materials, methods of use, and intended use to biopsy needles the FDA had previously approved. Since that date the ABBI device has been used in over 7,000 cases worldwide. 
In granting approval to U.S. Surgical, the FDA applied the two statutory tests of substantial equivalence. First, the device was shown to have `the same intended use as the predicate device' and second, `the same technological characteristics as the predicate device'. 
Some Members have mistakenly stated that U.S. Surgical has marketed the device to remove breast cancer tumors, but the Members are in error. 
A degree of technological variation is permissible and specifically envisioned in the statute. Where the device has different technological characteristics, it can still be approved under 510(K) if the manufacturer submits  
* * * information, including clinical data if deemed necessary by the Secretary, that demonstrates that the device is as safe and effective as a legally marketed device, and does not raise different questions of safety and efficacy than the predicate device. 
ABBI uses a larger cannula than previously approved biopsy needles. The wide cannula allows the physician to extract a broader sample of breast tissue. The wide cross section allows more accurate diagnosis of breast lesions that appear in the x-ray as clusters of tiny particles rather than discrete nodes. 
U.S. Surgical's product insert states in boxed, large type `The ABBI* system is to be used ONLY for diagnostic breast biopsy; it is NOT a therapeutic device.' Its patient pamphlet on the device discusses biopsy uses to the exclusion of any other potential use. 
In the ABBI example, the FDA requested clinical data from U.S. Surgical about impact of the new technology, broader cannula. U.S. Surgical submitted the data on September 23, 1996 and the FDA updated the 510(K). 
The sponsors of the amendment state that manufacturers have an incentive to seek approval based on false and misleading statements of intended uses. Under the 510 (K) approval process, the device must have the `same intended use as the predicate device' but the amendment sponsors state that manufacturers are able to undercut this test. The amendment sponsors suggest that the FDA be allowed to establish a new intent test for 510(K) approvals that allows the FDA to impute new uses, demand new safety and efficacy tests, and ignore the manufacturers intended uses. 
First, I would point out that U.S. Surgical specifically responded to the FDA's concerns by adding new labeling to its device clearly stating that the device was to be used `only for diagnostic breast biopsy'. 
Second, the FDA already has ample power to confront potential problems in labeling. For example, they sent a warning letter to the U.S. Surgical Corp., on June 3, 1996, regarding labeling and advertising claims made for the ABBI. The warning letter lead to the modifications in labeling and resubmission of the 510(K) application. 
Finally, the FDA has a host of criminal and civil penalties to prevent the marketing of mislabeled products including administrative detention and seizure, criminal and civil penalties, injunction, mandatory consumer and physician mandatory notifications, mandatory recall, and adverse agency publicity. 
For example, FDA can administratively detain devices that are misbranded based on FDA's unilateral determination that a detention is appropriated, and can last up to 30 days to permit the agency an opportunity to either perfect a civil seizure through the courts or obtain injunctive relief. 
Into the middle of this, the Reed amendment would throw a major change. The amendment does not state grounds or procedures by which the FDA would determine that the proposed labeling was `false' or `misleading'. The evidentiary basis by which the FDA will impute the manufacturers intent is unknown, as is the frequency of off-label uses that spurs additional FDA requirements or the adequacy of additional clinical trials necessary to satisfy their concerns. If the amendment passes, manufacturers have to be prepared to conduct trials of safety and efficacy for uses they are not seeking. Furthermore, the additional requirements only apply to the unapproved device--not to the predicate device previously approved by the FDA. 
The 510(K) process is intended to provide an expedited basis for bringing new versions of previously approved products to the market. It employs relatively simple and easy to apply tests of substantial equivalence. The tests are straight forward and predictable in their application. We should continue to protect this path of technological innovation. The FDA has ample power to prevent mislabeled products from endangering the public health. If the amendment passes, many innovative devices will not be available to consumers and the public health will suffer.

Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise in strong opposition to the amendment offered by Senator Hutchinson that would have severe consequences for President Clinton's American heritage rivers initiative. 
The American heritage rivers initiative is designed to support community efforts on behalf of their own river resources and will help these communities tell the rest of the Nation just how special their river is. The Federal Government has a lot of expertise to offer to local communities on how to accomplish that goal, and we ought to be looking for ways to share that wealth with communities who want it. I wanted to take a moment to explain why I think the initiative is the right way to accomplish these goals. 
The initiative involves no new regulatory requirements for individuals or State, tribal, and local governments. It is a voluntary, community-defined effort that gives riverbank communities the option to work in partnership with the Government to help cut redtape and match community priorities with services provided by Federal agencies. The initiative will allow communities to partner voluntarily with the Federal Government so that existing resources can be used more effectively. In this time of increasingly scarce funding, this is certainly worth encouraging. 
Individuals, communities, and organizations already working in the watershed will define the partnership and determine the support they want from the Federal Government to conserve river resources and build the watershed economy. This initiative isn't a land grab by the Federal Government, or even a potential one. It is simply an effort to help sustain and renew river communities, and recognize the rich history and tremendous contributions of rivers to the Nation. 
Second, safeguards are in place to ensure that the initiative will protect the interests of river communities. Most importantly, nominations for designation as an American heritage river must come from the communities themselves. Unless a community wants an American heritage river, they don't have to have one. And there are opportunities to designate only stretches of river in case the local communities feel that designation of the entire river would be appropriate. 
The nominations themselves must meet several criteria that demonstrate designation is not going to interfere with anyone's interests. For example, the nomination must have broad support from individuals and organizations along the river. This means that a river won't be designated unless it makes sense to the community--the people who are closest to the resource and understand it best--that this action will be beneficial. Also, the nomination must show that the different interests who live in the community--public, private, and local government groups--are willing to cooperate to protect the river. 
Now what happens if a river receives an American heritage designation? The Federal Government simply makes a commitment to use existing staff, resources and programs to assist river communities in their river restoration and community revitalization efforts. These are relatively simple services but can be essential for local communities struggling to gain the attention of the Federal Government. For example, an Internet Home Page will be set up to provide communities with information on river conditions and where to access other kinds of information important to the interests of the community such as available grants, and where to get aerial photographs and advice from experts. This kind of non-intrusive assistance will help to streamline the bureaucracy that can be encountered when communities plan initiatives to revitalize their surroundings. A commitment to a better-functioning government is in everyone's interests. In addition, this isn't a perpetual designation--any community may have this designation terminated at its request at any point in the future. 
If a river receives the American heritage designation, the Federal Government agrees to act as a `good neighbor' to those communities involved. This means that the Federal Government will ensure that its actions have a positive effect on the natural, historical, economic, and cultural resources of the river communities. Agencies will be required to identify ways to inform local groups regarding Federal actions and must consult with American heritage river communities early in the planning stages of those actions to take into account the communities' goals and objectives. Communities also will be granted greater flexibility to try out new and innovative approaches that support their needs. Reducing the bureaucratic obstacles communities face and committing the Government to plan around the communities' objectives means that the Federal Government will be more responsive to the needs of local areas--something we all want. The initiative will allow riverbank communities to build their watershed economy and conserve their river resources in better, smarter ways than might be possible currently. 
In New England, communities along the Northeast's longest river and largest river system--the Connecticut River--are sold on the American heritage rivers Initiative. The Connecticut traverses four States from its headwaters in New Hampshire to Long Island Sound and affects millions of lives and livelihoods in the States through which it flows. Unfortunately, the Connecticut faces problems that State and local governments cannot resolve alone--run-off from lawn care and agricultural fertilizers and discharges from sewage treatment plants pour into the river. Some fish contain unhealthful levels of toxins. Sewers overflow into the river when it rains. A network of ready-and-willing groups up and down the river want to work in partnership with the Federal Government to help the Connecticut. These include State and local conservation and historic preservation groups, local businesses, hydropower dam operators, regional planning commissions, and urban revitalization efforts. Designation of the river as an American heritage river would benefit every regional, state, and local effort to promote the Connecticut River Valley as a place of unmatched quality, where there is an opportunity to raise a family, expand a business, or spend a vacation. 
Rivers are a cornerstone of this Nation's great history and define the distinctive character of riverfront communities. Rivers are lifelines that rank among our greatest environmental, economic, and human resources. What we say and do in caring for all our rivers will say to future generations not what we think about ourselves here in 1997, but what we want the world to be for our grandchildren, and their grandchildren. The American heritage rivers Initiative will help ensure that our legacy to future generations reflects our commitment to work together to conserve and restore the environment, to protect cultural and historical resources, and to promote responsible economic development and tourism on our Nation's most important assets. The initiative deserves out support. I urge opposition to Senator Hutchinson's amendment.

 Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise today in sadness at the great crisis which threatens to end the Oslo Peace Process in the Middle East. The crisis, as we know, has been caused by the most recent cowardly and criminal acts of those who are enemies of not only the peace process but of the Israeli and Palestinian people themselves. 
My hope is that a solution to the crisis may be found through the ingenuity, faith, and the actions of those who have the courage to rise above hatred and suspicion. It is for that reason and in that spirit that I wish to express my strongest support for the mission of Secretary of State Albright to the Middle East this week. 
The recent bombings in Jerusalem were detestable acts of terrorism which had only one purpose--killing the peace process. Both Israelis and Palestinians alike will be the victims if the criminals succeed. 
Secretary Albright's mission is nothing less than an attempt to save the peace process. But the peace process can recover and move forward only in a secure environment, and the Secretary has properly identified security as the primary and essential focus of her trip. This, I must emphasize, must be transparently as important to the Palestinian Authority as it is to the Government of Israel. Those that have planned and carried out these acts of terrorism against Israel have at the same time weakened the Palestinian Authority. 
Chairman Arafat and the Palestinian Authority must address this problem at its root and without equivocation. The coordination of security efforts is not and cannot be a bargaining chip to be turned on or off at will. There can be no tolerance for the perpetrators of violence--those who plan, finance, supply, or abet terrorism must be arrested, prosecuted, and imprisoned. No exceptions and no revolving doors. 
Prime Minister Netanyahu has stated that there can be no peace without security. This is a commitment we share, and a commitment that must be evidenced by the Palestinian Authority beyond question through its own unilateral actions. At the same time, and as noted by Secretary Albright, we do not ask the impossible and, against suicide terrorists, cannot expect 100-percent success. There must, however, be nothing other than a 100-percent effort in this regard by the leadership of the Palestinian Authority. 
With this security perspective as the foundation, there must also be a political environment that makes it possible to rebuild the trust that has been a victim of the violence and move ahead to achieve a peace for all. Prime Minister Netanyahu has expressed his commitment to `a peace that will surprise the world.' We must encourage all parties to embrace such a commitment, and I fully support the Secretary in her efforts to that end.

Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank my friend and colleague from New York for yielding and for his statement. 
Mr. President, as a result of a terrorist act, blood has been spilled in the streets of Israel as its citizens go about the most normal day-to-day tasks, walking, shopping. Lives again have been lost to the terrorist hand. It is a very sad and dispiriting moment, not just, of course, for those who have suffered in this terrorist attack and for the families and friends who pray now that the lives of the wounded will be saved. It is also a sad and dispiriting day for all of us who hope for the continuation of the peace process in the Middle East, 
begun in Oslo, ratified at a historic, dramatic, hopeful signing on the lawn of the White House on September 13, 1993 by the late Prime Minister Rabin and Chairman Arafat. The agreement, the understanding, the exchange made in the declaration of principles in the Oslo accord was complicated in one sense, but simple in another. It was an exchange in which the Israeli Government would yield land in recognition of a Palestinian self-governing authority in exchange for the Palestinians--and particularly their eventually elected leadership, Chairman Arafat and others--giving security to the people of Israel; freedom from fear of the kind of terrorist acts that have been committed again today in Israel. 
Mr. President, I know the Prime Minister of Israel, Benjamin Netanyahu, is controversial in many areas of this country, and there are different acts that he has carried out as a leader that some challenge and question. But it seems to me, if you look at the agreement made in the Oslo accords and you look at what was required of Israel, Prime Minister Netanyahu, since he has been Prime Minister, has kept those promises made by Prime Minister Rabin. The same cannot be said of Chairman Arafat. 
It is not just, although it is significant, the failure, as promised in the Oslo accord, to remove from the Palestinian Charter these clauses which threaten the destruction of the State of Israel. It is not just, though of course it is tragic and painful, the terrorist acts that continue. But it is the tone, it is the context of what is happening. The Israeli intelligence gathers evidence, presents it to Mr. Arafat to show him, a month or so ago, that the person he has appointed as the chief of the Palestinian Authority police has been involved in planning terrorist acts. How would we feel if we had evidence from intelligence showing that the minister of defense of Russia, with whom we were negotiating an arms control agreement, had been involved in planning terrorist acts against the United States? The dreadful moment, after the bombing in Israel, in Jerusalem, a few months ago, Chairman Arafat, instead of taking action to reassure the fear of average Israelis about their security, holds a conference with Hamas and other terrorist groups and embraces and kisses one of the leaders of that group. Again, the chief of police of the Palestinian Authority at one point declares with some pride that more than 100 members of Hamas are members of the Palestinian Authority police. 
The effect of these actions leading, again, to this tragic terrorist act today, is not just to affect the political leadership of Israel. Israel is a democracy. That is why Mr. Netanyahu is Prime Minister. The effect of these acts that I have described is to undercut severely the trust, the confidence, the hope of the people of Israel for peace. Because they don't trust the Palestinian Authority and Mr. Arafat, based on these various acts I have described and Senator D'Amato has described, to carry out the promises in the Oslo accords to provide security and peace. 
The late Yitzhak Rabin, Prime Minister of Israel, was a great leader, a great soldier of the peace, so-called peace of the brave. But I would say today, if Prime Minister Rabin was alive and was still Prime Minister today, he could not accept the continuation of the peace process under the status quo, because the Palestinians have not kept their part of the bargain. So, I fully support the statements made by the Senator from New York. I am grateful the Secretary of State is underway to the Middle East. It will take a courageous and bold action. But the main point here is that Chairman Arafat has to understand---

Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, what I am saying here is that this process--for the first time since September 1993 I fear that the peace process in the Middle East is unraveling. And that would be a terrible result for the people on both sides in the Middle East. The only way it can be brought back on track is for Chairman Arafat to take some unequivocal and strong actions to make clear that he is an enemy of terrorism. That will probably include arresting suspected terrorists. That will include a direct break of this embrace with Hamas. It will include a dedication to destroying the terrorist infrastructure that is part of Hamas. If that does not happen, the process will not go forward. Because the people of Israel--leave aside the Government--the people of Israel will not have the confidence to take it forward. 
Here our options are limited. The Secretary of State and her designees are there to try to bring some sense to the parties on both sides. But, insofar as we have options, it suffices to say that in the climate and the reality that has occurred, as Senator D'Amato has indicated, it seems to me there is very little chance that this Congress would appropriate any funds for the Palestinian Authority. It will make it difficult to renew the Middle East Peace Facilitation Act, which allowed the PLO, the Palestinian Authority, to have an office here in Washington which was closed in August because we didn't renew it. 
These are serious consequences which go to the heart of the process and to the hopes of people, on the Palestinian and Israeli sides, for a better future than the war-torn past. I think we are all here appealing to Chairman Arafat, who remains the elected chairman, to seize this moment, show his leadership, or forever be seen in the eyes of history as the man who destroyed the hopes for peace in the Middle East. 
I thank the Chair and yield the floor.

Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I am proud to rise today to offer an amendment, along with my good friend and colleague Senator Coats from Indiana, which would increase our investment in one of the most promising engines of education reform in America today, which is the charter school movement. This amendment would increase funding for the charter school grant program from the current level of $51 million up to $100 million for fiscal year 1998. 
Mr. President, we recognize that this is a sizable jump in funding, but let me put it in context and then go on to explain why we believe it is more than warranted. 
Earlier this week, on Tuesday of this week, my friend and mentor, Bill Bennett, wrote a column on the op-ed page of the Wall Street Journal in which he began with some startling numbers. `This morning,' that is Tuesday morning, `a record 52 million children will walk into America's classrooms. And this year Americans will spend more than a quarter of a trillion dollars trying to educate them.' 
So when we think, as this amendment would do, Mr. President, of taking the $51 million the Federal Government now invests in charter schools and raising it to $100 million--a sizable jump; just about doubling it--let us put it in the broader context of the quarter of a trillion dollars that is being spent every year in this country to educate our children. This additional $50 million, I think, provides enormous hope that the remaining quarter of a trillion dollars will be better spent. 
Dr. Bill Bennett went on to say that these numbers alone ensure that education will be at or near the top of the national political agenda, and indeed, in addition to this, there is greater political emphasis on social issues. Education is how many people talk about the condition of our children, cultural decline, and the Nation's moral well-being. 
Dr. Bennett goes on to cite a number of hopeful signs of reform and progress occurring in our education system, including some of the superb experiments that are now being tried with school choice or school vouchers, school scholarships. But he also mentions charter schools. I quote from his article. `Public schools that are freed from many regulations, in exchange for greater autonomy and more accountability, are flourishing. There are now more than 700 charter schools in 28 States.' 
Mr. President, the goal of this amendment is to help us open, help the States, help individuals, help entrepreneurs open hundreds of more charter schools. This movement has quickly become one of the most popular and encouraging developments in the world of education reform. Since the first charter school opened in Minnesota in 1991, 29 States and the District of Columbia have enacted charter programs. And as children head back to school this month, it is expected that more than 700 charter schools will be in operation across the country, including a whole new group in my own State of Connecticut, practically tripling the number of charters that were in existence just 2 years ago. 
The appeal of this new breed of schools is obvious. In the context of a school system that is not adequately educating too many of our children, charters offer the promise of higher standards, greater accountability, broader flexibility to innovate in the classroom, and ultimately greater choice, which is what more and more parents want in public education. So far the broad array of charter schools already in business are delivering on that potential. Parents give overwhelmingly high marks to charter schools for their responsiveness to them, the parents, as customers. Several independent studies show that this, in turn, is helping to generate greater parental involvement in the education of their children. 
These studies also show that charters are effectively serving diverse populations, particularly many of the disadvantaged and at-risk children that traditional public schools have struggled to reach. While it is too soon to determine what impact charter schools are having on overall academic performance, the early returns in places like Massachusetts suggest that charters are succeeding where it matters most, in the classroom. 
Perhaps the most powerful endorsement of the charter school approach came recently from the superintendent of public schools for the Seattle public school district, who suggested that the city should consider making every school in its district a charter school, freeing the schools of the burdens of the central bureaucracy, setting a series of standards of accountability that would have to be met by those who run the school in a given amount of time and understanding that the charter is not forever. The charter is only renewed if the goals set out within it are realized. 
The movement is being driven by a growing legion of parents, educators, business leaders and community activists who are convinced that alternatives in public education, including charter schools, represent the future of public education in America. But Congress, to our credit, has made a valuable contribution to the growth of charters through the Federal charter grant program, which was authorized in 1994 with broad bipartisan support. 
I was privileged to be a cosponsor of that legislation with Senator David Durenberger, the main sponsor, Senator from Minnesota. 
Over the last 3 years, the Federal charter program has helped scores of charter schools open. What do we do? We defray the costs many groups face in trying to start a school from scratch. That is what the Federal money goes to. Most States provide charter schools, and this is the case in Connecticut, with a per pupil allotment once they are in operation. But charter operators have to scramble to cover such startup expenses as planning a curriculum, leasing a building, hiring a staff. 
A survey of charter school operators recently conducted by the Department of Education highlighted this problem showing that it was by far the biggest obstacle to success that charter school operators face. It is that obstacle that this amendment intends to diminish. 
As the charter movement expands, the demand for this aid will only continue to grow with it. With the number of charter schools mushrooming each year, our ability to help them meet their startup costs will quickly diminish, unless we increase the amount appropriated, as this amendment would do. 
President Clinton recognized this when he issued a challenge in the State of the Union to double the funding for the Federal charter program. That is what we do, Senator Coats and I, in this amendment. 
By doubling funding for this program, we would help scores of new charter schools make the transition from the drawing board to the blackboard, and provide thousands of additional students with an opportunity to attend one of these innovative, performance-based programs. Moreover, we would also send a strong message to charter advocates and to families in general that the Federal Government is committed to supporting the good work that is happening at the State and local level and that we are serious about fundamentally improving public education. 
To make sure we spend this new money wisely, Senator Coats and I also intend to introduce legislation this fall aimed at strengthening the Federal charter program. From our experience to date, we have learned some valuable lessons about how we can improve this program to speed the development of charter schools in participating States and to also encourage nonparticipating States to join this movement. The legislation we're preparing would use the new Federal funding to reward those States that are most actively moving to create charters. It would also tighten a few unintended loopholes in the current law that have allowed schools that are not true charters to receive Federal aid that was not intended for them. 
We can begin strengthening this program immediately by increasing our investment in charter schools. And that is the purpose of our amendment today. To pay for this new investment, we are proposing shifting a relatively small amount of funds from three broad-based Federal programs--the title VI block grant account, Goals 2000, and the Fund for the Improvement of Education. All three of these programs are aimed at promoting educational reform and innovation, which is the same exact mission of the charter school program. So in essence, rather than cutting these three broad-based accounts, our amendment would simply earmark a fixed portion for a highly effective, well-targeted, and broadly supported program. 
The three programs from which we are shifting funding are all worthwhile efforts. But we feel strongly by earmarking a relatively small amount from them for the charter school program, we will be getting the most bang for the books. 
We are convinced that the charter movement, as charter expert Bruno Manno of the Hudson Institute has said, is arguably the most vibrant force in public education today. It has managed to bring together parents, educators, and political leaders from both parties in support of an effort to inject more choice, accountability, and competition into our public schools, an effort that focuses first and foremost on performance, not process--performance in educating our children. 
I hope we can come together ourselves in a bipartisan fashion, as we did in launching the Federal charter program, to demonstrate our commitment to these goals by passing this amendment. I thank the managers of the bill for the opportunity to speak on this important issue, and would ask them for their support. 
Mr. President, let me discuss the funding offsets for the Lieberman-Coats charter school amendment. 
The Lieberman-Coats amendment would increase funding for the Federal charter school grant program by $49 million. Here is a breakdown of how this amendment is paid for: $25 million would come from the title VI block grant program that supports State and local driven innovation efforts. This would leave funding for this account at $285 million; $14 million would come from the Goals 2000 program. This would leave funding for this account at $515.9 million, which would still amount to a $25 million increase over the fiscal year 1997 level; and $10 million would come from the Fund for the Improvement of Education, a pool of discretionary funds administered by the Secretary of Education. This would leave funding for this account at $40 million, the same amount appropriated for fiscal year 1997. 
All of these programs are broad-based efforts aimed at promoting education reform and innovation and lifting standards. The charter school program is dedicated to these same goals. So rather than cutting the three programs listed above, the Lieberman-Coats amendment simply earmarks a fixed portion of these accounts for arguably the most promising education reform and innovation initiative in the country. 
I notice the presence on the floor of my cosponsor and Senator Stevens as well. I yield the floor.

 Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the Chester Hose Company on their 85th anniversary. On September 7 they will be honored by the town of Chester and the Chester Historical Society with a Chester Hose Company Day celebration. 
For the past 85 years this dedicated group of men and women have strived to ensure the safety of the community of Chester, CT. Their dedication is evident in their unshakable commitment to self-sacrifice for the security of their friends, families, and neighbors. Indeed, some have given the ultimate sacrifice, giving their lives while trying to protect their fellow citizens. 
This organization's dedication and commitment to the town of Chester can be seen not only through the company's actions, but also in the great confidence and respect the residents of Chester place in these men and women. These are ordinary citizens asked to perform extraordinary tasks, and never asking what was in it for them. The community's faith in their company has not wavered in its first 85 years and will undoubtedly continue through the next century. 
The Chester Hose Company has been an important stone in the foundation of the town of Chester. The people of Connecticut thank them for their service, dedication, and contribution to their community.

Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise today in support of Senate Resolution 98. I believe climate change is a serious problem that requires credible action by the international community. Negotiations on an international agreement to limit greenhouse gas emissions will conclude this December in Kyoto, Japan. This is an essential step in the long-term, global efforts to deal with climate change. While I support Senate resolution's call for increased involvement of developing countries in the Kyoto agreement, the resolution does not take into account other key components of the treaty that are essential to its success, particularly for the United States' business community. 
The scientific basis for moving forward with an international agreement to limit greenhouse gas emissions is compelling and significant. According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change--a group of 2,500 expert scientists representing more than 50 countries, the ever-increasing emissions of greenhouse gases from human activities are changing the global climate. Given the potential impacts of climate change predicted by the IPCC--more droughts, more floods, sea level rise, water scarcity, and increased incidence of infectious diseases--it is not surprising that nations of the world agreed to find more effective ways to understand and deal with the problem. If we don't agree to long-term greenhouse gas limits soon, and instead wait to see how our climate changes, it may be too late. Greenhouse gases remain in the atmosphere for decades to centuries, and there is a long lag time between when gases are emitted and when the climate consequences of those emissions appear. So we need to begin reductions soon to have any long-term effect. And, a new generation of energy-efficient technologies requires a long lead time for development and implementation. This won't happen without clear signals to the market that an international agreement on climate change would provide. 
Senate Resolution 98 focuses on the role of developing countries in the Kyoto agreement. The principles expressed in the resolution regarding developing countries are on target. Climate change cannot be solved by the developed countries alone--we are indeed all in the same boat. 
New commitments by developing countries regarding their performance under the Framework Convention on Climate Change, of course, need to be consistent with their historic responsibility for the problem, as well as their current capabilities. The ground rules for the negotiations--the Berlin mandate--recognize these common, but differentiated responsibilities. 
It is clear that the Berlin mandate can be carried out in a way that is consistent with Senate Resolution 98. The resolution says that developing countries can start with a commitment that is lower relative to the industrialized countries at first. Over time, however, the commitments of developing and developed countries must become comparable to ensure that every country does its fair share to address the problem. 
Senate Resolution 98 states that developing countries have to start making quantified emissions reductions objectives within the same compliance period as developed countries. This means that at a stage to be negotiated over the compliance period of the Kyoto agreement, developing countries must begin to make quantified emissions reductions objectives. Senate Resolution 98 says that it is entirely appropriate for industrialized countries to start making quantified emissions reductions first, as long as developing countries also commit to making quantified emissions reductions before the end of the time period worked out for the Kyoto agreement. I agree with this basic approach--the sooner developing countries take on quantified emissions reductions targets, the sooner we can achieve a global solution to the climate problem. 
At the same time, I am concerned that the resolution does not take into account other key components of the treaty that are essential to protect U.S. competitiveness. I am concerned that elevating one issue to a level of importance that will overshadow other key matters may harm the United States' efforts to ensure that the climate agreement is realistic, achievable, and will not harm the U.S. economy. For example, the need for flexibility in implementing a treaty is critical to protect U.S. competitiveness. Some countries, such as members of the European Union, would prefer highly prescriptive policies and measures to meet reduction targets. The United States' negotiating team has made flexibility an absolute prerequisite for any agreement, and I want to commend them for this approach. I believe that, to be acceptable, our businesses must have the most flexibility possible to find the least-cost ways to reduce emissions. This means the agreement must contain provisions that are so important to our business community: emissions trading, joint implementation between nations, and appropriate credits for those countries that have already made certain emissions reductions. Senate Resolution 98 is silent regarding these provisions. 
As we grapple with the human judgments and values that inevitably will determine how we handle climate change, we must base our actions on the facts--the scientific evidence of climate change, the physical effects that are likely to result from it, and the ways we can credibly address this problem on a global basis. While Senate Resolution 98 is only part of a bigger picture that needs to be addressed, it is a step toward adressing this global issue.

Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise to speak on the Department of Commerce's Advanced Technology Program or ATP. This is an important program and I have long appreciated Senator Hollings' work in founding and continuing it. The amendment offered by Senator Brownback would prohibit ATP awards to companies with revenues that exceed $2.5 billion. I oppose Senator Brownback's amendment and would like to thank Senator Frist for his floor statement explaining why he too has voted against the amendment. Like Senator Frist, I think there are several solid reasons as to why Senator Brownback's amendment should be opposed. 
My first concern is process--this is an attempt to legislate a very complex issue now being considered by the authorizing committee, on an appropriations bill. The Senate Commerce Committee, Science and Technology Subcommittee under Senator Frist, the Subcommittee Chair, and Senator Rockefeller, ranking Democrat, are planning legislation on ATP, including a careful look at this issue, later this session. I believe in this case that the Senate should vote to wait and see what action the authorizing committee takes. 
I would also highlight recent changes to the ATP proposed by Commerce Secretary William Daley that may assist in resolving this debate. The Secretary's action plan for changes is very responsive to recommendations I and other Members of Congress made. Specifically the evaluation criteria will be changed to put more emphasis on joint ventures or consortia. This will help ensure that the program funds only pre-competitive research and development; for if competitors in the development phase cooperate in research and development, they are very unlikely to allow access to each other's product development efforts. 
Secretary Daley has mandated that the cost-share ratio for large companies, applying as single applicants, will be increased to a minimum of 60 percent. Proposals will also be reviewed by venture capital experts to ensure that private sector financing would not be available and a government role is needed. When combined with changes in the evaluation criteria favoring small and medium sized businesses, these changes will result in virtually all ATP grants being awarded to either consortium or small and medium sized company single applicants. 
Finally, modifications to the ATP's rules and procedures would help facilitate cooperative ventures between industry and universities and national laboratories. To date, university and Federal laboratory participation has been hindered over concerns regarding intellectual property and project management. 
After studying the Secretary's report, I believe that the ATP will emerge both as a more effective program and one with a significantly reduced political profile. Its new structure appears to have answered criticisms raised and is consistent with the bipartisan ideas endorsed by the Senate Science and Technology Caucus of which I am a member. 
I believe that the changes introduced by Secretary Daley, now under review by the Commerce Committee, are a better way to ensure the continued effectiveness of the Advanced Technology Program than the pending amendment which would completely ban large companies from all participation in the ATP. Large companies play a key role in the innovation process through their organizational ability, resources and market experience. To entirely preclude their participation in the ATP would be a mistake. I will vote to oppose this amendment and look forward to Senator Frist's subcommittee review. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Chair. I was concerned that my friend and colleague from Pennsylvania, the chairman of the subcommittee, thought I was missing in action on a controversial matter. I apologize. I was involved in a Government Affairs campaign finance investigation. 
I stand solidly and strongly with the chairman of our subcommittee. It is my privilege to be his ranking Democratic member in fashioning the proposal on compensation of executive salary which is in the DOD Authorization Act before us. We compromised and, as I believe I just heard the Senator from Pennsylvania say, we specifically rejected a proposal from the administration that would have permitted reimbursement of salaries as high as $4 million a year for some senior executives in the largest corporations. 
To tell you the truth, they had a plausible argument in terms of getting the best people to do the job for our defense needs, but it was, we thought, an untenable argument so we came up with this modest increase in the cap. The cap is rationally based. In fact, in some ways it is tighter than any of the limitations in law today for the simple reason that, unlike those limitations, our provision would apply to all costs charged on all defense and nondefense contracts regardless of when the contracts may have been entered. 
The flexibility provided by our approach, which is to say to base the limitation on a median private sector salary, is likely to be particularly important to small companies that rely on Department of Defense business. Unlike the larger and diversified companies that can eat the larger executive salaries, many smaller businesses, particularly the high-technology businesses that are the source of so much growth around our country, are not in a position to pay their executives what the market requires and absorb or, to use the phrase I used before, `eat' any unreimbursed amounts. If the cap that we set is too low, some of these businesses are going to have difficulty attracting and retaining qualified personnel. 
Mr. President, the proposed amendment, which would lower the cap to $200,000, is, in my opinion, not necessary to protect the taxpayers from excessive executive salaries. If a contractor pays an executive, for instance, the $4 million a year that might have been allowed under the Pentagon proposal, the provision in the underlying bill would disallow $3,660,000 of that salary. The proposed amendment would save an additional $140,000. That is a difference of less than 4 percent, and the cost of it in terms of lost opportunity is much larger. 
What we will lose by going after that additional amount is far more significant than the amount of money that will be gained. We are going to lose the flexibility for small businesses that are dependent on Government contracts to pay what the market requires to attract the skilled professionals that they need to provide the quality products and services that we need to maintain our national security. We risk driving such experts out of companies that work for the Government and reducing the expertise available to our Government, the Pentagon and other Federal agencies, and, most important I believe, we risk driving some small businesses that are highly reliant on such experts out of doing business with the Government at all. 
Mr. President, the amendment before us, of course, is an easy amendment to vote for. We can say we took a whack at high salaries of executives of companies. What I am suggesting is the difference between the amendment and the underlying bill is minimal and the consequences for a lot of people, for a lot of companies, for a lot of areas of our country where those companies exist, for our Government itself in obtaining the 
highest quality, most cost-efficient products is much, much greater. 
So it is not an easy vote. But, of course, that is not why the Senate is here. This is the right vote. I urge my colleagues to reject this amendment and stand by the very reasonable proposal in the underlying bill. 
I thank the Chair and I yield the floor.

Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleague, Senator Mack, in introducing the Hong Kong Press Freedom Act. 
In a very few days, Hong Kong will revert to Chinese sovereignty. Already, there is evidence that China will not fully honor its commitment to preserve Hong Kong's democratic institutions and way of life under the rubric, one country, two systems. Beijing has announced it will eliminate Hong Kong's democratically elected legislative council and that it will reimpose several restrictive civil order statutes, including against certain types of political expression. Even more disturbing, there are indications that media self-censorship is replacing freedom of the press. 
It is fitting and proper that we introduce this legislation now. Eight years ago, Chinese authorities, most of whom remain in power today, brutally massacred students and others who wanted assurances that their government would become more accountable to the will of the people. They were seeking democratic progress, not revolutionary license. Beijing answered them with tanks, and 8 years later, Tiananmen Square remains a vivid reminder of what autocrats can and will do even in full view of astonished world opinion. 
This bill would not have prevented the evil of Tiananmen Square; and it is not intended as a warning to China. It is simply principle put into action. As Americans, we understand how important a free press is to preserving the rule of law and to protecting the rights and dignity of individuals against the power of the state. Our action here will help assure that reporters in hong Kong will not be cowed by the memory of Tiananmen Square. This bill supports those who choose to put themselves at risk by reporting honestly and openly what they see and hear when the Chinese flag replaces the Union Jack. We owe them our gratitude and protection, and this bill will help us provide it. 
Specifically, this measure offers special immigration status to journalists and their families if they are threatened with reprisal because of their work. A similar measure was introduced in the House by Representative Porter and 27 other Members in February. I urge my Senate colleagues to join this effort and to pass the Hong Kong press freedom bill.

 Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to commemorate the 150th anniversary of New Haven Light, also known as the Five Mile Point Lighthouse in New Haven, CT. One of New England's most recognizable landmarks, New Haven Light has weathered countless storms yet still stands its silent watch over the waters of Long Island Sound and one of the region's busiest ports. 
This year's annual SNET New Haven Harborfest is made all the more special by the anniversary of this beloved landmark and local treasure. I commend those who have worked so hard to preserve New Haven Light and maintain the vitality of New Haven's harbor and Long Wharf district. 
This Nation's proud history is forever linked with the important waterways of New England. From the battles in the War for Independence to the economic prosperity of the late 20th century, ports like New Haven Harbor have always played a critical role in the development of the United States. I am proud to stand today and recognize the importance of New Haven Harbor as well as celebrate the milestone anniversary of New Haven Light.

Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, the reconciliation bill contains provisions that impact most of the programs and services provided by the Federal Government. Few people in the United States are not touched in some way by the changes we have voted for during this debate. I would like to touch upon just a few of the provisions. 
The bill includes significant progress toward protecting the Medicare Program. Without the changes included in this legislation, the Medicare trust fund would go bankrupt in 2001. The changes include the first major structural changes to Medicare in its 30-year history. The Senate bill modernizes Medicare by offering seniors the option of choosing from among a range of quality private health plans in addition to existing fee-for-service Medicare. It includes important new health insurance coverage for the Nation's children. It returns a degree of protection for people who live and work in our country, but because of foreign birth are not citizens of the United States. 
The bill makes substantial advances in ensuring that Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries can get comparative information to help them choose the best available health care plan for their needs. An amendment I sponsored with Senators Chafee, Jeffords, Kerrey, Breaux, Wyden, and Kennedy requires that includes comparative information on benefits, cost sharing, premiums, service area, quality and performance including disenrollment, satisfaction, health process and outcomes, grievance procedures, supplemental benefits, and physician reimbursement method be provided to Medicaid recipients in managed care. In many cases, Medicaid managed care plans have significant differences in the treatment of asthma, immunization, heart disease, diabetes, and other problems endemic to the Medicaid population. This amendment should assist Medicaid beneficiaries in choosing high-quality plans, and through competition among plans, increase the quality of all. 
The bill also included an important demonstration program for Medicare based on the Government's own employee health care plan. That demonstration program includes provisions to improve the quality of health care for Americans based on a bill I sponsored, S. 795, the Federal Health Care Quality, Consumer Information and Protection Act. 
The dramatic drive of millions of people into managed care was all geared toward stopping unacceptable cost increases in healthcare. Now cost increases have slowed and it is time to focus on quality. Congress has made some initial, spasmodic efforts, such as last year's drive-through delivery legislation. The health care quality provisions in this demonstration program represents an effort to take a more comprehensive and durable approach to improving health care quality. 
The Government has a powerful tool we think has gone unused--its purchasing power. The Federal Government is the single biggest purchaser of health care in the country. If we use that purchasing power wisely, the quality of health care in the country will be pulled upward dramatically. If we don't, the Federal Government will drag down the efforts the private sector is making to improve their 
employee's quality of health care. 
If the bill passes, the Government will only purchase Medicare coverage in this demonstration program that satisfies two requirements: 
First, plans will have to provide information that allows people to make straightforward plan-to-plan comparisons of health care quality. With that information, Medicare beneficiaries could look up the plans in their area to see which had the best record of care for the elderly. Empowering consumers with comparative quality information would force health care plans to compete continuously and aggressively on quality resulting in ongoing health care improvements. 
Second, all health care plans in the demonstration would have to meet certain minimum criteria or they couldn't be purchased by the Federal Government. Setting uniform federal criteria provides a powerful tool to address quality issues that emerge from the rapidly evolving health care industry. Existing accrediting agencies like the National Committee on Quality Assurance for Quality Assurance [NCQA] or the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations [JCAHO] could be licensed to certify that the health care plans are in compliance with the minimum criteria which should minimize bureaucratic duplication. 
Finally, to hold this proposed system together and prevent the standards from becoming outdated, an Office of Competition is created within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. The Director of the Office of Competition will set and update the basic requirements for comparative data and minimum criteria. They will also work out a formula to pay for value. High quality plans will get paid slightly more than low quality plans. 
The Director will draw on the expertise already developed by large private purchasers and coordinate with them in improving the purchasing requirements over time. 
The stakes are high. This year over $1 trillion, almost one-seventh of the economy, will go toward health care services. Purchasers, both private and public, need to demand quality from the health care marketplace. Today you can identify a good stereo, a good car, or a good shampoo. But, you can't get the most basic information about the quality of your healthcare. That lack of information on health care quality is no longer acceptable, it can be fixed, and the Government should join the best corporate purchasers in the repair effort. 
I am deeply concerned about one aspect of the Medicare package that is included in this budget reconciliation bill. The Senate Finance Committee has enacted a series of reforms that would dramatically change the methodology by which payments are made to Medicare managed care plans as well as the new plans envisioned in the bill. This new payment structure would result in a redistribution of Medicare resources that is very beneficial to areas that have low health care costs and very damaging to areas where the delivery of health care services is much more costly. 
In my home State of Connecticut, seniors in four of our eight counties would suffer from Medicare managed care payments that, under this bill, would decline by more than 20 percent relative to current law. Don't misunderstand--I support actions to keep the Medicare trust fund solvent. But 
these reformulations don't just produce savings--they fundamentally shift expenditures from high cost to low cost areas. In one Connecticut county, this legislation would extract 57 times more savings from seniors enrolled in managed care than would the House Ways and Means Committee bill, which achieves similar savings. These are sobering figures--and they do not even take into account the impact of the bill's risk adjustment mechanism, which would automatically reduce Medicare payments by an additional 5 percent for all new managed care enrollees in their first year of enrollment. 
This legislation over-reaches in seeking to achieve a greater measure of geographic equity in the Medicare payment system. Instead of making the modest adjustments that are needed to improve the fairness of the current system, this bill calls for sweeping reforms that would disrupt the coverage of many seniors in order to help others. 
Tragically, many of those who would be hurt the most are low-income seniors who already have selected Medicare managed care plans because they need the additional benefits--such as prescription drug coverage, and dental and vision care--and the low out-of-pocket costs that many of these plans offer. These low-income seniors cannot afford to expose themselves to the high deductibles and copayments of the Medicare fee-for-service system, nor can they afford to purchase an expensive supplemental Medigap policy. 
As I consider this issue, I think about the many areas in Connecticut that have suffered from economic downturns in recent years and, even today, are not enjoying the strong economic growth that is evident throughout much of the country. Seniors in these areas are particularly vulnerable. Considering that a disproportionate number of Medicare managed care enrollees are low-income seniors, I believe we should proceed carefully as we contemplate reforms that affect their coverage. For many of these seniors, a reduction in their Medicare benefits would cause severe financial hardship. 
I want to emphasize that I have no desire to be involved in any contest that pits the Medicare beneficiaries of Connecticut against those of Iowa, Nebraska or any other State. I completely support the expansion of new health care choices to all seniors, regardless of where they live. I am convinced, however, that this can be accomplished without awarding 60-percent payment increases for certain low-cost areas--many of which tend to be sparsely populated--at the expense of other areas where large numbers of seniors are already enrolled in private health plan options. The number of seniors who would be penalized by this shortsighted approach far exceeds the number who would benefit. 
I strongly believe that a more cautious, thoughtful approach is warranted. For example, a 70/30 blend between local and national payment rates would go a long ways toward eliminating the disparities that currently exist--without causing massive cuts in certain areas. In addition, a minimum annual update for all plans, combined with some kind of link between growth in fee-for-service spending and managed care spending, would help to assure that the resources available to Medicare managed care plans do not fall hopelessly behind the growth in medical inflation. It is totally unrealistic to think that we can allow payments to decrease in certain areas--while actual costs are increasing by 5 or 6 percent annually--without having any adverse affect 
on seniors. 
As we move forward with Medicare reform, we need to acknowledge that it is, in fact, more costly to serve Medicare beneficiaries in some areas of the country than others. There are legitimate reasons why it costs more to deliver health care services in densely populated urban areas. The wages of medical personnel and the capital costs of medical facilities differ considerably from region to region and from State to State. Even within individual States, medical costs vary from county to county. To discount this economic reality, as this legislation does, is sheer folly. 
Perhaps the most troublesome component of this Medicare payment proposal is the new enrollee risk adjustment mechanism. This provision arbitrarily and automatically reduces Medicare payments by 5 percent for all new managed care enrollees--regardless of their age or health status--in their first year of enrollment. I have serious concerns about the implications of this proposal. How are we supposed to promote competition within the Medicare Program if we begin by saying that everyone who leaves the fee-for-service system will be subject to a 5 percent penalty? This new enrollee tax will limit beneficiary choice by discouraging health plans from entering markets in which seniors do not have private health plan options at this time. Everyone in this chamber should be deeply alarmed by this misguided provision. 
Having given this Medicare payment proposal an honest and thoughtful evaluation, I am convinced that we should work toward a more sensible and well-reasoned approach when this legislation is considered in the Senate-House conference committee. I want to state very clearly that I do not have a problem with the amount of Medicare savings this legislation would achieve; I just believe we have an obligation to achieve these savings in ways that do not disrupt the coverage of seniors. I urge my colleagues to join me in calling for a new approach.

Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, yesterday we passed the State Department Authorization Act by a vote of 90 to 5. Today there is comment on the bill that we passed yesterday in the Washington Post regarding particularly the sections of that legislation that deal with the city of Jerusalem and the recognition of Jerusalem as the undivided capital of Israel. 
In this article, the State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns is quoted as saying:  
Our view is that Jerusalem is the most emotional and complex issue that Israel and the Palestinians will have to deal with in the permanent status negotiations. We do not believe it is wise for the United States or any other outside country to make an initiative on Jerusalem that in effect prejudges that issue. 
Then later on in the article, the writer of the article says: 
The State Department regards Jerusalem as `disputed territory' with its permanent status to be settled in negotiations and has kept the U.S. embassy in Tel Aviv. 
Mr. President, I want to respond very briefly to that and say that the suggestions made by the State Department spokesman in my opinion are wrong. The commentary by the reporter does not recognize the fact that in the Jerusalem Embassy Act of 1995--both Houses of Congress passed and it became law--is a provision that not only directed that our Embassy be placed in Jerusalem instead of Tel Aviv thereby doing what we have done in every other country but one in the world, which is to have our Embassy in the city in which the host country had designated as its capital. But, Mr. President, in that bill--that bill now law--this Congress made very clear its intention that it is American policy to recognize Jerusalem as the undivided capital of Israel. We, in fact by strong bipartisan majority, adopted a resolution a short time ago on the 30th anniversary of the reunification of Jerusalem restating that position. 
So, Mr. President, this may be controversial. But trust is built up among parties, including those who are involved in the Middle East process, including Israel, the Palestinians, and other countries. Trust is built on honesty. And honest reflection of not just American policy but American law as adopted by this Congress in 1995 is that Jerusalem is the undivided capital of Israel. 
It is time, therefore I would say, to bring our policies in line with our law; that time for the statements such as those made by the State Department spokesman in my opinion respectfully has passed. 
I appreciate very much again the graciousness of my friend from Texas for allowing me to say this. 
I thank the Chair. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise this afternoon to congratulate Senator Helms, Senator Biden and the members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee for the bipartisan spirit reflected in the Foreign Affairs Reform bill, and particularly for their efforts to restructure the foreign affairs agencies for the 21st century. 
When a proposal to consolidate agencies came to the floor last year, I offered an amendment that would have struck provisions integrating the United States Information Agency into the Department of State. At that time, there appeared to be a serious risk that the valuable mission of USIA, public diplomacy, would be harmed in a consolidation process overly inspired by a zeal to slash budgets and bureaucracies. I will continue to watch this closely. 
Those of us who shared this concern are pleased that the effort being made now will strengthen and not diminish public diplomacy by keeping the focus on the team responsible for its conduct. Despite the wonderful capabilities of technology, we cannot count on it alone to carry America's message to foreign countries. There will always be the problem that Edward R. Murrow described as taking the message `the last three feet.' 
What I imagine Murrow meant was that foreign publics will be open to understanding America's case only when they know us and respect us, and when we know enough about them to relate to their interests and values. This means more than shouting at them through technology's loudspeakers. It means `being there,' having foreign service professionals in the field whose work it is to cultivate relationships that go beyond government-to-government communiques. 
American interests and values will be served through effective use of the international media, the internet, and government broadcasting capabilities such as the Voice of America. But we must not allow these tools of mass communications to become separated from the professionals on the ground who follow the pulse of the people, whether in the market or at the University. American foreign policy needs engagement, up close and personal, now more than ever. 
And so I am heartened by the efforts this legislation makes to advance public diplomacy and I encourage my colleagues here in Congress, and the Administration, to remain focused on the importance of the mission at hand rather than on the potential for modest savings later on. 
In that same vein, Mr. President, I also would like to thank Senator Lugar for introducing in this legislation a foreign affairs review process as a necessary corollary to agency reorganization. Senator Lugar and I worked together to craft this approach because we believe it is time to examine systematically what our diplomacy must do for us in the 21st century. The review, which has been endorsed by a large, distinguished, and diverse group of foreign affairs experts and others with a great deal of public and private international experience, will look at the functions of all the federal departments and agencies with interests and assets overseas. 
Some describe the way we do America's business abroad as `a 40 agency conundrum.' Dozens of agencies, in addition to State, USIA, AID and the other `traditional' members of the foreign affairs community, pursue separate overseas agendas with little coordination or cooperation between them. It is an inefficient and, as the world continues to change from the stark East-West split of the Cold War, an ineffective way to advance our interests and values around the globe. 
The end of the Cold War has brought new challenges and opportunities to our international relations. We have seen how these can erupt into conflicts that disrupt economic life, produce waves of desperate refugees, threaten public health and the environment, and sometimes provoke horrible violence. We cannot respond to these new circumstances by relying on old methods. 
Streamlining bureaucracies is an important step in the right direction. But we need to do more. It will not serve our interests to do the wrong things more efficiently. We need to look inside the organizations themselves to see what they do and how they do it. We need to evaluate both the necessity and the manner of their work. Our representatives overseas often are locked in mind-numbing endeavors with no discernible value apart from feeding an insatiable Cold War dinosaur. Jurassic Park was a terrific movie; but it's a lousy model for foreign policy. 
This legislation addresses that problem. It creates an outside commission to examine the way America conducts its international relations and it reinforces that effort with parallel study by the Secretary of State. Ultimately, the Secretary, the official with responsibility for the conduct of our foreign relations, will reconcile the reviews and make proposals to the Congress for any needed changes. Our goal here is not just to improve the way we organize foreign policy. It is to improve the way we conduct foreign policy. 
Mr. President, the key to continued American leadership in the 21st century will be our ability to create more options. Not just to identify the trends and possibilities that circumstances present to us, but to create the opportunities for action that reflect our values and advance our interests. We are the world's indispensable country because we are the only nation with the resonating ideals, the geographical size and location, the economic and military strength, and the political and social diversity to make our presence felt and to exert our influence in every corner of the globe. No other nation can provide that leadership to the world's democratic nations, the leadership to shape a world in which our people can pursue their destiny less encumbered by the unnecessary divisions among the world's people. We in Congress have the privilege and responsibility of safeguarding and enhancing America's moral and material leadership around the world. We do that, in part, by supporting and renewing the agencies and people charged with representing us overseas. We do that by focusing on their mission, and giving them the resources to carry it out. 
This bill is a an important step forward. It recognizes that we need more money for aggressive, smart diplomacy--that we cannot continue to conduct it on a frayed shoestring. It recognizes that our world has changed, and is continuing to change, by directing that we begin to conduct our diplomacy more effectively and to begin to think seriously about what our foreign affairs agencies must be able to do so that the 21st century will not be, in the words of one diplomat, a repeat of the 20th century. And by resolving a serious, lingering conflict over the UN, it recognizes that we are an inseperable part of the family of nations, and that we must work to make the only global organization for this family better--not withdraw from it.

Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate a class of students from Trumbull High School in Trumbull, CT, who won an award at the `We the People * * * The Citizen and the Constitution' national finals held in Washington, DC. These students, under the direction of their teacher, Rita Altieri, were recognized for their expertise on unit 6, `Role of Citizen' of the `We the People * * *' curriculum. This award is given to the school achieving the highest cumulative score during the first 2 days of the national finals in each of the six units. 
I hope my colleagues will join with me in recognizing these outstanding young Americans who competed against 50 other classes from all across the Nation. They have clearly demonstrated a remarkable understanding of the fundamental ideals and values of American constitutional government.

 Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, today I would like to salute 13 outstanding young women who have been honored with the Girl Scout Gold Award by Connecticut Trails Girl Scout Council in North Haven, CT. They are Katherine Berinato, Amy Suzanne Brink, Anne T. Dwyer, Sarah Erling, Carolyn Greeno, Paige Henninger, Bri Lyn Howell, Theresa Lacombe, Kristen A. McAree, Elizabeth Shepherd, Jennifer R. Westmoreland, Rebecca Wonneberger, and Heather Swanson. They are being honored on June 8, 1997, for earning the achievement award in U.S. Girl Scouting. The Girl Scout Gold Award symbolizes outstanding accomplishments in areas of leadership, community service, career planning, and personal development. The award can be earned by girls aged 14-17, or in grades 9-12. 
Girls Scouts of the U.S.A., an organization serving over 2.5 million girls, has awarded more than 20,000 Girl Scout Gold Awards to Senior Girl Scouts since the inception of the program in 1980. To receive the award a Girl Scout must earn four interest project patches, the Career Exploration Pin, the Senior Girl Scout Leadership Award, and the Senior Girl Scout Challenge, as well as design and implement a Girl Scout Gold Award project. A plan for fulfilling these requirements is created by the Senior Girl Scout and is carried out through close cooperation between the girl and an adult Girl Scout volunteer. 
As members of the Connecticut Trails Girl Scout Council, we believe they should receive the public recognition due them for their significant service to their community and their country.

Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to add my voice to those celebrating the 30th anniversary of the reunification of Jerusalem. The Senate has before it a resolution commemorating this occasion. Its passage will be an appropriate and fitting testimony to the courage of those who reunited and reopened the city, and to the wisdom of those who have maintained it that way for the last three decades. 
Jerusalem is a city of faith. It is the spiritual home of Jews, Christians, and Muslims, and it is the sacred symbol and temporal meeting place of their shared legacy and common humanity. Undivided access to its holy sites is a promise made in the tumult of war and kept in the name of peace. Those who made it and those who keep it are rightly remembered by us today. 
Jerusalem also is a national city. It is the undivided capital of Israel--the political and cultural center of one of America's staunchest, most important allies. The continued unity of Jerusalem under Israel's flag is not an issue for debate. It is our best assurance that America's most cherished values, including the rule of law and basic human freedoms, will be preserved and protected in a region critical to our own national interest. 
Thirty years ago, the people of Israel reunified Jerusalem. But for more than 3,000 years, Jerusalem has endured as the city on the hill. Geography and politics alone do not being to explain its significance. It is a place where God touches us and unifies our histories; it is where the privilege and responsibility of Abraham's heritage becomes our own. Peace with justice in Jerusalem is a measure of our integrity as people of faith; and the best hope for peace with justice in Jerusalem is continued undivided sovereignty. 
I urge my colleagues to pass this resolution congratulating the residents of Jerusalem and the people of Israel on the 30th anniversary of that city's reunification.

Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I am delighted to join with Senators Jeffords, Kennedy, and over 30 of our colleagues as an original cosponsor of this important legislation, the Employment Non-Discrimination Act of 1997. By guaranteeing that American workers cannot lose their jobs simply because of their actual or perceived sexual orientation, this bill would extend the bedrock American values of fairness and equality to a group of our citizens who too often have been denied the benefit of those most basic values. 
Our Nation's foundational document, the Declaration of Independence, expressed a vision of our country as one premised upon the essential equality of all people and upon the recognition that our Creator endowed all of us with the inalienable rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. Two hundred and twenty years ago, when that document was drafted, our laws fell far short of implementing the declaration's ideal. But since that time, we have come ever closer, extending by law to more and more of our citizens--to African-Americans, to women, to disabled Americans, to religious minorities, and to others--a legally enforceable guarantee that, with respect to their ability to earn a living at least, they will be treated on their merits and not on characteristics unrelated to their ability to do their jobs. 
It is time to extend that guarantee to gay men and lesbians, who too often have been subject to incidents of discrimination and denied the most basic of rights: the right to obtain and maintain a job. A collection of nearly two dozen studies shows that as many as 46 percent of gay and lesbian workers have experienced significant discrimination in the workplace. The fear in which these workers live was clear from a survey of 1,400 gay men and lesbians in Philadelphia. Seventy-six percent of the men and 81 percent of the women told those conducting the survey that they hide their orientation at work out of concern for their job security. This result, although unfortunate, is not surprising in light of a University of Maryland study that found gay men's income to be 11 to 27 percent lower than that of heterosexual men, thanks to the effects of discrimination. 
The toll this discrimination takes extends far beyond its effect on those individuals who must live in fear and without full employment opportunities. It also takes an unacceptable toll on America's definition of itself as a land of equality and opportunity, as a place where we judge each other on our merits, and as a country that teaches its children that anyone can succeed here as long as they are willing to do their job and work hard. 
This bill provides for equality and fairness--that and no more. It says only what we already have said for women, for people of color, and for others: that you are entitled to have your ability to earn a living depend only on your ability to do the job and nothing else. In fact, the bill would even do somewhat less than it does for women and people of color, because it would not give gay men and women all of the protections we currently provide to other groups protected under our civil rights laws. 
Mr. President, this bill would bring our Nation one large step closer to realizing the vision that Thomas Jefferson so eloquently expressed 220 years ago when he wrote that all of us have a right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this important legislation.

Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleagues Senators Coats and Brownback in introducing the District of Columbia Student Opportunity Scholarship Act of 1997, also known as the DCSOS Act. 
This legislation is quite similar to the provision that passed the House last year as part of the D.C. appropriations bill but failed to make it through conference. It would create a modest tuition scholarship fund that would enable 2,000 low-income students in the District to attend the public, private, or parochial school of their choice. It would also provide direct aid to an additional 2,000 public school students who want to improve their academic skills through after-school tutoring. 
But the circumstances surrounding this proposal have changed dramatically since it was considered last year, and I think it's important to make our colleagues aware of what's happened over the course of the last several months as they consider the bill we're introducing today. 
Most immediately, the deeply troubled D.C. school system has now hit rock-bottom. Last fall, the District Control Board officially declared the schools in crisis, stripped the elected school board of its authority, and authorized an emergency board of trustees to take over the city's public schools. 
In taking these drastic steps, the Control Board issued a report documenting the utter dysfunction of this school system--test scores ranking among the worst in the Nation, students and teachers subjected to violence at twice the national average, gross mismanagement of budget and personnel, buildings literally falling apart, and a tragic misplacement of priorities that puts job preservation ahead of the job of educating the city's children. 
But perhaps the most damning indictment of the D.C. schools came in a single sentence included in the report: the longer students stay in the District's public school system, the Control Board concluded, the less likely they are to succeed educationally. I would urge my colleagues to think about the import of that statement. Instead of helping these children learn more with each passing year, the D.C. schools in many cases have actually become hazardous to the academic health of its students. 
This conclusion should not be all that surprising when you take a closer look at the environment in which these kids are trying to learn. For instance, in April we saw a shocking breakdown of discipline at the Winston Education Center. Several fourth-graders slipped unnoticed into a sideroom right outside an ongoing class and engaged in oral sex, with two of the children's parents claiming their children were sexually assaulted. When the principal learned of the incident, his first reaction was to judge the sexual activity consensual. And earlier this month, Washington Post columnist Colbert King reported that a fifth-grade class at the Harrison Elementary School had gone without a teacher for the past 4 months. This outrageous situation may well have continued had King not exposed it and put pressure on the administration to correct it. 
To force children to attend these schools, where the breakdown is so complete a class can go four months without a teacher, is simply unconscionable. But that is exactly what is happening in the District of Columbia, where thousands of students are trapped in decrepit, dangerous, and disenfranchising schools simply because they cannot afford any alternative. 
That is why we believe there is an urgent need to pass the DCSOS Act. That acronym is not an accident, for this program would provide at least 2,000 of the most disadvantaged families in the District with an educational lifeline, a chance to seek out a school that they believe will offer their child a brighter future. It would give these families the same option that thousands of other families have already exercised by pulling their children from the D.C. public schools or moving out of town altogether. 
Some defenders of the status quo have tried for some time to get us to believe that the residents of this city don't want that kind of choice. But a poll that was released this week 
should shatter that misguided myth once and for all. This survey found that nearly two-thirds of public school parents would send their kids to private schools if money weren't an issue. The poll also shows that there is a strong base of support for the scholarship program we're proposing right out of the gate, before we've done anything to educate the public about it. And most important, it shows that the families we're trying to help would welcome this assistance, with 62 percent of low-income parents saying that the kind of choice we're offering would improve the quality of education for District children. 
Some of the opponents of this legislation will continue to argue that this program, like other attempts to expand opportunities for poor families, will harm or actually ruin the public schools. To suggest that this modest program could make a school system already in crisis any worse defies common sense. In truth, this is a case of the only thing we have to fear is fear itself--that is, the fear of moving beyond the status quo. Knowing that the D.C. schools have hit rock bottom, we shouldn't be closing off any options, which is exactly what influential columnist William Raspberry wrote last week when he endorsed giving choice a chance in the District. 
We need to get past the red herring argument that we must choose between choice and the public schools. Simply put, supporting this scholarship program is not the same as abandoning the public school system. This is not an either-or equation. And to help prove that to the citizens of the District, we have gone out of the way in this legislation to make sure that the funding for these scholarships does not come at the expense of the city's public schools. This is new money and that point should not be overlooked. 
Mr. President, the truth is that we fervently hope that the Board of Trustees and CEO Gen. Julius Becton can rescue this system and make the fundamental reforms necessary to give these students the education they deserve, and we will do what we can to support their efforts. Senator Brownback and I, as chairman and ranking member of the Senate's D.C. Oversight Subcommittee, made that very pledge to General Becton at a hearing we held in April. 
But this mission is at a minimum going to take several years, which begs the question, what happens to those many students who have no choice but to attend schools that most parents who could afford it have long since abandoned? 
We believe that we have a moral obligation to offer those children a way out. That is why many of us view this question not just as a matter of education, but a question of fairness. This is all about our values, specifically the value we place on giving every child--no matter their income, where they live or how they live--the opportunity to fulfill their God-given promise. 
No one is claiming that this scholarship program is a magic bullet. But we strongly believe it will give at least 2,000 disadvantaged students a shot at a better life. We also believe that by providing some competition to the public schools, this program will accelerate the pace of reform within the D.C. school system. Across the country, the growing numbers of charter schools and private scholarship programs are forcing public school systems to confront their failures and building pressure on them to take radical actions to improve the quality of their educational programs. This is starting to happen already in the District, and we are optimistic that this legislation will intensify that movement here. 
If nothing else, this legislation will create a program that will help us test what impact choice has on improving the educational opportunities of poor families in urban areas, and thereby help us make informed decisions in the future about whether to expand this kind of initiative to other cities. There have been some promising signs coming out of the choice programs in Milwaukee and Cleveland, but the reality is we don't know with much certainty whether expanding choice will produce noticeable results. This legislation could establish a national experiment, and provide us with some real answers to the critical questions we've been wrestling with. It's for that very reason we call for a thorough evaluation of the D.C. scholarship program in our legislation. 
The bottom line, Mr. President, is that it is time to give choice a chance in the District. We cannot in conscience continue to ignore the plight of these children any longer. They deserve an opportunity to break out of the nightmarish cycle of poverty, dependency, and violence and to live the American dream. This bipartisan legislation will begin to restore hope to some of these families, and I would strongly urge my colleagues to support it.

 Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I am entering this statement into the Record because I am unable to return to Washington for the votes on the fiscal year 1998 supplemental appropriation conference report and the fiscal year 1998 budget resolution conference report due to my son's out-of-town college graduation today. Had I been there, I would have voted for the budget resolution and against the supplemental appropriation because of the automatic continuing resolution and other extraneous provisions in the bill.

 Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I would like to take a few moments and draw attention to a remarkable example of a Federal investment in science and technology that is producing a return to the benefit of society. In this case, it was the vision of an individual, combined with technical knowledge derived from space research, which has created an exciting new industry. Back in 1984, the inventor's idea was to design a robot that could be used in hospitals and eventually homes. Today, robots manufactured by HelpMate Robotics, Inc., of Danbury, CT, roam hospital hallways, delivering medications, meals, x-rays and patients' records. Handling these errands allows orderlies and nurses more time to concentrate on patient care. 
Central to the story of the hospital robots is the 72-year-old founder of HelpMate Robotics, Dr. Joseph Engelberger. Dr. Engelberger is widely acknowledged as the father of the industrial robot, an idea he had much more success selling to Japan's auto industry than in America. As a consequence, Japan grew to dominate the world robotic market and this was one of the factors that for many years enabled it to retain a competitive advantage over American automakers. Not content with having helped start one revolution, Engelberger founded HelpMate Robotics with the idea to use hospital robots as a step in the process toward design of machines that would be useful in personal homes. 
I am especially pleased to report that many of the achievements of Dr. Engelberger and HelpMate Robotics were made possible through close cooperation with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. The new technologies necessary in the design of a robot that is capable of avoiding people in busy hospital hallways, summoning elevators, and recognizing familiar territory, were derived from research already underway at NASA. HelpMate has won several NASA SBIR [Small Business Innovative Research] awards, which were established to stimulate conversion of Government-funded R&D into commercial applications. Transfer of knowledge and expertise has also flowed from the company back to NASA. Late last year, the space agency awarded an SBIR grant to HelpMate for development of a prototype robot for terrestrial experiments that anticipate space utilization of robotics. The space robot will begin to pave the way for the next step in Dr. Engelberger's dream--a robot capable of helping the elderly stay at home by performing the myriad number of tasks that become difficult later in life. Also helpful in the commercialization of NASA technology was a unique program developed by the National Technology Transfer Center in Wheeling, WV, and Unisphere Institute in Washington, DC. 
The story of Dr. Engelberger and HelpMate Robotics is an example of the way that a patient Federal investment in science and technology can lead to new products that employ Americans and make for a better quality of life. It is also the story of one man's creative genius and untiring devotion in making a dream become reality. I salute Dr. Engelberger for his accomplishments with HelpMate and upon his receipt of the prestigious Japan Prize.

Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr President, I would like to rise to explain my vote on the Hatch-Kennedy amendment. The budget resolution under consideration is a fragile compromise. Support from the President, Republicans and Democrats was achieved after months of negotiation. 
One of the key provisions in this agreement of great importance to me is the additional $16 billion for health care coverage of children. This funding will be used to cover an additional 5 million children. Connecticut alone is estimated to have 85,000 uninsured children 18 years and younger. The new funding will go a long way to bring health care to those kids. 
The Hatch-Kennedy amendment was a good faith effort to go farther and I agree--we should go farther. Over 10 million American children lack insurance and more each month go uncovered. For these children and their parents health is not just a blessing, it is an economic necessity. 
The amendment sponsors also said much about tobacco today with which I agree. According to the CDC, smoking is the leading cause of preventable death in the United States. Smoking is up among teenagers and this rise ultimately will translate into many premature deaths from smoking-related diseases. I have no hesitancy to support an increase in tobacco taxes. 
But the vote I cast today was not on children's health coverage. It was not on a tobacco tax. The vote I cast today was on whether to make substantial changes in critical elements of an arduously negotiated bipartisan budget agreement. On this issue, the issue of whether to risk the resolution, I disagreed with the sponsors of the amendment. 
I felt that the amendment threatened to undo the careful balancing and months of negotiation represented by the budget compromise. In the end, the effort to increase spending, threatened the children's health care coverage that we had achieved through negotiations. 
I hope that we will return to the issue of children's health coverage, but at this time the wiser course is to move forward in support of the resolution in front of the Senate. Compromise is never perfect, but perfection is rarely possible.

 Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to James R. (Jim) Mellor, who retires next week from his position as chief executive officer and chairman of the board of General Dynamics Corp., a position he has held for 3 years. Jim has been with General Dynamics for a total of 16 years. Prior to becoming CEO and chairman, he was the president and chief operating officer and before that, the executive vice president--Marine, Business Systems and Corporate Planning. Jim Mellor is completing an illustrious 42 year career in the defense industry having worked at Litton Industries and Hughes Aircraft Corp. before joining General Dynamics. 
During his time with General Dynamics Jim took part in the delivery of 18 Trident ballistic missile submarines, the upgrade of the Army's M1 tank to the state-of-the-art M1A2, and the development and transition into production of the Tomahawk cruise missile. The Trident submarine played a major role in bringing about the end of the cold war, and we are all familiar with the important contributions made by the M1 tank and the Tomahawk cruise missile in our overwhelming success in Desert Storm. 
Jim is a graduate of the University of Michigan, earning both bachelor of science and master of science degrees from that institution. He served in the U.S. Army from 1952 to 1955. While at Hughes & Litton he received three patents relating to large screen display and digital computing technology. He has also authored more than 30 articles in national and international publications covering a wide range of management and technical subjects. 
In addition to these accomplishments, Jim has been active in many charitable and community causes. He is a member of the University of Southern California Business School Board of Councilors, a member of the National Advisory Committee of the University of Michigan, and a trustee of Ford's Theater. Under his leadership for the past 7 years, General Dynamics has sponsored the annual Memorial Day Concert held right here on the Capitol Grounds. Jim has also been an active sponsor of and participant in the Juvenile Diabetes Foundation's annual walk on the Mall. Jim and his wife, Suzanne, will be moving to California to be near their three children and nine grandchildren, but will maintain a residence in the Washington area and will remain active in business and governmental issues. 
Please join me in paying tribute to this distinguished engineer, business leader, civic sponsor, and family man.

Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank my friend and colleague and, on matters of defense, my partner, Senator Coats from Indiana. 
Mr. President, I want to add a few words to those spoken by my colleague about the Quadrennial Defense Review, which was released by Secretary of Defense Cohen earlier today. It has been my pleasure to work with the Senator from Indiana, as well as with our colleagues on the Senate Armed Services Committee, Senator McCain, Senator Robb, Senator Kempthorne, Senator Levin, and many others in a bipartisan effort that led to legislation requiring the Quadrennial Defense Review and the National Defense Panel. 
Our intent in sponsoring this legislation, was to drive the defense debate to a strategy-based assessment of our future military requirements and capabilities, not to do a budget-driven incremental massage of the status quo. 
We were motivated by two factors in calling for this over-the-horizon review of our defense needs. First, we did not want this to be just another annual report on what our defense needs are. Second, we wanted to force the Pentagon to look beyond the short range and to understand that many of us inside and outside of Congress believe that the decisions we are making today will affect our ability to protect our national security 10 to 20 years out. 
From my first review of the Quadrennial Defense Review I would say while the report issued today does not live up to the high expectations I had for it, it is a step forward in the process that Senator Coats has just described. If we want to make defense decisions effectively, we have to consider two dramatic changes that have occurred in our world, which are influencing our defense needs. One is the dramatic and ongoing change in the post-cold-war world; second is the extraordinary change in technology, the transition we have made from an industrial age to an information age, which inevitably will affect the way wars are fought. 
Even before it was released, the Quadrennial Defense Review achieved, I think, an important part of our goal by catalyzing a broad and vigorous debate within the Pentagon which engaged more people who considered more options than either of the previous two post-cold-war security assessments done in the Bush administration and then in the first year of the Clinton administration. The reviewing process began, also, to stimulate similar debate outside of the Pentagon and outside of Congress. I believe that all those involved in the Pentagon effort have done well by debating the controversial questions and in making recommendations they believed were essential, even though some of those did not, in my opinion, go far enough and were not bold enough, and even though some of them are recommendations that will be controversial here in Congress. 
I want to particularly draw attention to significant steps forward that are made in the QDR in three critical areas. 
First, I believe the QDR has developed a much more comprehensive view of our strategic future military environment than we had from the two previous studies; that is, the way in which the national security environment, will be affected by unconventional threats to our security, including, of course, terrorism and chemical and biological warfare, but also including the capacity of an enemy to strike at us in what the military calls an asymmetrical way, that is, to find our vulnerability, invest much less than we spend on our military, and then to strike at that vulnerability. 
Second, I think the QDR has taken some significant steps forward in beginning to deal with management improvements within the Pentagon and in confronting the need for some reductions in manpower and some reductions in acquisition of high-visibility procurement programs and in recommending, as Senator Coats has indicated, two additional rounds of BRAC, of the base closure process. 
To put it mildly, that will not be popular on Capitol Hill. And, yet, the more you look at the reductions that have already occurred in the size of our military forces and the extent to which we have reduced tooth but not reduced tail, it is hard to conclude that, in the interest of our national security, we do not need to further reduce military infrastructure. 
Third, although I would criticize the QDR for being more budget driven than strategy driven, the Pentagon has presented some conclusions about reducing forces that they assume can help bring the defense program more closely and realistically in line with the fiscal assumptions that they are operating under. 
Nevertheless, why do I say the report, as I looked at it this afternoon, does not live up to my own hopes for it? I find it to be too much of a status-quo document. While it is true we have reduced personnel and force structure significantly since the close of the cold war, the shape and focus of our military remains substantially what it was then. This report represents, as others have said, essentially a `salami-slicing' approach. It is not a dramatic change, nor does it seem to point to future dramatic changes to deal with increased workload for our military forces to respond to the much more complicated geopolitical situation nor to changes in technology, which have created a revolution in military affairs. 
Mr. President, as I said a moment ago, the report was more budget driven than strategy driven. Perhaps that is understandable for the Pentagon has to live within the constraints we impose, but I must say, Senator Coats and I and the others did not introduce legislation which called for this Quadrennial Defense Review as a way to cut the defense budget. That might be a result, but a future-oriented review might just as logically lead to an increase in the defense budget, depending on what a strategic review of the world determines that our future defense needs will be. In fact, as you look at the more comprehensive strategic review of the future of the military environment that is in this QDR, it argues for additional capacity to that which the report continues to advocate: Which is the capacity to meet two major regional threats, a series of additional requirements, including terrorism, chemical and biological warfare, missile defense, and peacekeeping. Yet, I don't see the connection between what I think is the more accurately described complicated strategic future we have and the programs the report advocates to meet that future. 
The report is not strategy driven. It continues to require that the military be structured to deal with two major regional conflicts but its assessment of the strategic environment raises questions about whether that is an appropriate standard, particularly since one of those conflicts presumably would be on the Korean Peninsula against North Korea, a state that many question will constitute a threat to security very much longer. So, as we look 10 to 20 years out, will our major threat in Asia be on the Korean Peninsula, or will it come from another great power or midsize power that has gained nuclear capability and can disrupt the entire region? 
The report makes no recommendations for change to the organization of the current force and only minor changes to the size of that force. As I have indicated, some weapons-purchasing programs were reduced, but no major programs have been canceled. Perhaps even more important, from my own point of view, as we look forward, no new programs were recommended to deal with the extraordinary range of threats and responsibilities that are described in the strategic review part of the report. The explosion in technology could literally and totally change the way enemies will fight us and what weapons they will employ, while at the same time creating enormous opportunities for us, if we wisely and boldly use technology, to fundamentally improve our military capability to defend our interests perhaps in a much more cost-effective way. 
I also was disappointed that the report did not deal with the further implementation of the Goldwater-Nichols legislation, which 
I think most observers would say has not fully achieved its goals for more jointness. The fact is, too much of what happens in the Pentagon and our military still happens in the stovepipes of the four services. We do not see enough cooperation across service lines--joint training, for instance--to either achieve the dollar savings or the increases in fighting effectiveness that many observers think will come from increased jointness. 
Mr. President, a final word. There is a brief reference to space and the role space may play in future warfare. Remember, we are talking about 10 to 20 years from now. It is hard to imagine as we see the world depend more and more on space-based satellites that our future enemies will not rely on a wide range of space-based capabilities to fight us. It seems to me this suggests a very, very urgent need for us to consider the implications of that for our future military preparedness, including very controversial questions, which I think we have to consider in the responsible exercise of our duties, whether we should proceed with what might be called the weaponization of space, and what we should do to develop capacity to defend against attacks on us from space. 
In summary, I feel strongly that we need to act more boldly and broadly now. We need to stop doing business as usual now so we can better respond to the challenges of the future, and that goes not just for those in the Pentagon, but also for those of us in Congress, because the decisions that we are making today will commit enormous national resources and determine the military forces we will have for decades. 
The fact is that the extraordinary victory we achieved in the gulf war was the result not only of the extraordinary military leadership we had and the extraordinary bravery and skill of our troops on the ground, in the air, on the water, but it also was the result of decisions and investments made in the seventies in military technology that came online and were available to be used in the early 1990's in the gulf war. 
We have to think, as we make the decisions we do committing hundreds of billions of dollars to defense programs, whether these are the programs we will need 10 and 20 years from now. The fact is, if we choose unwisely and a future opponent chooses more wisely, we may well be jeopardizing not only the lives of our soldiers, but also the lives of our children and our grandchildren. When we discover that, we will have precious little time and perhaps not the resources to fix our mistakes. 
So in those ways, I find the QDR to be lacking, but Senator Coats and our cosponsors anticipated this and believed it would be the first step in a dynamic process. I hope that is the way in which the QDR, will be seen--as a first step, an important one--in a series of steps to determine what our future military needs will be. It does, in fact, provide a sound base from which this critical discussion can proceed. 
I think Secretary Cohen himself has recognized this is only the beginning--it is the end of the beginning, not the beginning of the end--not only in what he specifically said, but in the fact that last week he announced the appointment of a task force which will now go the next step, particularly in considering reform of the Office of the Secretary of Defense. 
We all have high hopes for the independent National Defense Panel, that was created as part of our legislation, to go further and create clear alternatives and to begin to identify the critical unanswered questions that we are left with after reading the QDR. Then, as Senator Coats has said, it will be up to those of us in Congress and to those in the White House and the administration to absorb the recommendations of the QDR we received today; then of the National Defense Panel which will be presented to us in December; and then to push boldly against the status quo. 
Our responsibility may require us to make difficult decisions about the weapons we buy and where our forces will be based and how they will be structured so that tomorrow's American military will be ready to meet the security threats of the next century in the most cost-effective and technologically dominant way. 
The point is this: Some people will say, `QDR says it all, we're doing well, our security is clear. If it ain't broke, don't fix it.' Of course, we agree our security is strong today and it ain't broke today, but if we don't fix it, it will be broke 10 or 20 years from now, and we will not have fulfilled the fullest measure of our responsibility under the Constitution to provide for and protect the common defense. 
I thank the Chair.

Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank my friend from Indiana for his comments, which I agree with totally. 
Part of what we are saying--I echo him--is the world is changing so dramatically that we must make sure that our national security structure changes as well. There is not a company doing business in America today the way it did 5 or 10 years ago, let alone 30, 40, or 50 years ago. What strikes me as so stunning is that the companies that are doing best today are looking ahead 3, 4, 5, 10 years forward to figure out how they are going to need to change to make sure they are still on top. There are limits to that comparison, but that is what we are trying to do with our national security structure. 
We are, in a sense, being the burrs under the saddle here because we are riding tall in the saddle right now as a country. We are very strong. But history tells us that unless you look forward and change with the times, particularly to begin to absorb the full measure of technological change in your military plans, then you are not going to be riding securely for very long. 
Just to echo a final point, a very important one, when we drafted this legislation, Senators Coats, McCain, Robb, Kempthorne, Levin, and others, and I had in mind that it was not just the Pentagon--as big and bureaucratic, although very effective, an institution as it is--that needed an outside push; it was Congress, it was us because we are as prone to ride along with the successful status quo and not take the painful looks out over the horizon, particularly if they affect us, as some of these changes may. 
So this is the first step. It is an ongoing process. I feel even more strongly that legislation was correct in calling for an independent panel, a national defense panel. And ultimately it will be up to the Armed Services Committees, the Appropriations Committees, and all the Members of both Houses to have the guts to make the tough decisions today that will guarantee that America is strong and secure tomorrow and a lot of tomorrows forward into the 21st century. 
I thank the Presiding Officer, and I yield the floor.

Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I am delighted to join with Senators Mack, Lott, and Brownback as an original cosponsor of this important legislation, the District of Columbia Economic Recovery Act of 1997 (DCERA). 
The District of Columbia belongs to each and every one of us. As citizens of the United States, we have a stake in the successes, and a stake in the failures, of Washington, DC. It is America's city. But, for a variety of reasons, not all of them easily explained, Washington is in desperate financial straits. The here and now financial prospects are grim for the city, and the future gets grimmer. This is largely because middle-class families, the backbone of any successful community, are fleeing the District in alarming numbers. 
The legislation we are introducing today would instantly transform our Nation's capital, making it a more appealing place to live, to invest, to build, to buy, and to work. This bill is designed to reverse the flow of businesses and the middle-class residents who currently are fleeing the city for the suburbs. Those still in the District would have new incentives to stay. And many others now living elsewhere would have a very strong incentive to move into the District with their families and with their businesses. 
We cannot make the schools better in the District overnight. We cannot promise crime-free streets overnight. We cannot promise a revitalized economy overnight. What we can do is provide middle-class tax relief in the District, and as a way to lure these middle-class taxpayers to the District as a way to reestablish a tax base in the District. And once we bring these people back, safer streets and better schools can follow. 
This legislation is modeled on legislation that has been introduced in the House with broad, bipartisan support, by Representative Eleanor Holmes Norton. Both the House and the Senate version of the DCERA establish a maximum Federal tax rate of 15 percent. Both bills double the personal exemption, which would eliminate Federal income taxes for single residents who make up to $15,000 a year and married couples filing jointly who make up to $30,000 a year. At the same time, the bill retains the mortgage and charitable deductions and would allow a taxpayer to file under the old system, if that is what they prefer to do. In contrast to Representative Norton's bill, which provides capital gains tax relief only to D.C. 
residents, our legislation establishes a zero capital gains rate for D.C. investments held by D.C. or non-D.C. residents for 3 years. We believe that the broader exemption is necessary to spur as much investment in the District as possible. Also in contrast to the House DCERA, our bill includes a $5,000 credit for first time District home purchases and includes a provision to clean up abandoned brownfields within the District. Members of Congress not representing the District could not take advantage of the tax incentives in the bill, and the District already has enacted legislation ensuring that it would not take advantage of the Federal tax incentives in this bill by raising local taxes. 
I very much see this bill as a first step. Some of the urban problems Washington faces are unique to Washington because Washington has no State, no broader tax base, to draw on. At the same time, many of Washington's problems are problems that are faced by cities all across this country. If this approach works in Washington, I hope we can try it in Bridgeport, New Haven, and Hartford as well. 
I should note that, unlike some proponents of this legislation, I am at best an agnostic on a flat tax. I believe progressivity in our tax rates is inherently fair and am pleased that the legislation we are introducing today has elements of that progressivity by providing such a generous personal exemption. At the same time, a good number of our cities are facing the loss of their middle-class population and the only way to rebuild that base may be through bold measures like a flat tax which has clear and compelling benefits for the middle class. The people we are really anxious to bring back to our cities are the 28 percenters. Under the current Tax Code a typical family in the 28-percent bracket would be a couple with two children who make roughly between $39,000 and $95,000 after deductions. Our bill would create a very favorable tax incentive for these people to stay in, or move to, the District. 
Mr. President, the most important thing there is to say about urban policy in this country is that we really do not have an urban policy. We know what has not worked; today we are introducing legislation that we believe will work and there is no better place to start than in Washington, DC, a city that belongs to all Americans. I urge my colleagues to join us in cosponsoring this important legislation.

Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, today the Senate once again returns to the morally perplexing question of abortion, a question which has not only divided the Senate and divided America, but I would say that it divides individual Senators and individual Americans. I must say, as I have listened to this debate today, I am proud to be serving here, as difficult as the question before us is, because of the thoughtful, sincere and civil way in which this debate has proceeded. 
We have in front of us two responses to the problem of abortion: one that would prevent use of a specific medical procedure, intact dilation and extraction, which is used for abortion, and, a second that would prevent almost all abortions from being performed after viability. I believe that the second alternative, Senator Daschle's, more broadly and appropriately responds to the mix, the difficult mix, of moral and legal concerns at issue here, and, therefore, I will vote for Senator Daschle's amendment. 
In Pope John Paul II's Encyclical Letter on the Value and Inviolability of Human Life, His Holiness writes that, `The direct and voluntary killing of an innocent human being is always gravely immoral.' I respect, with humility, the depth of the Pope's statement and the moral conviction of millions of Americans of all religions who recoil from abortion and believe that any abortion at any stage of pregnancy is a taking of life. The Pope's statement, and others by those who oppose all abortions regardless of how early in pregnancy are powerful expressions driven by deep convictions and high moral principles. I respect and value the sincerity and depth with which those convictions are held and expressed--certainly so by the Senator from Pennsylvania, who is the sponsor of the underlying proposal. In fact, I personally share many of those convictions. 
But the question for me today--and each of us must decide this personally--remains the same as it was when I was called upon to pass public judgment during my time as a State senator in Connecticut in the 1970's after the Roe v. Wade decision was passed down: What is the appropriate place for my personal convictions about abortion, my personal conviction that potential life begins at conception, and, therefore, my personal conviction that all abortions are unacceptable? How do I relate that appropriately to my role as a lawmaker? 
I struggled with this over and over again in the 1970's in the Connecticut State Senate. How does one, appropriately, as a lawmaker, balance the right of the mother to life, the right of the potential life to protection by the State, and the right of privacy of the woman, the right of the woman to choose, which is recognized by our courts? 
These competing interests that exist throughout the pregnancy are what we in the Senate are called upon, each in our own way, to try to balance and resolve. Our role here, it seems to me, calls on us to resolve that competition in a way that respects and reflects our own convictions, our constituents', and finally our Constitution. 
I was shaken, as I would imagine many Members of the Senate were, as the debate over this partial-birth-abortion ban went on, and it sent me back to the conflicts that I faced in the 1970's in the Connecticut State Senate because the partial-birth abortion, the intact dilation and extraction, is horrific; it is horrifying. Yet, the more I focused on it, the more I got concerned about the number of these abortions that are being performed--and as small as that number is--the number is unacceptable--the more I had 
to face my own personal conclusion that any abortion is unacceptable. Any abortion is horrific. 
It brought me back to the question of what the role of a body of lawmakers is in reconciling the interests of the mother, the interests of the fetus, potential life, and in respecting the judgments of our courts. In the end, again today, I resolve that conflict with a sense of humility about my authority as one lawmaker, about my capacity, about my judgment in the face of the uniquely private personal judgment and right to choose that a woman has up until the point of viability of the fetus, when that right is equalized by the right of the fetus to be protected by the State. 
The amendment in front of us, offered by the Senate Democratic leader, does, in fact, ban all abortions of viable fetuses, regardless of procedure, except where the physician certifies that continuation of the pregnancy threatens the mother's life or risks grievous injury to her physical health. 
It was my honor to work with Senator Daschle, Senator Snowe and many others in preparing this amendment. My personal conclusion, and here I speak as a lawyer, as a former attorney general, is that this amendment will, in fact, ban almost all postviability abortions that might otherwise be performed in this country. 
The definition of the exception, particularly with the addition of the words `physical health' tied to `grievous injury,' is very narrow. Senator Daschle's amendment sets up a procedure where the Department of HHS, Health and Human Services will, in fact, promulgate regulations about certification, will require the doctor to file a certification with the Department. 
What doctor, and there are only a few who perform postviability abortions, would certify inappropriately under the narrow definition in this law and risk losing his or her medical license? Tying the State's protection of the fetus to viability extends protection in a way that I do not believe we have before, to those fetuses that need all the assistance, postviability, that today's technology and medical science make available. It is a remarkable advance, if you will, for the pro-life movement in that regard. 
As I read Senator Daschle's amendment, and I have spoken with him about this and he has spoken to this, it would prevent abortions of any fetus that could survive outside the mother's body with or without life support. I asked him this question, `What about a fetus postviability that a test reveals is disabled or may have Down's syndrome, but yet can survive with life support outside the mother's body?' Senator Daschle said quite clearly to me that is a viable fetus which could not be terminated under his amendment. 
The term `viability' allows the protection of the law to move as medical science advances. When Roe v. Wade was handed down, fetuses under 28 or 29 weeks of gestation were not considered viable. Similarly, for many developmental and genetic defects that led to the death of a fetus or the inability to survive without the mother's bodily support, medicine has found ways to save those babies. Medical science has advanced, and with it, younger and sicker fetuses now are able to live. The term `viability' will allow the Government's responsibility to protect potential human life to move with medical science. 
I want to pick up on something that the Senator from Oklahoma, Mr. Nickles, said a short while ago. The truth is Senator Daschle, Senator Snowe and the others who sponsored this amendment have reached common ground. I think he has established a common ground here that both pro-choice and pro-life Members of this Senate can support. I understand that many will not support it today because it is a substitute for the underlying legislation proposed by Senator Santorum, and the Daschle amendment clearly does not protect fetuses previability. 
But if this amendment fails today, I believe that it is such an advance and provides such an opportunity for common ground that I hope Members of the Senate, regardless of their position on it, on this difficult and perplexing issue, will come together and help us on another day, if not today, pass this legislation. 
I thank the Senate Democratic leader and his staff and all who have worked conscientiously on both sides of the aisle for the thoughtful, constructive approach which will save a lot of fetal life, if it is passed--if and when it is passed. 
I thank the Chair. 
I yield the floor.  
Mr. SANTORUM addressed the Chair.

Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I thank my friend and colleague from Ohio, who has quite graciously allowed me to go forward for a few moments to join my colleague from Connecticut in kind of a statement of pride and gratitude, to commemorate and recognize the birthday this Monday of a beloved constituent but really one of the great motion picture actresses of all time, Katharine Hepburn. 
As Senator Dodd said, we have known Katharine Hepburn in Connecticut not only as one of our own, but as somebody who, quite appropriately, has preserved her privacy. We try our best to do that, and I suppose it is inconsistent to publicly acknowledge that this great lady is approaching her 90th birthday, on May 12. But in this case, we respectfully and humbly break the privacy and want to publicly honor her for the extraordinary career that she has had. 
She grew up in a small Connecticut town and has always consider herself--and still does--the `local girl,' as she puts it. She is the only four-time winner of the Academy Award for best actress, as I say, for the great roles she has played, 3 of which were won after the age of 60. Katharine Hepburn is, in the words of my colleague--and it is interesting that we both chose the same phrase, working independently--a national treasure. 
For nearly 70 years of a brilliant acting career, she has captured the essence of not just what it means to be a great woman and a great person, but the American spirit both on and 
off the silver screen. In her leading roles and in her life, Katharine Hepburn has stood as a symbol of dignity and of independence, someone who, in the best American/New England traditions, has proudly lived life on her own terms, and with it, great results came. 
Katharine Hepburn once said of her home in Connecticut, `I think I'm lucky because people with careers are attracted to the big city and lose track of where they come from. This'--speaking of our State and her beloved town--`is where I come from. I have roots, a sense of belonging somewhere.' 
As much as we are honored that Katharine Hepburn has said she belongs in Connecticut, we are very proud to say that we belong to her and she to us. People around the Old Saybrook section of the State will tell you how thrilled they are to have seen her taking those dips into Long Island Sound, not only in the summer but occasionally in winter, and how grateful they are for the way in which, in her quiet way, she has become involved in the kinds of concerns that local communities have, such as buying a ladder truck for the fire department. She reaches an extraordinary age this Monday and can look back on a remarkable career. 
Katharine Hepburn's artistic brilliance, her outlook on life, her spirit, have served as a beacon of light and of truth for people in America and, really, throughout the world. I am delighted to join with my colleague, and I am sure everyone else in our State and everyone here in the Senate, in thanking her for what she has meant to us as an artist, in expanding our own sense of reality, our own horizons, our own appreciation of life. She reaches a substantial age on Monday, but the truth is that Katharine Hepburn, through the miracle of the movies, is ageless and immortal, forever beautiful, forever graceful, forever magnificently intelligent, forever brilliant, forever spirited, forever Katharine Hepburn. Happy 90th birthday. 
I thank the Chair and yield the floor.

Mr. LIEBERMAN. I share the Senator's concern. Under the COSSI program, DOD intends to make sensible investments that will reduce weapons systems costs in the long run. By upgrading the F-14A/B Inertial System, for example, DOD expects that it could increase the mean time between failures from 40 hours to 4500 hours, substantially reducing program costs over the next decade. Similarly, by installing constant velocity joints in its fleet of M939 5 ton trucks, the Department expects to reduce its tire costs by two-thirds. In my view, we can't afford not to make these kinds of money-saving investments.

Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I share Senator Bingaman's concern about section 305 of the bill, which would eliminate $100 million in funding for DOD's commercial operations and support savings initiative, known as COSSI. Under the COSSI program, DOD plans to insert new commercial technologies into weapons systems to reduce operations and support costs. DOD has learned that for many weapons systems, operations and support costs far exceed acquisition costs. By investing in upgraded commercial technologies with improved performance, the Department hopes to bring operations and support costs down in the long run. 
I am concerned that the elimination of the COSSI program will increase defense costs in the long run. At the same time, I agree that we should not try to fund the COSSI program at the expense of the Department's limited funding for dual use technologies. Senator Bingaman has worked long and hard to establish the Dual Use Program and to keep it going, and this program has shown real benefits for both the Department of Defense and the economy as a whole. I hope that the conferees will be able to find an appropriate level of funding for the COSSI program without undermining the Department's dual use technology initiative.

Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise to speak in opposition to amendment No. 83 offered by the Senator from 
Wisconsin to S. 672, the underlying bill. I gather that Senator Feingold's amendment has been second-degreed by the Senator from Texas with amendment No. 177. 
In brief, the underlying amendment to the supplemental appropriations bill would prohibit the use of funds for ground deployment in Bosnia after September 30 of this year, 1997. The second-degree amendment changes the date of September 30, 1997, to June 30, 1998. 
Mr. President, after all the debate and discussion here on the floor of this Senate for the last 6 years, really after all of the diplomatic effort by our Government and other governments in Europe and throughout the world regarding the conflict in Bosnia, after all of the blood that has been spilled in Bosnia with hundreds of thousands of people displaced and killed, and after the heroic service of the American soldiers that have been part of IFOR and SFOR, joined with soldiers of other countries in separating the warring parties in the former Yugoslavia and stopping the conflict and beginning the peaceful reconstruction of that land, it is fundamentally inconceivable to me that the Senate here on an amendment to this supplemental appropriations bill would direct the military to pull out of this conflict, to walk away, in my opinion, before the job is done, to do something that is not in the best traditions of American diplomacy, let alone the American military. 
So, Mr. President, I strongly oppose these two amendments. 
If I may, I would like to take just a few moments to recall with my colleagues some of what has happened in this Chamber, in the former Yugoslavia, and in the capitals of the world regarding this conflict and why it is as important as I think it is that our actions are as constructive and courageous as I believe they are. This action would be, by virtue of this amendment, without the appropriate hearings by the relevant committees, without hearing from our military and civilian leadership, without even hearing from those such as Ambassador Holbrooke who negotiated the Dayton peace agreement--it would be so wrong for us to adopt these amendments. 
Mr. President, the conflict that broke out in the former Yugoslavia was one of the byproducts, if you will, of the collapse of the former Soviet Union. There are times, of course, when a war is over--in this case I speak of the cold war--when a time of instability and uncertainty prevails, and there are those who will seek to take advantage of that uncertainty with military force to turn the circumstance to their own benefit. That is the context in which I have always viewed the war that broke out in the former Yugoslavia. It is not, as we have said over and over again, that there are any saints in that particular region of the world. 
But it was clear to me that there was an intentional act of war, aggression, and genocide against people based on their religion, for the most part, if they happened to be Bosnian Muslims, by Serbia. That raged on and on--not stopped by the powers in Europe--raged on and on, as we witnessed continually on our television sets one horror after another. It was hard to believe that in the heart of Europe once again so soon after the end of the Second World War we were seeing aggression and genocide, even concentration camps for some period of time. 
We debated this here at great length in this Chamber. The United States, I think for reasons that were misplaced, I believe, in 1991 became part of imposing an arms embargo on the parties in the former Yugoslavia. The aim was to try to avoid 
conflict or to avoid the spread of conflict by keeping arms out of there--apparently well intentioned. Yet, the effect of it was horrendous and devastatingly unfair because the Serbs, by virtue of the division of the country, retained most of the war-fighting capacity and armaments manufacturing capacity of the former Yugoslavia. The Bosnians did not have that capacity. 
So, not only did the world stand by as the war went on and not intervene, but we were prohibiting the Bosnians, the Muslims, from obtaining the arms that they needed to defend their families, their neighbors, and their country. 
Former Senate majority leader, Senator Dole, led the effort to raise the arms embargo. It was a bipartisan effort in which I was honored to join with him in which we contended, if you will, with two successive administrations, one of each political party. 
Finally, after repeated attempts, in the spring of 1995 we were able to obtain a majority in this Chamber to lift the arms embargo. This was in response to one story after another of horror in Srebrenica, in all of that city, mass slaughter of people, discovery of concentration camps with bodies all around. And after that embargo was lifted, an act of real leadership by this administration, by the President, in calling for NATO strikes, which so many of us here continued to say, `Strike from the air. Make the Serbs pay for their aggression.' No one is doing anything to stop them. No one is doing anything which would indicate that the rest of the world cares about what is happening there or will care if this once again becomes a wider war in Europe, bringing in the neighbors all around, including the potential to bring in two of our allies in NATO, namely, Greece and Turkey. 
Force was used. The Serbs responded. The Dayton peace began. Ambassador Holbrooke was sent in by the President in one of the most extraordinary exercises in diplomatic leadership that we have seen in recent times, where the Dayton peace accord was signed leading to the so-called IFOR presence in Bosnia. 
Mr. President, we have been at a fork in the road in Bosnia before, forks that would have, if we took one turn, left the people of Bosnia to their own devices, the outcome to be decided by brute strength and savagery unknown in Europe for 50 years, risking the expansion of that violence to other parts of Europe with possibly much greater harm to our vital interests there. The other fork is the one we ultimately took, to try to stop the violence and bring peace, order, and justice back to the former Yugoslavia. 
The Dayton accords happened because the United States finally exercised its leadership and, with NATO, used collective power to bring the conflict to an end. IFOR was created to assure that territorial and other military-related provisions of the Dayton agreement were achieved. But although stopping the fighting was a necessary condition for achieving the goal of assuring the continuity of the single State of Bosnia and Herzegovina, it was never considered as a sufficient condition for achieving that goal. 
Unfortunately, it was this part of the agreement that received the vast majority of the attention and debate in the United States. American opponents of U.S. participation made dire predictions of disaster and casualties, and the result was a very narrow mission statement and an arbitrary 1-year time limit for IFOR deployment. I opposed that 1-year time limit because I believed that only when IFOR's success could be combined with the implementation of the civilian elements of the agreement at Dayton--rehabilitation of infrastructure, economic reconstruction, political and constitutional institutions in Bosnia-Herzegovina, promotion and respect for human rights, return of displaced persons and pursuit of indicted war criminals--would it be possible for us to end our participation there. 
When some have started to talk about withdrawing on June 30, 1998, I said again I hope that we will be in a position to do that, but has it ever made sense in a military involvement to announce the date by which we are withdrawing, leaving those who would benefit from our withdrawal, who would try to take advantage of it, to lay in wait until that withdrawal, until that withdrawal which would leave them a clear field to proceed back to war and savagery and the threat of a wider conflict which inevitably will cost us more than we have spent to stop the conflict and prevent that wider war in the former Yugoslavia. 
So where are we, Mr. President, in the execution of the tasks we set at Dayton? I would say we are part of the way to our goal. We have officially declared IFOR successful and its mission complete. The first part of that task was accomplished magnificently by our forces. The violence stopped, an environment of relative stability emerged and not one IFOR member, thank God, was killed as a result of military action. This performance was due to the skill and professionalism of the IFOR soldiers, to the reputation accorded NATO and its soldiers and ultimately to the sine quo non of all of this, which is American leadership. 
But executing the essential second part of the task has not been as successful. The progress in rebuilding Bosnia has been slow, due in part to the difficulty of overcoming the antagonism engendered by a tragic war and the effects of a creation of ethnic areas, but it is also due to the fact that rebuilding a country is much harder than stopping the fighting, and we have given far less focus and far less support for the difficult tasks necessary to rebuild Bosnia than we gave to the military tasks. 
The mission of IFOR was very narrowly stated, and we avoided many opportunities for IFOR to support some of the most important civilian parts of the agreement. Most notable to me was our failure to direct IFOR or some international body to apprehend the indicted war criminals that bear such a large part of the responsibility for the afflictions of this fated land, the freedom of which, flaunting the indictment of an internationally constituted war crimes tribunal, will prevent genuine peace in Bosnia from ever occurring. These criminals are still at large. They can be seen, particularly Mr. Karadzic, one of the main perpetrators of the war crimes, indicted by an established international tribunal, seen almost daily controlling so much of what happens in the Serb part of Bosnia, still at large. And that freedom remains a profoundly serious impediment to attempts to build a civil society with functioning democratic institutions. 
Still we have made progress. The efforts of Ambassador Holbrooke reduced but clearly did not eliminate the deleterious effects of the war criminals. Elections for national leaders have been held. The government is functioning. So we have reason to be 
extremely grateful for the military and political successes that have been achieved. These successes have been extraordinarily important. 
Today we come to another fork in the road as a result of these amendments not considered at length by this Chamber, certainly not yet. As before, one fork would leave the people of Bosnia to their own devices regardless of what the condition on the ground was, first on September 30 of this year, an extraordinarily early date, and then on June 30, 1998. If we take the fork that leads to withdrawal on a date certain, it is axiomatic, it is without doubt that our NATO allies will follow us on the way out. They have said repeatedly: We went in together; we are going to go out together. This will probably lead either to the renewal of violence, bloodshed, genocide, rule of those willing to deploy the most savage force. At least I would guess it will lead to partition. 
Some will say that does not matter, but I believe it matters a great deal, not just to the people of Bosnia but to stability in Europe, which has always mattered to the United States--in fact, drew us into two world wars in this century at the cost of thousands of American lives. 
I have always seen our involvement in Bosnia as preventive. It is an attempt to prevent a wider conflict that would cost us more in blood, American blood, American lives and, yes, American money. As Ambassador Holbrooke recently pointed out in a letter in Foreign Affairs:  
A single Bosnia with two entities was the essential core of the Dayton agreements. The boundary line was to be similar to a boundary between two American States rather than a boundary between two nations. But the Serbs were at Dayton under duress and few expected they would voluntarily accept such a concept. Indeed, they have acted to undermine execution of the political and economic tasks, and are trying to turn the boundary line into a line of partition and ultimately into one of complete separation. 
Mr. President, why is partition, which I would see as the least devastating result of a hasty American retreat from Bosnia, why is it wrong? In my opinion, it is wrong morally, strategically and politically. Partition of Bosnia would be morally wrong because it would reward the aggression and the genocide that all of us have decried. But it would also be dangerous. 
Partition is strategically wrong because it contains within it seeds of violence. The history of places where partition has occurred is sad and bloodied, and they all continue to draw us into their sadness and blood. Ireland and Cyprus are examples that still threaten America and threaten the international order as a result of partition after many decades. The problems engendered by partition in Bosnia would, in my opinion, be even worse because Bosnia would end up partitioned not just into two parts but into three parts--the Muslim part, the Serbian part, and the Croatian part. The endless battles over the partition lines would have a high probability of impacting others in the neighborhood--Albania, Greece, Bulgaria and Macedonia. And partition is particularly politically wrong because it would send a profoundly undesirable signal to ethnic activists in other places where boundaries were arbitrarily drawn and which politically divide historic ethnic groups, and that is that aggression will be rewarded with partition. 
Mr. President, if we were to withdraw in June 1998, let alone September 30, 1997, without successful implementation of Dayton's civil tasks, the Serb strategy will have succeeded. The fact is that, setting these amendments aside, soon we will conduct the first of the periodic assessments of SFOR, the follow-on force to IFOR. While these assessments might be envisioned by some as opportunities to determine if we can withdraw our forces even faster, I believe we should use them in an orderly, thoughtful way as opportunities to conduct a real debate about how we can successfully conclude all the tasks laid out at Dayton and achieve the objective we agreed on: A single Bosnia, where peace, justice, and the rule of law prevail. 
Mr. President, there are lives on the line here and they are American lives as well as Bosnian lives. We ought not after the money we have invested, the lives we have risked, the conflict we have stopped, the blood we have saved, the order we have returned to Europe, the larger war we have avoided, by virtue of an amendment not heard by the relevant committees direct the end of what up until this time has been a signal act of American leadership, American courage, American preventive diplomacy, American force used in the interest of peace and order and justice. 
So I strongly oppose the amendment, and I urge my colleagues to do the same. I thank the Chair. 
Mr. BIDEN addressed the Chair.

 Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to acknowledge Adam J. Platzner. Adam arrived at the Kind & Low-Heywood Thomas School [KLHT] in September 1994--sophomore year. Almost immediately following his arrival he was elected by his classmates to the Student Government as a case representative. He was appointed by the Student Government president to the position of direction of Student Government Development. He was also appointed chairman of the Constitution Committee. In these posts he not only raised money but he also supervised the formation of, and coauthored the new Student Government's constitution. Through his efforts the students now have representation on the board of trustees' committees. In the middle of April 1994, Mr. Platzner among other things, founded and was elected chairman of the Political Union. He was also elected vice president of the Student Body and chairman of the Student Council. Adam Platzner was chosen to represent the school as the ambassador to the Hugh O'Brien Youth Foundation's annual conference. 
The following year--junior year--Mr. Platzner raised funds and chaired the Student Council. He was also selected to sit on the board of trustees' education committee--2-year term--and elected president of the Model United Nations Organization. Adam Platzner won the Outstanding Delegate Award at the Ivy League Model United Nations Conference, as well as the class prize for his hard work, leadership, and dedication In the city of New Rochelle, NY, Mr. Platzner was appointed to the Youth Court.

 Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, for the past 2 1/2 years, members of the Senate Committee on Armed Services have been privileged to work with Dr. Paul G. Kaminski, who is serving as the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Technology. Dr. Kaminski has led the Department of Defense through the most significant reform of the Nation's defense acquisition system in 50 years. I believe it is appropriate for the Senate to recognize the outstanding service rendered the Nation by Dr. Kaminski on the occasion of his retirement from Federal service later this spring. 
During his tenure as the Defense Acquisition Executive, Dr. Kaminski established the broad outlines of the technologies and systems that will form the cutting edge of this Nation's defense capabilities well into the next century. His scientific counsel and leadership were instrumental in charting a course ahead for a system of systems including this Nation's national security space systems, heavy bomber force, air mobility force, ballistic and cruise missile defense, tactical air forces, and attack submarine fleet. 
Dr. Kaminski ushered in a new era--a renaissance--in armaments cooperation with our friends and allies around the world. His vision, foresight and diplomacy have provided this Nation and our international partners with a broad spectrum of collaborative efforts and opportunities that include cooperation with Germany and Italy to develop a medium extended air defense system; cooperation with France, Germany, Italy, and Spain to develop, produce, and field an interoperable multifunctional information distribution system; and cooperation with the United Kingdom, Norway, and the Netherlands on the development of a revolutionary new joint strike fighter. 
As steward of the Nation's defense acquisition system, Dr. Kaminski has guided the defense acquisition establishment through a period of revolutionary change and reform. He has changed the way our acquisition system supports America's soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines. Through establishment of integrated product teams--composed of war fighters, testers, trainers, doctrine writers, acquirers, and their industry contractors--Dr. Kaminski has dramatically improved the way weapon systems are developed, produced, and fielded. Perhaps Dr. Kaminski's greatest accomplishment is the pride and professionalism he has reinvigorated in the acquisition work force supporting our war fighters. The American people can take comfort in the fact that the U.S. defense acquisition work force is the very finest in the world. Our people are willing to think `out-of-the-box' and pushing hard to be better. 
Dr. Kaminski has been responsible for initiating a wholesale re-engineering of the DOD logistics system. He recognized that for the revolution in U.S. military affairs to proceed--the DOD needed a new, compatible logistics support concept. His approach was to substitute information and fast transportation for inventory. As a result of his leadership and vision, logistics response times have improved significantly and inventories have been reduced dramatically. 
His reputation is well known in Congress--to those who have worked directly with him and even many who have not. He is highly respected as an individual of integrity, vision, scientific brilliance, and that rare trait of objectivity about what he is involved in. His work will continue to have a very profound and lasting impact upon the Nation's security for many years to come. The Nation owes a debt of gratitude to Dr. Kaminski. It has been my distinct pleasure to be associated with this exceptional public servant in conjunction with my duties on the Armed Services Committee. I wish him well and anticipate that his coming years in the private sector will further contribute to the security of this Nation. My best wishes to Paul, his lovely wife Julia, and his two children Laura and Garrett, as they mark this special milestone.

Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I would like to take a few moments to pay tribute to Patrick H. Windham, the long-serving Senior Democratic Professional Staff Member for the Subcommittee on Science, Technology and Space. Pat is leaving Washington for California with his wife Arati Prabhakar and newborn baby Katie after nearly 20 years of service to the Senate, primarily on science and technology policy issues. For the many people here who knew or worked with Pat, including my staff and me, he will be sorely missed as a great source of institutional knowledge but most of all as a friend, a genuine and nice guy in a town not always known for its friendliness. 
Originally from California, Pat completed his undergraduate work at Stanford, received a Masters in public policy from the University of California at Berkeley and first came to the Hill in 1976 as a Congressional Fellow to the Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation. In 1982 Pat began his long association with Senator Hollings, joining his personal staff as a legislative assistant. He has held his present position of Senior Democratic Professional staff member for the Subcommittee on Commerce, Science and Transportation since 1984. 
I met Pat through his many hours of work on the important issue of technology partnerships, especially those run through the Commerce Department such as the Advanced Technology Program. Pat, along with my able colleague Senator Hollings, has been a tireless advocate of promoting the movement of new ideas generated by scientists and engineers in our universities and national laboratories out into the commercial marketplace. Widely respected for his substantive thinking on such topics, Pat has tirelessly worked on legislative solutions that would bridge the cultural gap existing between the differing worlds of academia, government and industry. I believe this effort to be critical towards ensuring the future ability of America to compete in a global market. 
During World War II and the subsequent Cold War, federal investment in science and technology was seen as essential to maintaining America's national security. A by-product of federal investment was an infrastructure of world-leading high tech defense companies, laboratories and universities and subsequent creation of an entire new generation of products and industries. With the end of the Cold War, the defense rationale for continued investment is not as politically compelling and the growth of information technologies continues to change the landscape for American business. 
We are now in a period of transition, looking for ways to move from the old system of innovation where the government funded the science, paid for development and then purchased the final product--to a new system that preserves both our country's security and its competitive economic advantage. It is not an exaggeration to say that Pat has been a major contributor in the development of science and technology policy during this turbulent transition period. My office and I particularly respect his work for Senator Hollings as an architect of both the Advanced Technology Program and the Manufacturing Extension Program, both of which help move technology and information out to the manufacturing floors of America's workplaces. Pat has always been open minded, has carefully listened and will be remembered as a joy to work with. My staff and I hope that Pat will find some time to write and reflect on the technology policy issues he's been grappling with for so long, and welcome fresh insights from him. The Senate owes him a large debt of thanks for his fine work here. Good luck in California, Pat, and best wishes to your wonderful wife and daughter.

Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I am here today with Senators McConnell, Moynihan, Gorton, and Grams to introduce the Auto Choice Reform Act of 1997. If enacted, this bill would save American consumers tens of billions of dollars, while at the same time producing an auto insurance system that operates more efficiently and promises drivers better and quicker compensation. 
America's drivers are plagued today by an auto accident insurance and compensation system that is too expensive and that does not work. Each of us currently pays an average of $785 annually for our auto insurance per car. This is an extraordinarily large sum, and one that is particularly difficult for people of modest means--and almost impossible for poor people--to afford. A study of Maricopa County, AZ drives this point home. That study found that families living below 50 percent of the poverty line spend nearly one-third of their household income on premiums when they purchase auto insurance. 
Perhaps those costs would be worth it if they meant that people injured in car accidents were fully compensated for their injuries. But under our current tort system, that often is not the case, particularly for people who are seriously injured. Because of the need to prove fault and the ability to receive compensation only through someone else's insurance policy, some injured drivers--like those in one car accidents or those who are found to have been at fault themselves--are left without any compensation at all. Others must endure years of litigation before receiving any compensation for their injuries. In the end, people who suffer minimal injuries in auto accidents generally end up overcompensated, while victims of serious injuries often fail to receive full restitution. According to a study by Rand's Institute for Civil Justice, people who suffer economic losses--lost wages and medical bills, for example--in the range of $25,000 to $100,000 currently are compensated for just over one-half of their losses on average. The very seriously injured--those with economic losses of over $100,000--receive compensation worth just 9 percent of those damages on average. Much of this shortfall is due to the high transaction costs--the 33-percent attorneys' fee regularly taken out of a plaintiff's recovery, for one thing--associated with the current system. 
These statistics show that our auto insurance and compensation laws violate the cardinal rule I think those of us in the business legislating have a duty to follow: to draft our laws to encourage people to minimize their disputes, and to encourage those who do have disputes to resolve them as efficiently, as economically, and as quickly as possible. 
This is particularly true when we are dealing with laws impacting on people who are physically injured, because injured people simply--and literally--cannot afford to wait the years it often takes for a lawsuit to wind its way through our legal system. The laws governing our auto accident and insurance system do not now meet those simple criteria. They instead require consumers to pay extraordinarily high premiums to purchase auto insurance. That auto insurance, in turn and as a result of our broken legal system, does not bring seriously injured people either speedy or full compensation for their injuries. 
My colleagues and I set out to rethink the legal framework governing our car insurance and compensation system. We asked ourselves whether we could write a law that would both lower premiums and better compensate people for injuries suffered in car accidents. Why, we wondered, should people hurt in car crashes--people who have bought and paid for insurance policies--not be able to receive compensation for their injuries unless they find someone else who was at fault, sue them, engage in potentially years of litigation, and collect from that other person? Why, we asked, couldn't auto insurance instead be more like health and homeowner insurance, where people know when they buy their policies that they will be compensated immediately for any covered injury, regardless of who caused the injury and without having to find and pay a lawyer and often suffer through years of litigation? 
The answer we came up with was that there is no reason not to change our auto insurance and compensation laws to address these problems. Our Auto Choice proposal would address these problems by introducing reason into our auto insurance and accident laws. The bill would produce a system that would guarantee immediate compensation to injured people. At the same time, it would bring tremendous savings to the system--up to $45 billion annually according to a recent study. And, it would do so, not by forcing people to do something they do not want to do, but by giving them the choice--the right to determine for themselves what is in their best interests. 
Here's how our plan would work: All drivers would be required to purchase a certain minimum level of insurance, but they would get to choose the type of coverage they want. Those drivers who value immediate compensation for their injuries and lower premiums would be able to purchase what we call personal protection insurance. If the driver with that type of coverage is injured in an accident, he or she would get immediate compensation for all economic losses--things like lost wages, medical bills and attorneys fees--up to the limits of his or her policy, without regard to who was at fault in the accident. 
If their economic losses exceeded those policy limits, the injured party could sue the other driver for the extra economic loss on a fault basis. The only thing the plaintiff could not do is sue the other driver for noneconomic losses, the so-called pain and suffering damages. 
Those drivers who did not want to give up the ability to collect pain and suffering damages could choose a different option, called tort maintenance coverage. Drivers with that type of policy would be able to cover themselves for whatever level of economic and 
noneconomic damages they want, and they would then be able to collect those damages, also from their own insurance company, after proving fault. 
As I mentioned earlier, the savings from this new Choice system would be dramatic. According to a newly released report from the Joint Economic Committee, if all American drivers opted for personal protection insurance, they would save an average of $243 annually on their auto insurance premiums. Drivers in my home State of Connecticut would see even better savings, putting an additional $383 per year into their pockets. All told, the American economy could save up to $45 billion each and every year under our proposal. 
Our Auto Choice plan, I think, both serves the reform goals I discussed above and incorporates all of the lessons we learned during our past experiences with no-fault laws. It ensures that most injured people would be compensated immediately and that we all can purchase auto insurance at a reasonable rate. As I said at the outset, we as legislators do our best when we make sure that our legal system minimizes the potential for disputes in society and facilitates the resolution of those disputes that exist. The Auto Choice law would do exactly that. It would ensure that something tens of thousands of us now have disputes about--who should compensate whom for car accidents--no longer would be the subject of disputes because everyone who is injured will know from the outset that they will be compensated, they will know by whom they will be compensated, and they will know they will be compensated without having to sue someone else first. Mr. President, this bill would be a boon to the American driver and to the American economy. I look forward to working with my colleagues to see it enacted into law.

Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I'm delighted to join with Senator Moynihan and Senators Lautenberg, Chafee, Dodd, and numerous other colleagues to introduce the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Reauthorization Act of l997. 
As a member of the Environment and Public Works Committee, I was proud to have worked hard with Senator Moynihan and others to craft ISTEA in l991. Without a doubt, ISTEA was the most significant and innovative transportation legislation of a generation. It recognized that our Nation is now reaching a maturing system of transportation. With our Interstate system built, ISTEA moved us to also focus on maintenance, intermodalism, efficiency, funding flexibility, and environmental protection. 
So often today we hear complaints about laws and programs that don't work. ISTEA is a law that has worked and is working--very well. It's one area where we don't need to reinvent government--we did that in l991 when we adopted ISTEA. That's why Governors, mayors, county officials, guilders unions, environmental groups, planners, businessmen and women, and others are telling us to reauthorize the law with minimal change. That was the resounding message I heard in Connecticut at a forum yesterday from a broad range of interests. 
Let me spend a few minutes reviewing why ISTEA is so important. 
In a very unique way, ISTEA combines this country's long-standing commitment to our national priorities--a national system of transportation central to our economic growth and our commitment to protecting and enhancing our environment--with a new emphasis on responding to local conditions, priorities, and interests and involving the public in this decisionmaking process.

 Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to honor a national organization based in my district in Connecticut and headed by Col. George F. Keyes USMC (ret.), its current president. The Marine Cadets of America was founded in Connecticut in 1958 and is in its 39th year of operation, and although its mission has drastically changed and is geared to diverting children from falling prey to drugs and alcohol, it also provides children with a wholesome environment by teaching leadership skills, CPR, vocational skills, and a regular camping and survival program along with physical fitness and water sports. The men and women that serve as adult advisors and role models all serve without pay as volunteers and donate their professional skills to the children of this program. I congratulate and commend these men and women for their efforts and wish them every success in the continued efforts of this outstanding youth program.

Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, this month we observe the 52d anniversary of the beginning of the end of World War II, and the liberation of victims of the Holocaust in Europe. Just 2 years ago, the 50th anniversary of the war's end, there were many ceremonies, memorials, books, articles, and television programs marking the events of 1945. Now, much of the world's attention seems focused on the coming millennium, and the beginning of the 21st century. 
But we must not allow ourselves to forget those events of the 20th century that continue to shape our lives. And we must never allow humanity to forget the awful truth of the Holocaust, for if we do, we risk unleashing the horror of that time on the world once again. The act of remembrance becomes more difficult with each passing year, for there remain fewer and fewer eyewitnesses to history. Fewer survivors of the Holocaust remain. Fewer liberators are alive to tell what they saw with their own eyes. 
And so it falls upon us, the children of the survivors and the liberators, the victims and the witnesses, to carry this burden into the new century, to tell our own children all we know about the horrors visited upon the world a little more than five decades ago, and to pray that what is our history remains history. 
Mr. President, a short while ago, a distinguished American statesman, Paul Wolfowitz, said, `Our goal, as we enter the 21st century, is to make sure that it does not repeat the 20th century,' which is to say the two world wars, the cold war, and all that occurred within it. 
Today, I wish to speak briefly about one event in the history of the Holocaust and World War II, and that is the liberation of Dachau, the anniversary of which falls less than 3 weeks from today. And I will do so in the words of the 42d Rainbow Infantry Division's `History of World War II,' written shortly after the war's end:  
That word, Dachau, is one which few men of the Rainbow will ever forget. They had heard of Nazi concentration camps and believed or half-believed the stories of the SS atrocities and brutalities conducted in them. Soon they were to see the most famous of all German horror prisons. The oldest such camp in Germany, its very name was feared. Men and women who entered those massive stone gates as prisoners never came out. Inside them was practiced systematic murder. Men who had seen friends die and witnessed all the horrors or war were to turn pale and sick at what they saw at Dachau . . . 
As the first American entered the prison the 33,000 inmates went wild with joy and at the same time joined in the battle against the SS, some of whom had changed into prisoners striped uniform in an attempt to escape. 
The first hysterical group to see the Americans rushed and were pushed into an electrified fence which surrounded the principal enclosure and several of them were killed. As the Americans entered the enclosure they rushed to them and tried to throw their arms around them. . . . 
The men of the Second Battalion began moving through the camp. Everywhere they saw sights which filled them with horror. 
Drawn up on sidings outside the camp itself they found 50 boxcars, each one filled with about 30 men who had either starved to death in these cars or had been killed by the machine guns of the guards when they tried to escape. . . . 
In the camp itself there were bodies everywhere. The majority of the guards had fled the night before the Rainbowmen arrived, but before they left they had roamed through the camp killing important prisoners or persons against whom they bore a grudge. . . . Then the guards decided this method was too slow and they turned their machine guns on the inmates. Before they stopped and fled they had killed more than 2,000 in an orgy of murder. Inmates of the camp had gathered these bodies into piles, stacking them up like cordwood. . . . 
Toward the end [of the war] . . . the Nazis had run out of coal and had no way to cremate the bodies, but still the business of murder by gas continued and hundreds of others died of starvation. These bodies the Rainbowmen found dumped into open graves or thrown into the moat until they dammed the water. The stench of the camp was nauseating and in the huts in which the inmates lived the odor was overpowering. Beaten, tortured and starved by the guards, some of these people had become little more than animals. . . . 
Dachau was a nightmare to all the men of the Division who saw it . . . but it was also a lesson. `Now I know why we are fighting,' man after man said. `The Nazis who conceived such a place as that were madmen and those people who operated it were insane. We cannot live in the same world with them. . . .' 
Mr. President, I have had the honor of meeting some of the veterans of the Rainbow Division, and they have always carried with them the terrible memory of Dachau. And yet, as heroic as their work in fighting the Nazis and liberating the victims of the Holocaust was, to a man they deny any special attention. Like so many men of their generation who did their duty, they simply say, `we had a job to do, and we did it.' In so doing, they defended not only the security of the United States of America. They demonstrated that to be human was to be capable of great acts of courage and goodness, even in the face of unspeakable cowardice and evil. 
Mr. President, I have had the honor of meeting several of the veterans of that Rainbow Division, and they have always carried with them terrible memories of Dachau. Yet, as heroic as their work in fighting Nazis and liberating the victims of the Holocaust was, to a man they denied any special attention. They pushed it aside like so many men in our generation who did their duty. They simply say over and over again, `We had a job to do and we did it.' In so doing, they defended not only the security of the United States of America; they demonstrated that to be human was to be capable of great acts of courage and goodness, even in the face of unspeakable cowardice and evil. 
Mr. President, in closing, I would like to make special mention of two people involved in this one story of the Holocaust and the liberation of Dachau. One is a constituent, Robert T. Kennedy, of Wallingford, CT, who at age 32 was drafted into the Army, in part because of his expertise in radio technology, and despite the fact he had a heart condition. Like so many others of his generation, he answered the call of duty, even though it meant leaving his wife, Beatrice, and 6-month-old son, Bobby, at home. Young Bob was nearly 3 when his dad finally returned from the war. Sergeant Kennedy was a member of the Rainbow Division, and he witnessed the horrors of Dachau. And he made sure to tell his children all about the concentration camp, even at an age when they could barely grasp its meaning. He spoke of the rage he and his fellow soldiers felt for those who made torture and murder a way of life, and he told of how the men of the Rainbow forced the civilian townspeople of Dachau to march up to the nearby camp and see for themselves what most, if not all, of them surely must have known was occurring for so many years. Sergeant Kennedy passed away in 1976, but the memory of his service lives on in the hearts of his family. 
Another person who was there, in that same dark corner of the Earth at the same moment in history as Sergeant Kennedy and the men of the Rainbow Division, was Ella Wieder, an inmate first at Auschwitz, and then at Dachau-Allach, a subcamp of Dachau also liberated at the end of April 1945. 
Apparently, it was her work as a slave laborer that, fortunately, stood in the way of her termination long enough for her to survive the Holocaust. After the war she returned to her native Czechoslovakia, and met Rabbi Samuel Freilich. They married, and soon thereafter gave birth to a daughter, Hadassah, who is my wife, and the mother of our child, Nana. 
Mr. President, I tell this story with some feeling today particularly because for the last 17 years Sgt. Robert Kennedy's son, Jim Kennedy, has been my spokesman, my press secretary, my communications director, my muse, and, best of all, my friend. 
Tomorrow, after these 17 years in the movement of life that is inevitable, Jim Kennedy, who for the first time is sitting by my side on the floor, is leaving the service of the U.S. Government, and, more particularly, work at my own office, to go on to a wonderful opportunity in the private sector in New York. 
I cannot thank him enough, and I appreciate the opportunity to do so publicly, not just for the extraordinary eloquence and hard work that he has brought to our work together but to the profound sense of values carrying on the heroism of his father and his family that he has brought to his work with me, to his personal life, to his marriage, and to his fatherhood. I cannot thank him enough. I will miss him. But I wish him all of God's blessings in the years ahead. 
I know that, though we will not be working together, our friendship will go on for as long as the Good Lord gives us the opportunity to be alive on this Earth. 
Mr. President, life goes on, despite the efforts of the Nazis and so many others to snuff it out. With this tremendous yearning and quest to realize the rights that our Constitution and Declaration of Independence enshrines to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness we prevail. And with those rights, however, comes the responsibility of caring for the lives of others. That means remembering the past and its shameful secrets in a way that secures a more hopeful future. It means carrying forth the lessons of the 20th century into the 21st, and telling the stories of the heroes, like Sgt. Kennedy, and the villains of this time in hopes that future generations will never know the enormous terror that once ruled in the dismal environs of Dachau not so long ago. And it means being grateful to all those here at the Senate, like Jim Kennedy who helped people like me give service to the public, and hopefully in that service make this a freer, better country and world. 
I thank you, Mr. President, and I yield the floor.

Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I am proud to join again with Senator Roth in this effort to designate the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge as a wilderness area. 
This legislation would save the American people the huge social and environmental costs of unwise and unnecessary development of one of nature's crown jewels. The Arctic National Wildlife Refuge is the last complete Alaskan wilderness with elements of each tundra ecosystem, the biological heart of the North Slope of Alaska. It is on a par with our other great national resources, including the Grand Canyon, Yellowstone, Jackson Hole, the Badlands, Glacier Bay, and Denali. This is a unique piece of God's Earth that must be preserved for our entire Nation for centuries to come. 
Make no mistake, environmental impacts to the Arctic National Refuge from oil development would be severe and irreversible. The refuge includes the calving grounds for one of the largest caribou herds in North America, the Porcupine herd--152,000 strong. Native American customs have centered around the herd's annual migration for at least 20,000 years. The refuge is a treasure chest of plants, animals, and wilderness unique to the world in terms of abundance, diversity, and value to humankind. Over 200 species of plants and animals thrive in the refuge, including muskoxen, snow geese, Arctic foxes, Arctic grayling, and Arctic char. It is the only natural area in the United States with all three species of North American bears--the black bear, the grizzly bear and the polar bear. It is one of the most natural areas in our Nation, untouched by development, and the last of its kind. 
Many environmental studies demonstrate that the negative environmental effects of opening the Arctic Refuge to development will be severe. Biologists from Federal and State agencies and universities have concluded that oil development will harm the calving of the caribou herd, and reduce its long term numbers very significantly. The Office of Management and Budget has stated that `exploration and development activities would bring physical disturbances to the area, unacceptable risks of oil spills and pollution, and long-term effects that would harm wildlife for decades.' Raymond Cameron, formerly of the Alaska Department of Fish and Game, documented that 19 percent fewer calves are born to caribou cows on developed lands as opposed to undeveloped lands, with a 2-percent margin of error. His study also documented that caribou cows miss yearly calving at a 36-percent rate in developed areas, versus only 19 percent in undeveloped areas. Even a small change in calving success can lead to long-term population declines. A study by the State of Alaska showed that the Arctic caribou herd at Prudhoe Bay declined from 23,400 to 18,100--23 percent--since 1992. All the population decline occurred in habitat affected by oil development, while herds in undeveloped areas grew slightly. Biologists fear that development impacts would be proportionately greater on the herd that uses the Arctic Refuge. 
The amount of oil that potentially can be recovered from the Arctic Refuge is simply too small to affect our energy security, and too destructive to the environment to be worth it. A 1995 assessment of petroleum reserves by the U.S. Geological Survey reported that there is a 95-percent chance that only 148 million barrels of oil exist in the refuge. This would amount to a drop in the national oil bucket--an 8-day supply. Even if the USGS high estimate were correct, the refuge would hold at most a 290-day supply for the United States. 
We can all hope for another strike like Prudhoe Bay. But the simple reality, based on the very best geological science and economics available today, is that alternative energy supplies, as well as the real energy savings from national energy conservation programs, are far more reliable, tangible, and less destructive energy sources than a wild gamble with the Alaskan wilderness. 
The remaining 90 percent of the Alaskan North Slope is already open to oil and gas leasing. Is it too much to protect what little we have left? Every reliable national poll conducted on this issue shows Americans of all political persuasions are against development in the refuge by a more than three to one margin. Let's honor our history of conservation and protect the future for generations to come, by saving the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.

 Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to honor Congregation Kol Haverim of Glastonbury, CT, in recognition of the groundbreaking for its new synagogue building held on April 13, 1997. Through sheer determination, a singleness of purpose and spirit, as well as the considerable generosity of its members and the community at large, this congregation of 200 families is now realizing a dream that no one would have thought possible only a few short years ago. 
Congregation Kol Haverim was formed only 13 years ago by a handful of Jewish families in the Glastonbury area, worshiping initially in the back-room of a local grocery store, and later purchasing a former Knights of Columbus hall that serves as its present one room home. Over the past 2 years, the congregation has raised over $1.3 million and its architects have designed a new building, to be added as an addition to the existing facility, that has been praised by local town planning and zoning officials as a model of design for new construction in the area. 
In addition to attending to the spiritual needs of its members through worship services and its ever-growing religious school, Congregation Kol Haverim has always tried to attend to the needs of the local community and Greater Hartford, as well, through its various adult education, community outreach, and other programs. Whether through sponsoring a lecture or the volunteers it regularly provides to local soup kitchens or its participation in area-wide food or clothing drives, Congregation Kol Haverim, like other houses of worship in the area, has always strived to give of itself to the surrounding communities from which it draws its strength. The new building will provide a pleasant and welcoming new home for sacred study, communal worship, and social action. 
I congratulate Congregation Kol Haverim, as it begins this new chapter in its existence. I thank its members for their initiative and all the good work they have done over the past 13 years, and I encourage them to continue to address all the good work that remains to be done.

Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise to make a few remarks concerning Arnold Aronson. For some Americans, civil rights is a cause. For others, civil rights has been a crusade. For Arnold Aronson, civil rights has been his life. 
In his quiet, effective, persistent way, Arnold Aronson fought the battles that too many Americans simply talked about. It made no difference whether the victims were Jewish workers or Protestant pastors, black adults or white children, Arnold Aronson knew that there was only one American dream and that it applied to all Americans. 
Arnold Aronson has over the last half century worked with all the big names in civil rights, Americans like A. Philip Randolph and Roy Wilkins. But Arnold Aronson should not be honored for the big names for whom he worked but for the countless millions who he worked so hard to help. 
Arnold Aronson once said: `The struggle for civil rights cannot be won by any one group acting by or for itself alone but only through a coalition of groups that share a common commitment to equal justice and equal opportunity for every American.' 
For Arnold Aronson, opportunity knew no boundaries of age, race, or religion. Opportunity was simply a principle to be lived and practiced, consistently, lovingly, and most of all, together. 
From his work with the Bureau on Jewish employment in Chicago in 1941 to his presidency of the Leadership Conference Education Fund for the past decade, Arnold Aronson has turned that principle of opportunity for all into his life's mission.

Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I am proud today to join with my colleagues Senator Brownback, DeWine, and Kohl in introducing the Television Program Improvement Act of 1997, a bill we believe will help directly address the public's concerns about the declining standards of television and that will hopefully lead the television industry to exercise more responsibility for the programming it puts on the air. 
The industry has tried in part to respond to the concerns of parents about the negative influence television is having on children by creating a rating system for sex, violence, and vulgar content. This system is a good start, but there is a general consensus it does not go far enough in providing parents with the information they need to make wise choices for their children. 
When I recently testified before the Senate Commerce Committee on this issue, I tried to get this point across by comparing the industry's system to putting up a sign in front of shark-infested waters that said `Be careful when swimming.' That is to say that, while these ratings provide a warning to the viewer, they don't tell us why we need to be warned. 
But I also used this metaphor to make a larger point, which is regardless of how informative the ratings are, what parents really want is to get the sharks out of the water, to improve the quality of programming on the air, and make it safe for their kids to go swimming again. 
The intent of the legislation we are introducing today, the Television Program Improvement Act of 1997, is to reiterate that message and to urge the industry to focus on what's at the heart of this debate over the TV rating system--a very real, broadly-felt concern that television has become a destructive force in our society and it is doing substantial damage to the hearts, minds, and souls of our children. 
This bill really amounts to a plea on our part to the industry for their help. Moreover, it is an attempt to move this debate beyond the question of rights, which we all accept, acknowledge and support, and begin talking more about responsibilities. 
Specifically, the kind of responsibility that broadcasters once embraced through a comprehensive code of conduct, in which they acknowledged the enormous power they commanded and the need to wield it carefully, and in which they recognized that they had an obligation under the law to serve the public interest. I would urge my colleagues to take a look at some of the standards the Nation's broadcasters set for themselves in the old NAB TV 
Code, which we've excerpted in the findings of our legislation, and you'll see that they are quite remarkable statements of responsibility. 
After reading these principles, I would urge my colleagues to compare them to some of the comments made recently by industry leaders, such as the network official who proclaimed `it is not the responsibility of network television to program for the children of America,' or the MTV executive who said his network `is not safe for kids' but markets it directly to them anyway. 
Watch what these programmers are bringing into our homes today, and it is clear that the face of television has changed dramatically since the industry abandoned the old NAB Code in 1983 and abandoned the ethic undergirding it. It is also clear that while the networks have profited from the resulting competition downward, it is the American family who is paying the price--in the form of the awful daytime talk shows that parade the most perverse forms of behavior into our living rooms and teach our children the worst ways to settle conflicts, and the excesses of prime-time comedies that amount to little more than what we used to call dirty jokes. 
The rise of these programs leave little doubt that this debate is about much more than the threat of violence--which was the reason for the original Television Program Improvement Act sponsored by Senator Simon in 1990--although this threat remains a serious problem. What is driving so much of the public's concern is the deluge of casual sex and vulgarities that characterizes so much of television today. The collective force of these messages leaves parents feeling as if they are in a losing struggle to raise their own children, to give them strong values, to teach them right from wrong and guide them to acceptable forms of behavior. 
With the bill we're introducing today, we are asking the television industry to do no more than what it did as recently as the early 1980's, and that is to draw some lines that they will not go below, to declare, as author and noted commentator Alan Ehrenhalt has said, `that some things are too lurid, too violent, or too profane for a mass audience to see.' 
If the industry is not willing to refill that responsible role, there will be increasing pressure on the Government to do it for them. One of the most telling polls I've seen recently appeared in the Wall Street Journal, which showed that 46 percent of Americans favor more Government controls on television to protect children. It's not a coincidence that there are bills being prepared in Congress that would in fact censor what is on the air. 
Our legislation is designed to help us avoid reaching that point. It will ideally remind the industry of its obligations to the public we both serve, and that changing the subject, as some in the industry prefer to do, won't change the minds of the millions of American families who want programming that reflects rather than rejects their values. Again, to return to my metaphor, we are simply making a plea to the industry to take the sharks out of the water, and make it safe for our kids to go swimming, or perhaps more aptly, to go channel-surfing again.

Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Chair. I thank my distinguished colleague from South Carolina. 
Mr. President, I am here to express my support for Senate Joint Resolution 18, introduced by the Senator from South Carolina and the Senator from Pennsylvania. 
If I may, let me just briefly respond to the statement made by my friend from Kentucky that there are not any interest groups supporting this amendment on the left or on the right. I am not surprised by that. Do you know who is supporting this amendment? The unorganized mass of the American people who do not belong to special interest groups of the left or the right and who know that something fundamentally wrong is happening in our democracy that is depriving them of their equal and individual right to affect their government. What is happening is the unlimited, and I am afraid corrupting, use of money in America politics. 
Mr. President, I do not come to supporting a constitutional amendment of any kind, certainly one affecting the first amendment, lightly. I do not believe that I have ever supported any other amendment to the Constitution that would alter the first amendment. But I think that the threat to our democracy from the excess of money in politics is so serious that it merits--in fact, it calls out for--support of this constitutional amendment. 
Let's remember what we are doing here when we talk about the Buckley decision. To pass this constitutional amendment is not to contradict what the Framers of the Constitution did in their great work more than 200 years ago. It is to contradict five of the Members of the U.S. Supreme Court, who gave a rendering of the first amendment that I cannot imagine the Framers of our Constitution had in mind, which is that money is speech. It is hard to believe. The consequences are serious. 
So it is only by supporting this amendment and giving us the right to limit the amount of money in politics that I think we can restore a sense of integrity and sanity to our campaign finance system and, if I do say so, to our democracy. 
Mr. President, much of the debate over this proposed constitutional amendment has centered on this question of the threat to the principle of free speech. Of course, we all hold that principle dear. But free speech is not what is at issue here. Free speech is about the inalienable God-given right of all of us to express our points of view without governmental interference. That simply is not at issue here in this proposed amendment, or in our campaign finance system. 
Mr. President, nothing in this amendment or in any campaign finance reform package that I have seen that could be passed here would diminish or threaten individual Americans' rights to express their views about candidates running for office, or about any problem or issue in American life. What would be threatened by this constitutional amendment is what should be threatened by it, and that is something entirely different--the ever-increasing and disproportionate power that those with money have over our political system. As everyone in this Chamber knows, the spiraling costs of running for office require all of us to spend more and more time raising money and more and more time with those who give it. 
Barely a day goes by in which we do not learn of an event or a meeting with elected officials attended only by those who could afford to give $5,000 or $10,000 or $100,000 or more--sums of money that are obviously beyond the capacity of the overwhelming majority of the American people. And that is threatening a principle all of us also hold dear, as dearly as the principle of free speech, which is the fundamental underlying principle of our democracy. It is a sacred principle. I say it is sacred because of that line in the beginning of the Declaration of Independence: All men are created equal and we, men and women of America, are endowed not by Congress, not by some committee but by our Creator with the inalienable right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. 
That principle guarantees that every person has one vote and each and every one of us, rich or poor or in between, has an equal right and an equal ability to influence the workings of our Government. As it stands now, it is that sacred principle, the underlying principle of all of the rights expressed in the Bill of Rights in the Constitution, that is under attack from our campaign finance status quo system, and that sacred principle that promises to remain under attack until we do something to save it and protect it, and that something, I submit, is quite simply to limit the influence of money in politics. I do not see a way to do that without limiting the amount of money spent in political campaigns, and I do not see a way to do that constitutionally without passing this constitutional amendment. 
Mr. President, nothing less than the future of our great democracy is at stake here. Unless we act to reform our campaign finance system, people with money will continue to have disproportionate influence in our system. People who are not even citizens of the United States will try to influence our Government's decision by their use of money. And the genius of America--that our citizenship based on our common creation by God, not our pocketbook, gives us each equal power to play a role in our governance--that genius will continue to be under seige. 
Mr. President, I support the constitutional amendment. I thank the Chair.

 Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, today I join my friend and colleague, Senator Domenici in cosponsoring a resolution to designate a week in October as `National Character Counts Week.' 
This will mark the fourth consecutive year that we have considered such a resolution to honor the Character Counts movement. It is small gesture, but a meaningful one all the same. By recognizing this program, Congress is making an important statement about both the value of character education and the state of our values. We are saying affirmatively that our public schools can and must play a central role in shaping the character and values of our children. And we are saying that this kind of commitment, a commitment to the principles undergirding the Character Counts Program, is needed now more than ever. 
The reality, Mr. President, is that the state of our values is not well. The American people are deeply concerned about the abundant evidence they see of a real moral breakdown in our society--so much so that polls taken over the last few years routinely show that the public is more worried about the country's moral decline than its economic decline. 
What's driving this concern, which many of us in this Chamber share, is an understanding that our growing inability to make moral distinctions, to draw lines about right and wrong and set boundaries about what is acceptable behavior, is having real consequences. We are recognizing that this moral breakdown is contributing to and exacerbating some of our society's most profound social ills, such as the rising tide of ever more random and vicious violence committed by ever more younger killers, the disintegration of the family, the crisis of teenage illegitimacy, the coarsening of our culture, and the loss of civility in our polity and our everyday lives. 
More and more these days there is a sense that our country is spiraling out of control, and at the root of that feeling is what might be called a values vacuum. The traditional transmitters of values that we have depended on for generations to build character and bind our moral safety net have lost much of their power. One of those transmitters is the family, which is under enormous economic pressure these days and is prey to divorce and other forms of breakdown. Another transmitter is the community and the loose connection of local civic institutions we refer to as civil society, which has weakened to the point that an entire movement has sprung up to renew it. 
Then there are our public schools. For generations the public school system was the backbone of our democracy, where children were not just taught what is good grammar but what it means to be a good citizen, and where children of all backgrounds were versed in a common set of core values. But in recent years public schools have increasingly lost that mission, and too often shied away from questions of values and the formation of character. In the eyes of many families, some schools might as well had signs out front declaring them value-neutral zones. 
What is perhaps most disturbing about this trend is that the values vacuum the schools have helped create is being filled more and more these days by the electronic media and the frequently destructive messages it is bombarding our children with. The collective force of television, movies, music, and video games is so influential that many parents I talk to feel as if they are in a competition with the culture to raise their children and give them strong values. The character traits they are trying to instill in their children are being openly contradicted by the bulk of the messages kids are receiving about the acceptability and the inconsequentiality of casual sex, the contempt for all forms of authority, and the appropriateness of settling a dispute by putting a bullet through the other person's temple. The result is the prevalence of what one leading expert on child development calls the culture of disrespect. 
The media's inability to make moral distinctions and draw lines about right and wrong makes it all the more important for us to strengthen our traditional values transmitters. And that is why the Character Counts movement deserves all the support we 
can provide. Rebuilding our families and our communities will be a long, painstaking process. But reviving the role of schools in helping our children learn about the fundamentals of character is a challenge we can meet easily and quickly. 
In fact, the Character Counts program has already done the hard part, identifying the core values and principles that we can all agree that we want our schools to instill and reinforce in our children. The question of whose values? that is often asked has been answered, with a consensus behind our values--trustworthiness, respect, responsibility, fairness, caring for others, and citizenship. 
I am heartened to know that the Character Counts program is rapidly spreading through communities across the country, and I am particularly proud that my State of Connecticut has made a long-term commitment to bring character education into every school district in the State. With the aid of a $250,000 grant from the U.S. Department of Education last year, the State took the first major step toward that goal by selecting four communities for funding to introduce the Character Counts Program on a districtwide basis. 
Some Connecticut schools have already embraced this program on their own, and I can report to my colleagues that it is bearing fruit. Let me offer one compelling example. Last year a nine-year-old from the town of Torrington named Joshua Dy found an envelope on the ground that contained three $100 bills. Joshua said he initially thought of keeping the money for himself, but he then thought of what he learned in Character Counts at the Southwest School and from his father about honesty and integrity, and decided the right thing would be to turn the money over to the police. Joshua was rewarded for his honesty when the police returned the money to him after no one claimed it and when President Clinton saluted his good character with a letter of congratulations. 
Mr. President, I would encourage my colleagues to find their own ways to reward and recognize the good deeds that are germinating from the seeds of Character Counts. A good place to start is with this resolution, which will help raise public awareness of this valuable values program and make Character Counts really count. Let me close by praising Senator Domenici for his leadership on this issue, and by asking that my remarks be placed in the appropriate place in the Record to accompany the Character Counts resolution.

 Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, from the time I came to the Senate in 1989, I have been proud to advocate enterprise zones for America's troubled neighborhoods. I think this issue is at the heart of the whole question of what America must do to redeem the promise of economic opportunity for all Americans. I was pleased to work with Jack Kemp on this issue when he was Secretary of HUD, for the past 2 years with Senator Abraham, and now with Representatives Watts, Flake, and Talent. 
We all believe that not enough is being done to empower those people who live, work, and want to start businesses in our poorest urban and rural areas of the country. Any response to the economic distress in urban and rural areas which does not include a mechanism to attract businesses and jobs back to these areas is a response that is destined to fail. 
We took a step toward empowering poor Americans and identifying and helping impoverished communities by passing 1993 legislation creating empowerment zones and enterprise communities in more than 100 neighborhoods across the country. With the passage of that legislation, Congress recognized something that our States have acknowledged for many years: Government loses the war on poverty when it fights alone. What we really need to do is figure out a way to pull the people and the places with little or no stake in our economic system, into our system. We need to answer `yes' to the question posed by Paul Pryde, coauthor of `Black Entrepreneurship in America.' That question is, `Can we make the market work for the discouraged, isolated and frequently embittered underclass?' 
We can, and need, to answer, `yes.' The 1993 legislation marked a fundamental change in urban policy, by recognizing that American business can and must play a role in revitalizing poor neighborhoods. Indeed, American business involvement is essential if we are to break the cycle of poverty and the related ills confronting too many cities and rural areas today--crime, drug abuse, illiteracy, and unemployment. 
The 1993 breakthrough was a good start, but we did not go far enough. That's why I am pleased to join with my colleague, Senator Spencer Abraham, on a bipartisan basis, in announcing the American Community Renewal Act of 1997. We want to help economically distressed urban and rural areas by creating 100 community renewal zones, including current empowerment zones and enterprise communities created by OBRA 1993, and additional communities meeting poverty and local commitment criteria. Specifically, these zones must have a 20 percent or more poverty rate, unemployment of at least 15 percent the national rate, and at least 70 percent of households with incomes below 80 percent median household income. Renewal communities will commit to reducing barriers to business, such as reductions in local taxes and fees, elimination of State and local sales tax, and waiver of local and State occupational licensing regulations except for those specifically needed to protect health and safety. 
This legislation will offer targeted, pro-growth tax and regulatory relief to encourage private sector job creation and economic activity in impoverished areas. To enhance business and community partnerships, we have included provisions to facilitate additional housing opportunities, encourage savings, and offer additional education and investment opportunities. The CRA credit will facilitate additional investment and lending to community development financial institutions, and family development accounts will encourage low-income families to save part of their income or EITC refund. Family development account funds will be deductible for tax purposes and can be withdrawn tax-free if used for qualified purposes. Family and community ties will be strengthened through new private investment opportunities and expanded access to drug treatment in these communities. 
We cannot give up on our inner cities and impoverished areas. Government, itself, cannot revitalize these areas. Communities must be strengthened through expanded economic opportunities, jobs, and private sector development in people's own local neighborhoods. Only then, can our communities save themselves from the vicious cycle of poverty and prepare our children for the future. Local partnerships and the commitment of business and communities to improving the economy of our poorest areas will provide the cornerstone of the future. 
Through limited government involvement, enhanced personal responsibility, and the economic freedom of business to grow and develop, poor communities can become players in our Nation's economy. The American Community Renewal Act helps poor Americans of all backgrounds pursue happiness, and escape from the trap of poverty that defines too many of their lives today.

 Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to honor Diversified Intergenerational Care, Inc., in recognition of the grand opening of their facility at the West Haven Medical Center on March 21, 1997. This facility, which is the first of its kind in the Nation, will provide child care services and care for the mildly ill and elderly. 
The sole principals of the company, Scott L. Shafer and Bernard L. Ginsberg, were able to make this facility a reality through a lease they were awarded by the Department of Veterans Affairs. They were selected for the Department's enhanced-use lease through a highly competitive process involving companies nationwide. 
Diversified Intergenerational Care, Inc., considers it an honor to work with the Department of Veterans Affairs. They intend to continue their partnership by developing other inter-generational facilities. Their goal is to satisfy the unmet need for child care services while also providing care for mildly ill children and the elderly at VA medical centers across the country. 
I congratulate Diversified Inter-generational Care, Inc., the Department of Veterans Affairs in Washington, DC, and the Connecticut Healthcare System for creating this very worthwhile facility, and thank them for working to make these vital services available to those in need.

Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to support the Senate's wise decision to amend the scope provision of Senate Resolution 39, the funding resolution for the Governmental Affairs Committee investigation into campaign finance. I had planned to offer this afternoon an amendment virtually identical to what the Senate has now adopted. This amendment addresses what most deeply troubled me about that resolution: the restriction in the version that came to the Senate floor of the scope of the investigation that previously every member of the Governmental Affairs Committee unanimously agreed to. Each and every member of our committee--Republican and Democrat alike--had voted to authorize an investigation into both illegal and improper campaign finance activities. Unfortunately, before our funding resolution got to the floor it had been modified in the rules committee to preclude the Governmental Affairs Committee from exercising authority to look into `improper' activities, arguing that it was enough for us to look into only `illegal' activities. 
Mr. President, I applaud the bipartisan decision to reverse that decision and to return the term `improper' to the scope of the Governmental Affairs Committee's investigation. Without the return of that authority, I was concerned that our committee's hopes of conducting a thorough and bipartisan investigation would have been dashed. We would have been forced to conduct an investigation that I feared would have failed to expose the ills of our campaign finance system and would have further undermined the public's confidence in the working of our political institutions. 
The continuing revelations about the state of our campaign finance system may not only shake the American people's confidence in the integrity of our political system, but our own confidence and self-respect. It is therefore our obligation in Congress to conduct a thorough investigation into the cause and scope of those problems, into the extent of any illegal and improper activities that occurred, and then, on the basis of those inquiries, to decide what action Congress must take to prevent these things from ever happening again and what activities should be illegal. For that reason, and like each and every one of my colleagues on the Governmental Affairs Committee--Republican and Democrat alike--I voted to conduct a broad-based inquiry into the problems that have plagued our campaign finance system. In a unified and strong voice, our Committee declared an intention to explore and expose all improper activities taken during recent Federal campaigns. If there were illegal activities taken by anyone, we declared--whether they be in the White House, in the 
national parties or in the Congress--we planned to investigate them. If there were activities taken that some would call illegal, but because of a technicality in the law, may not be--still, we declared, we want to investigate them. And, if there were activities taken that clearly were not illegal, but just as clearly were improper and so threatened to undermine the integrity of our political system, we declared, then we must be able to investigate those too, so that we could decide what behavior is now legal that we want to make illegal. That is what we mean by campaign finance reform. On January 30, 1997, I joined all of my colleagues on the Governmental Affairs Committee--Republicans and Democrats alike--in voting to authorize an investigation that would do all of those things. 
Unfortunately, some disagreed with the Governmental Affairs Committee's desire to expose all improprieties in our campaign finance system, not just acts that are illegal. In what I have been told is an unprecedented action, there was an effort to deny the Governmental Affairs Committee this jurisdiction. 
Accepting that vote and limiting the scope of the Governmental Affairs Committee's investigation to merely `illegal' activities would have limited us in investigating what most people agree is wrong with the system; it would have damaged our ability to obtain evidence and subpoena witnesses; and it ultimately may have led to a partisan breakdown on the Governmental Affairs Committee over the meaning of the term `illegal.' The net effect clearly would have been to make it less likely for Congress to adopt campaign finance reform this session. 
Let me give just a couple of examples of how this restricted scope would have caused problems for the Governmental Affairs Committee investigation. Most people seem to agree that our committee should look into the influence of so-called foreign money. Those supporting the limitation of our investigatory scope to illegal activities argue that that limitation has no impact on our ability to investigate foreign money. And, it is true that we have a statute, section 441e of title 2 of the United States Code that makes it--and I quote--`unlawful for a foreign national * * * to make any contribution * * * in connection with an election to any political office * * * or for any person to solicit, accept, or receive any such contribution from a foreign national.' This provision has been cited for the proposition that any and all contributions by non-U.S. citizens or greencard holders to political parties is a criminal offense. 
But as is often true with the law, not everything is as it seems. Instead, under the election law's own definition of the term `contribution' and the Supreme Court's previous interpretations of election law terms similar to `in connection with an election,'--provisions, I might add, that those seeking to limit our investigation seem not to want to change--under those laws it is highly likely that the Court would find 
that section 441e does not criminalize so-called soft money contributions to national parties by foreigners. Let me say that again: soft money donations from non-U.S. citizens likely are not `illegal.' That is because under the way our campaign laws now are drafted, soft money contributions are, by definition, not made in connection with an election, and only contributions made in connection with an election are illegal. Instead, `soft money' contributions go to fund party building and grassroots activities, as well as to help pursue issues advocacy, and apparently no statute says that foreign money cannot go to that. In fact, it is a similar statutory term that allows corporations and unions to give millions of dollars to the national parties, despite the fact that our Federal election laws make it illegal for those entities to make contributions in connection with elections for Federal office. 
In short, under a strict reading of the statute, if foreign money goes for issues advocacy or for grassroots activity or for practically anything else but to fund a particular candidate's direct campaign, it is likely not illegal, and therefore the Governmental Affairs Committee, absent this amendment, would not have been able to investigate it. 
Now I know that some will say that I am splitting legal hairs, and I would agree with you. It is splitting legal hairs. But, as a former State Attorney General, I can tell you that the splitting of legal hairs is precisely what often goes into making a determination of what is legal and what is illegal. For as long as our Bill of Rights has been in place, the enforcement of our laws--and particularly of our criminal laws--has not rested on what we think a criminal statute should have said or what we wish it did say. Instead, it rests with what Congress actually did say, regardless of whether you or I in hindsight wish we had said something different. And the reason for this is a very good one. Our Constitution requires that everyone of us have clear notice of what is and is not legal, and consequently requires us in Congress to say in precise and clear terms what is criminal and what is not. Whenever there is any doubt about whether a statute makes conduct criminal or not, the Supreme Court has told us on innumerable occasions, the law requires a finding against criminality. And I can say with confidence that that is precisely the finding our courts would make if asked whether foreign contributions for issues advocacy and grassroots activities violate our laws. So again, we would not have been able to investigate a critically important issue. 
Let me give you another example of what would not have been within our investigation's scope had we not expanded it to cover improper as well as illegal activities. There has been a lot of criticism about soliciting or receiving contributions in the White House. Some have claimed that there was a violation of the criminal law based on a statute that says that `it shall be unlawful for any person to solicit or 
receive any contribution within the meaning of section 301(8) of the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 in any room or building occupied in the discharge of official duties * * *.' But, as Attorney General Reno declared the other day, and for reasons similar to the ones I just cited, that provision does not make it unlawful to receive all contributions in the White House. Instead, it only applies to what the campaign laws define as a contribution--what we usually call `hard money.' 
This, of course, does not mean that it is proper for anyone to solicit or receive any contributions in the White House. And, even more importantly, it clearly does not mean that foreigners should be able to contribute to the DNC or the RNC--I think that neither is proper and that we need to fully investigate whether our elections were in any way wrongly influenced by people who have no business being involved in our political system. What it does, of course, mean is that we need to reflect upon the fact that our laws don't make these things illegal and to change our laws to make sure it doesn't happen again. 
Now, none of this matters so long as the Governmental Affairs Committee can investigate both illegal and improper activities, because I can tell you for sure that foreign contributions--regardless of their legality--are improper and should be investigated and exposed. But had we not amended the Rules Committee's scope provision, we likely would not have been able to investigate these things because they are not illegal. 
The problems with limiting our committee's scope to just illegal activities would not have ended with being forced to exclude critical issues from our investigation. No--there were many more problems with this definition of our scope. For one, it would have seriously jeopardized our committee's ability to obtain evidence and get witnesses to testify, and it therefore would have threatened the very ability of our committee to proceed with its investigation. After all, our committee has authority to subpoena only those documents that are related to the legitimate scope of its inquiry. If the scope of our committee's investigation were limited to illegal activities alone, then I would suggest that any attorney representing a client whose documents have been subpoenaed would have responded by saying `my client did nothing illegal and therefore you have no rights to these documents.' Our investigation would have been stopped dead in its tracks right there. 
In sum, it would have been wrong on every level to limit our investigation to just illegal activities. It would have prevented us from investigating things that should be investigated, it would have led us to prolonged battles with witnesses who otherwise would be obliged to come forward and cooperate and it would have made it likely that the partisan rift we have thus far been seeing on the committee would grow 
wider rather than undergo the seriously needed repair we began making today. But the worst of it could have been the harm our institution will suffer in the minds of the public. Had we not expanded the scope of this investigation, the U.S. Senate would have gone on record, in full public view, opposing the investigation of unethical and improper campaign activities of Members of Congress. If that would not have been perceived as a stonewall and a coverup, I don't know what would be. 
Finally, let me say just a few words about one other issue: That the Rules Committee could have separately investigated the improprieties I wish to see exposed by our committee. With all due respect to the members of the Rules Committee, for whom I have tremendous respect, that simply is not a viable--or a rational--option. As the examples I gave above demonstrate, although some of what is now under scrutiny may be illegal, most of it probably is just improper. The task of investigating the massive universe of improper activities is therefore an enormous one, as is deciding what should be illegal. In light of the facts that many of the same people will have committed both improper and illegal activities and that much of the conduct under investigation arguably would fall into both categories, it just would not have made sense for the Rules Committee to conduct an investigation that will, in many ways, duplicate what our committee will be doing. In fact, it was this precise insight--that it did not make sense from a resource allocation standpoint to spend taxpayer funds on duplicative investigations--that led the majority at the beginning of this Congress to wisely decide to consolidate all investigations in the Governmental Affairs Committee. 
Mr. President, let me just close with a few thoughts on what the goal of this investigation should be. We're about to enter a long, dark tunnel, and the question of whether that tunnel has a dead end, or there is light at the other end, hinges entirely on whether we get serious about this campaign finance investigation and about campaign finance reform. The public didn't send us here to bicker; that's essentially what President's Bush and Clinton had to say in their inaugural addresses. They also didn't send us here to dicker endlessly, especially on matters of importance to them like investigating and straightening out our campaign finance laws. I hope that the showing of bipartisanship we made today in agreeing to return a broader scope to the Governmental Affairs Committee's investigation can continue through the rest of our investigation and, I hope just as strongly, can bring us together to enact the reforms that our campaign finance system so sorely needs.

Mr. LIEBERMAN. Perhaps, in the spirit of bipartisanship that is on the floor now, if I use the remaining 4 minutes of Senator Glenn's time, I may turn to Senator Thompson and ask him to yield a few. 
Mr. President, I want to thank everyone involved in what occurred here today. This is an extraordinarily significant accomplishment, not only on its face but in what it says about the willingness of the U.S. Senate to deal directly with the problem of too much money in American politics to deign to do something about it. 
This is a significant victory which is attributable in large measure to the leadership of the Senate, the majority leader, Democratic leader, and the leadership of the committee, the Senator from Tennessee, the chairman, and the Senator from Ohio. But it is, in truth, as has been said on other occasions, not a victory for any person or any party, it is truly a victory for the public interest. 
Mr. President, over the last couple of weeks there was a strange and troubling discontinuity between the growing avalanche of revelations about the impact of money on American politics and the impression it gives that American democracy is for sale, on the one hand, and the seeming movement here in the Senate, particularly in the vote in the Rules Committee last week. I am not saying this was the intention, but it certainly gave the impression of going into a kind of bunker of not being willing to have a full and open investigation of the problem of the way in which campaigns are financed in this country. By limiting the jurisdiction of the investigation to be performed by the Governmental Affairs Committee to illegal activities in association with the 1996 Federal elections, the impact would have been effectively to have crippled the investigation, in my opinion. 
Who would have decided what was illegal? Could not anyone subpoenaed by the committee have claimed that their client had not done anything illegal, and therefore the subpoena was improper? 
Of course, the basic purpose here, if we are serious about campaign finance reform, should be to investigate and reveal and inform, as the chairman of the committee said in one of his opening statements in this investigation, to inform the public about what is legal today but ought to be illegal, what is improper or unclear but ought to be illegal. That is what campaign finance reform is all about, taking some of the vagaries of the current system, some things that are not vague but are clearly improper, not illegal, and making them illegal. 
And as disappointing as the vote of the Rules Committee was last Thursday, I believe the vote of the Senate today, bipartisan as it is, is heartening. Reason has prevailed. I think Members of the Senate on both sides of the aisle focused in on the impact of this constricting jurisdiction for the investigative committee and decided it was not right. And that resulted in the addition of these simple two words, `or improper.' But there is a world of difference in those. 
A significant step forward has been taken today on the road to campaign finance reform. What is most important is that we have done it together, Republicans and Democrats, acting not as Republicans and Democrats, but as Americans facing a very serious challenge to our democracy. 
Mr. President, I wonder if I might ask the Senator from Tennessee if he would yield me 2 minutes of his time?

Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the chairman. 
Mr. President, this is serious business. There are some people, I think, who rightly say the American people do not really care about all this campaign finance trouble, maybe because they are numb to these kinds of revelations. Some say maybe, `Oh, they all think it goes on anyways, so what's the difference. Everybody does it.' 
I do not know whether the American people are listening or watching. I believe they really are. But I know that history is watching. And I know that we will be judged as to how we respond to this fundamental challenge to our democracy: the basic premise of equal access to Government, the basic premise of a Government in which one person has one vote and one person who may have a lot of money to put in politics does not have any more influence than that one person with one vote. 
But when people can walk in and give hundreds of thousands of dollars, and money moves from committees to committees, when people in politics, as we know because we are there, have to spend as much time as they do and feel the relentless pressure that they do to meet the competition, to raise the money to pay for the advertisements, then the standards of each one of us are tested and the standards of the system are challenged. 
A lot has been made in this debate and in the media about allegations that foreign countries or interests may have attempted to purchase influence, used campaign contributions. Mr. President, I will tell you that that is despicable behavior. But what we have to say to our ourselves is, they have done so because they believe, apparently, if these allegations are right, that American democracy is for sale. None of us want to leave that impression. And the way to correct it is by reforming our campaign finance laws. The way to begin that process is to do the kind of full and open investigation that the Senate, by this amendment, will now authorize. I have great confidence in the chairman of the committee.

 Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, the State of Connecticut, sports fans, and alumni of Yale University said goodbye to a true national coaching legend when Carm Cozza stepped down as coach of the Yale University football team last fall. 
Carm was Yale's head coach for 32 years, winning a school-record 179 games and coaching 1,300 players. He led the Elis to 10 Ivy League championships and coached future National Football League stars like Calvin Hill, who went on to win a championship with the Dallas Cowboys in the 1970's and Gary Fencik, a member of the Super Bowl XX champion Chicago Bears. He is a Connecticut and American coaching icon. 
`I think Cozza epitomizes the champion that all of us try to be, that we strive to be,' said Fencik, an All-American in 1975, in a recent interview with the New Haven Register. 
`You learn a lot more about a man under adversity and Carm had tremendous adversity that first year. My first year we didn't even have a winning record and he treated that season the same as the next two when we won league titles,' said Hill in the same story. 
Cozza began his coaching career at Yale at a time when Ivy League football was truly top-notch college football. But as the prestige of Ivy League football faded, and Division I-AA football slipped in general, Carm stayed at Yale. He was offered jobs at the University of Virginia and Princeton, but elected to stay in Connecticut. And we're grateful for that, because he's touched the lives of so many Ivy League athletes and so many other people in our State. A true testament of how successful Cozza's former players have become is in the numbers--Seven NCAA post-graduate scholarship winners, seven GTE /CoSIDA District I academic All-Americans, five National Football Foundation Hall of Fame Scholar-Athletes, and five Rhodes Scholars. These numbers make Cozza the proudest and the best of leaders. 
His coaches have also gone on to bigger and better positions. Eleven of his assistant coaches became head coaches on the college level. Included on the list are Buddy Amendola, who led Central Connecticut State University, Jim Root--William & Mary--Bill Mallory--Indiana--Bill Narduzzi--Youngstown State. 
Cozza's football coaching career commenced at the high school level at Gilmour Academy and Collinwood High, both in Ohio, before he became the head freshman coach at Miami in 1956. Five seasons later, he joined the varsity as an assistant. He left Miami in 1963 to join John Pont's staff at Yale and after Pont resigned to become head coach at Indiana, Cozza became the Bulldogs' new head coach. 
The lives he touched--let's just say they all remember. They all are grateful. At a farewell dinner last fall, all but one of his captains came back to pay tribute. The only one who didn't appear was on business and couldn't get away. Each shared a story about him. 
Sending written tributes, congratulating the coach on an incredible career, were President Clinton and former Presidents Bush and Ford. Gov. John Rowland proclaimed the day he coached his final game Carm Cozza Day and New Haven Mayor John DeStefano did the same for the city. 
Carmen Louis Cozza was born on June 10, 1930, in Parma, OH. He earned 11 varsity letters in football, basketball, track, and baseball, while serving as class president his last 3 years, at Parma High and was inducted into the school's Hall of Fame in 1982. Cozza and his wife, the former Jean Annable, reside in Orange, not far from his beloved Yale. 
We'll all miss this living legend's presence on the football field. But his presence in our hearts and the memories of his great career will live on.

 Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to honor Diversified Intergenerational Care, Inc., in recognition of the grand opening of their facility at the West Haven Medical Center on March 21, 1997. This facility, which is the first of its kind in the Nation, will provide child care services and care for the mentally ill and elderly. 
The sole principals of the company, Scott L. Shafer and Bernard L. Ginsberg, were able to make this facility a reality through a lease they were awarded by the Department of Veterans Affairs. They were selected for the Department's enhanced-use lease through a highly competitive process involving companies nationwide. 
Diversified Intergenerational Care, Inc. considers it an honor to work with the Department of Veterans Affairs. They intend to continue their partnership by developing other intergenerational facilities. Their goal is to satisfy the unmet need for care for children, the elderly, and the mentally ill at VA medical centers across the country. 
I congratulate Diversified Intergenerational Care, Inc. and the Department of Veterans Affairs for creating this very worthwhile facility, and thank them for working to make these vital services available to those in need.

Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Chair. Mr. President, I rise this morning to discuss the status of the President's nomination of Anthony Lake--Tony Lake--to be the Director of Central Intelligence. 
Mr. President, I read from the New York Times this morning, which reports in its lead story, `Leaders in the Senate demand FBI files on CIA nominee.' I quote from the lead paragraph: 
Chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee said today that unless he received all of the FBI files on Anthony Lake, he would not hold confirmation hearings for Mr. Lake. 
Later, in that same story, the author says: 
It is reported that two senior Republican members of the committee, Senators Lugar and Chafee, said today they would probably vote for Mr. Lake, barring some devastating disclosure at the confirmation hearings. 
Senator Lugar, our distinguished colleague and friend from Indiana, says that he strongly disagrees with the demand for the opening of these files and the delay of the hearing. According to Senator Lugar, `The whole confirmation process becomes more and more outrageous. People feel it is their duty to engage in character assassination or to cause the nominee's defeat, or to discourage and demoralize them. The FBI files are raw files,' Mr. Lugar said. `They may contain rumor, gossip, hearsay, or innuendo. They may be true, they may be false, they may be scandalously defamatory, but they should not be the basis of evaluating someone's character.' 
Mr. President, I come to the floor to appeal to the leadership of the Intelligence Committee to move forward with the hearing on March 11 and to treat this nominee fairly, because the process is becoming unfair. Every time a hurdle is erected for Mr. Lake and he jumps over it, another one seems to be erected in its place. Continuing with the sports analogy, every time Tony Lake moves the ball toward the goal line, the goal line is pushed back. And the process is beginning to look more like a fishing expedition than like a process of congressional evaluation of a Presidential nominee--one who has served his country with distinction over the course of many years--that is fair and proceeding expeditiously and with a sense of due process. 
Mr. President, in speaking about Tony Lake's nomination, I think it is important that I share my belief of what our role is when we advise and consent here in this Senate to nominations of the President. I faced this question early in my time here, in 1989, on several occasions regarding the nominations of President Bush. I supported almost all of them. It seemed to me then, as it does now, that our role here is not to substitute ourselves for the President. The President is elected to make these nominations. I decided that the standard I would impose is not whether I would have nominated this individual. That is what Presidents are elected for. The Senate's role is to advise and consent. I think that means the standard we should follow is to determine whether the President's nominee is within the acceptable range for the particular job for which that person is nominated, not whether we would have nominated that person. 
Mr. President, on that standard, it seems to me that Tony Lake more than meets the qualifications for being a superb Director of Central Intelligence at a very, very critical time for the intelligence community in the history of our Nation. 
As I indicated a few moments ago, Mr. Lake has served our country in various capacities with great honor over many years. He has been a student of government and a teacher of government in universities, and returned to government again to serve for the last 4 years with dignity and, I think, great effect as the National Security Adviser. 
What standards do we hold up for this particular nomination? I am pleased to be able to find a good source to rely on. That is an article written by Robert Gates, CIA Director under President Bush, published in the Wall Street Journal on January 29 of this year. Bob Gates held up three standards for judging a nominee for Director of Central Intelligence. 
No. 1, is that person recognized as a man of integrity and principle, a man prepared to stand up for what he believes is right? 
No. 2, is that person knowledgeable about foreign affairs? 
No. 3, does that person have the confidence of the President and know well the rest of the President's national security team? 
On all three counts, Bob Gates, a distinguished public servant with an excellent record of service to our country, found Tony Lake qualified with a lot to spare. 
I quote from that article in the Wall Street Journal. First, Bob Gates says, Tony Lake is `broadly recognized as a man of integrity and principle, and as a man with courage to stand up for what he believes is right. This offers reassurance that he will be 
independent of the White House in which he served and will be directed by a moral grounding most Americans would find admirable.' 
It is hard to convey this in a few moments on the floor. But I have known Tony Lake for a number of years. And I do not agree with everything he has ever done in his career. But, believe me, this is a person who has always been animated by a desire to do the right thing for his country. And that is why Bob Gates says accurately that Tony Lake `* * * will be directed by a moral grounding most Americans would find admirable.' 
Second, whether or not one agrees with him on the issues, he is thoroughly knowledgeable about foreign affairs. That is self-evident based on the enormously successful record he has made over the last 4 years sitting at the center of America's foreign policy during a difficult time, and one in which I think most observers agree has seen America remain strong and recognized as not only the one superpower in the world but a superpower that has used its power effectively and ethically and morally. 
Third, does he have the confidence of the President? I suppose that is self-evident since the President appointed him. He does. And, of course, he knows the rest of the people that comprise the national security team in this administration. That is important, not just for matters of friendship, but because the intelligence functions should be at the heart of our foreign policy. Because of the personal relations Tony Lake has with the President, the Vice President and others in a foreign policy apparatus of this Government, he will bring intelligence to the center of their deliberations, where it clearly belongs. 
I have said that in this process of evaluating Tony Lake's nomination, at every point where a hurdle was established he jumped over it, and then more hurdles were erected. Some of these questions have been fair. The questions about how he handled stock holdings were examined by the appropriate oversight bodies and he was cleared. And I have some personal knowledge on questions about how he handled the shipment of arms from Islamic countries through Croatia to Bosnia because, along with the former majority leader, Senator Dole, and other distinguished colleagues here, I worked for a long time to lift the arms embargo against the Bosnians. 
The question was, did Tony Lake do anything in response to messages from our Ambassador to Croatia indicating that the Croatians were wondering how we would react to shipments of arms across this country to Bosnia? Tony Lake responded that there were no instructions. Some critics have seemed to suggest that there was a point in these deliberations where, although Tony Lake clearly said there were no instructions, somehow his body language conveyed a different message. Now, if we are getting to the point where we are beginning to question the capacity of people to be Directors of Central Intelligence because of their body language, we are heading down a very unusual road. 
I think questions about this incident have been well handled. Not only was the no-instructions policy not covert, but it was not an action within the meaning of relevant statute. And, in my personal opinion, because our European allies were taking a position against lifting the arms embargo and letting these poor Bosnians defend themselves, I think Tony Lake's decision to give no instructions successfully resolved a very difficult situation and was the absolutely moral decision to make. 
OK, so he jumped those two hurdles. But now, as the process goes on, it seems that every accusation made against the White House, that every question of criticism about foreign policy, is being put on his desk. He is being held up to a standard that is impossible to meet and fundamentally unfair. One day, somebody says, we will have to ask him questions about the administration's policy on Haiti. Another says that we have to check to make sure he had no involvement in any of the political fundraising going on in the White House. He seems to have kept himself very, very far from all of that. 
Now, there is the question of the FBI report. Knowing Tony Lake as I do, knowing his desire to cooperate with this Congress, I agree with Senator Robert Kerrey, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, when he says in the newspaper today that Tony will try to work out some agreement by which the members of the Intelligence Committee can see the FBI report. In some substantial sense, I regret that. Senator Kerrey has seen the report in full. I asked him for his judgment. I trust him totally. He said that there was nothing he saw in that report which would alter his decision to enthusiastically support Tony Lake's nomination. 
So I appeal to the leadership of the Senate Intelligence Committee. The Senator from Alabama, the chairman, is a good friend and an honorable, standup individual. 
I understand that some people may oppose this nomination, but, please, go ahead with that hearing on March 11. Let the man have his day. Ask him the tough questions. Then let the matter go to a vote in that committee. Bring it out to the floor. We can debate it out here. Let us vote on it. But let us not subject this fine man, this great public servant, this patriot to a kind of water torture where we keep dripping water on his head and do not treat him with the respect and dignity that he and the agency that he is nominated here by the President of the United States to lead both deserve. 
Mr. President, Senator John McCain, distinguished colleague and friend from Arizona, usually a pretty good guide to what is right around here--I say usually because he has a few gaps in logic with regard to the submarine construction program, but I leave those aside for now--sent a letter to all of us on January 29 in which he said:  
I support the nomination of Tony Lake to be the next Director of Central Intelligence and will introduce him to the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence when it holds hearings on this issue. I have worked frequently with Tony Lake over the years, and I agree with Bob Gates-- 
Referring to the earlier article I mentioned-- that he is a knowledgeable man of principle and integrity who can be expected to work well with other members of the President's national security team and with Congress. 
End of the quote from the Senator from Arizona, the Honorable John McCain. 
Mr. President, let me just add this one word about the intelligence community. I just do not think it is in the interest of the intelligence community or the country to permit Tony Lake's nomination to be unfairly delayed or to get mired in partisan politics. This nomination should be judged on its merits. That is all the nominee, that is all the Commander in Chief, that is all any of us who support him are asking. Delay and political warfare risks doing serious damage not only to Tony Lake's honor and good name but also to an agency that has traditionally enjoyed and still fundamentally and seriously deserves bipartisan support. The CIA and the intelligence community are at a crossroads. They need a principled and strong leader now, and that man is Tony Lake. 
Mr. President, at the end of the column he wrote for the Wall Street Journal, Bob Gates summed it up very well, and I quote finally from that article. Bob Gates says:  
As the last CIA Director, nominated by a Republican President and confirmed by a Democratic controlled Senate, I strongly believe that hard questions should be asked of Mr. Lake and then he should be confirmed expeditiously with broad bipartisan support. This would be in the best interests of the country and of the intelligence community. 
I thank the Chair and I yield the floor. 
Mr. BYRD addressed the Chair.

Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I am introducing today, together with Senator McCain and a number of other Senators from both sides of the aisle, the Biomaterials Access Assurance Act of 1997. This bipartisan bill responds to a looming crisis affecting more than 7 million patients annually who rely on implantable life-saving or life-enhancing medical devices such as pacemakers, heart valves, artificial blood vessels, hydrocephalic shunts, and hip and knee joints. These patients are at risk of losing access to the devices on which their lives and well-being depend because, as a result of actual and potential skyrocketing legal costs, the companies that supply the raw materials without which those devices cannot be made are simply refusing to sell their raw materials to device manufacturers. If we do not act soon, makers of the life-saving medical devices that we take for granted today may no longer able to buy the raw materials and components necessary to produce their products, and the public health may be seriously jeopardized. By taking the small step Senator McCain and I propose today, millions of Americans will no longer have to worry about losing access to the life-saving medical devices on which they depend. 
The reason for this impending crisis is an all too common one: an out-of-control product liability system. During hearings I held in 1994, as chairman of the Subcommittee on Regulation and Government Information, and again during hearings held by the Commerce Committee last Congress, we heard the same story from witness after witness. They all explained that the current legal system makes it too easy to bring lawsuits against raw materials suppliers and too expensive for those suppliers to defend themselves--even when the suppliers are not at fault and end up winning, as they virtually always do. According to one study, only three out of hundreds of liability cases brought against a raw material supplier led to a finding of wrongdoing against the supplier. Nevertheless, in all of those cases, the suppliers had to spend enormous amounts of money to defend themselves--often much more than the supplier ever profited from its sale of the raw materials. Many suppliers consequently have made the entirely rational decision that the costs of defending these lawsuits are just too high to justify selling raw materials to the makers of implantable medical devices. In short, for those suppliers, it just isn't worth it. 
How could this happen? A study by Aranoff Associates paints a clear, but dismal, picture. That study surveyed the markets for polyester yarn, resins such as DuPont's Teflon, and polyacetal resin such as DuPont's Delrin. The study showed that sales of these raw materials for use in manufacturing implantable medical devices was just a tiny percentage of the overall market--$606,000 out of total sales of over $11 billion, or just 0.006 percent. In return for that extra $606,000 in total annual sales, however, that raw material supplier, like others, faced potentially huge liability related costs, even if they never lost a lawsuit. 
To take one example, a company named Vitek manufactured an estimated 26,000 jaw implants using about 5-cents worth of DuPont Teflon in each device. The device was developed, designed, and marketed by Vitek, which was not related to DuPont. When those implants failed, Vitek declared bankruptcy, its founder fled to Switzerland, and the patients sued DuPont. DuPont has won virtually all these cases, but the cost has been staggering. The study estimated that DuPont spent at least $8 million per year over 6 years to defend these suits. To put this into perspective, DuPont's estimated legal expenses in these cases for just 1 year would have bought over a 13-year supply of DuPont's Dacron polyester, Teflon, and Delrin for all U.S. makers of implantable medical devices, not just makers of jaw implants. Faced with this overwhelming liability, DuPont decided to stop selling its products to manufacturers of permanently implanted medical devices. 
One supplier's decision alone might not be troublesome, but it is not just one supplier that has reached that decision. When I rose during the debate over the product liability bill last year, I put in the record the names of twelve suppliers who had withdrawn from the biomaterials market. Since then, I have learned that at least two more suppliers have done the same. There is no reason to believe that the economics will be different for other suppliers around the world. One of the witnesses at our 1994 hearing testified that she contacted 15 alternate suppliers of polyester yarn worldwide. All were interested in selling her raw materials--except for use in products made and used in the United States. By itself, this is a powerful statement about the nature of our American product liability laws, and it makes a powerful case for reform. 
What's at stake here, let me be clear, is not protecting suppliers from liability and not even just making raw materials available to the manufacturers of medical devices. What's at stake is the health of millions of Americans who depend on medical devices for their everyday survival. What's at stake is the health of children like Thomas Reilly from Houston, TX, who suffers from hydrocephalus, a condition in which fluid accumulates around the brain. A special shunt enables him to survive. But continued production of that shunt is in doubt because the raw materials' suppliers are concerned about the potential lawsuit costs. At our hearing in 1994, Thomas' father, Mark Reilly, pleaded for Congress to move forward quickly to assure that the supply of those shunts will continue. 
What's at stake is the health of adults like Peggy Phillips of Falls Church, VA, whose heart had twice stopped beating because of fibrillation. Today, she lives an active, normal life because she has an implanted automatic defibrillator. Again, critical components of the defibrillator may no longer be available because of potential product liability costs. Ms. Phillips urged Congress to move swiftly to enact legislation protecting raw materials and component part suppliers from product liability. 
The scope of this problem affects young and old alike. Take a pacemaker. Pacemakers are 
installed in patients whose hearts no longer generate enough of an electrical pulse to get the heart to beat. To keep the heart beating, a pacemaker is connected to the heart with wires. These wires have silicone rubber insulation. Unfortunately, the suppliers of the rubber have begun to withdraw from the market. With this pacemaker, thousands of Americans can live productive and healthy lives for decades. 
Take another example, a heart valve. Around the edge of a heart valve is a sleeve of polyester fabric. This fabric is what the surgeon sews through when he or she installs this valve. Without that sleeve, it would be difficult, if not impossible, to install the valve. Without that valve, patients die prematurely. 
In short, this developing product liability crisis will have widespread and serious effects. We cannot simply allow the over 7 million people who owe their health to medical devices to become casualties of an outmoded legal liability system. Because product liability litigation costs make the economics of supplying raw materials to the implantable medical device makers very unfavorable, it is imperative that we act now. We cannot rationally expect raw materials suppliers to continue to serve the medical device market out of the goodness of their hearts, notwithstanding the liability related costs. We need to reform our product liability laws, to give raw material suppliers some assurance that unless there is real evidence that they were responsible for putting a defective device on the market, they cannot be sued simply in the hope that their deep pockets will fund legal settlements. 
I have long believed that liability reform could be both proconsumer and probusiness. I believe the testimony we heard on this subject during the past two Congresses proved this once again. When fear of liability suits and litigation costs drives valuable, lifesaving products off the market because their makers cannot get raw materials, consumers are the ones to suffer. When companies divert money from developing new lifesaving products to replace old sources of raw materials supplies, consumers are again the ones to suffer. When one company must spend millions just to defend itself in lawsuits over a product it did not even design or make--for which it simply provided a raw material worth 5 cents--it is the consumer that suffers the most. 
Based on the testimony we heard in 1994, I, along with my distinguished colleague from Arizona, committed to forging a solution to remedy this immediate threat to our national public health. That year, and again in the 104th Congress, we introduced the Biomaterials Access Assurance Act, which we reintroduce again today. This bill will establish clear national rules to govern suits against suppliers of raw materials and component parts for permanently implantable medical devices. Under this bill, a supplier of raw materials or component parts could be sued only if the materials they supplied do not meet contractual specifications, or if they properly can be classified as a manufacturer or seller of the whole product. They could not, however, be sued for deficiencies in the design of the final device, 
the testing of that device, or for inadequate warnings with respect to that device. 
Our colleagues recognized the need for that bill last year, and so passed it as part of the 104th Congress' product liability reform bill. Unfortunately, President Clinton vetoed that bill, but in his message to Congress, he made clear that he viewed the biomaterials provision portion of it as, in his words, `a laudable attempt to ensure the supply of materials needed to make life-saving medical devices.' We hope that he continues to see the provision in that light. 
I believe that enactment of this bill would help ensure that America's patients continue to have access to the best lifesaving medical devices in the world. We must act now, however. This piece of legislation is preventative medicine at its best and is just the cure the patients need.

Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I thank my friend and colleague from Delaware, not, of course, simply for yielding, but for his continuing leadership on this vital question of whether or not NATO will be enlarged. 
Mr. President, this is one of those moments in history when we are presented with an extraordinary opportunity to do something that will shape the course of the coming decades. So often so much happens in our professional lives, our personal lives, that it is hard to distinguish between the important and the very important. This, in my opinion, is a very important resolution, beginning as it does the consideration by the 105th session of Congress of the critical question of whether the North Atlantic Treaty Organization will extend memberships beyond its current role. 
This resolution reaffirms the shared commitment expressed repeatedly by strong bipartisan majorities in the Congress to the continued viability of our transatlantic alliance and to its irreplaceable contribution to peace and stability in Europe, and therefore to the vital strategic and economic and moral interests of our own country. 
Mr. President, we are at a moment which, while the details may differ, is not unlike the time after the Second World War when enlightened leaders of both parties in this country, learning the lessons of their departure from the field of international relations after the First World War, came together and supported the reconstruction of post-World War II Europe, building not just the strength of those countries, the economic might that followed, but building therein great democracies that have become once again our best friends and allies. 
We are at such a moment after another war, the cold war, has ended. The question is whether we will see forward boldly and honorably to understand that whether or not we will accept the nations that lived under Soviet domination into the community now of free nations will have a substantial effect on our security and our economic strength and our moral vitality for decades to come. 
For unless we close our eyes to history, we must recognize that we are vitally interested in what goes on in Europe. We are connected. Our pasts and our futures are linked economically, politically, culturally, and militarily. Those ties did not break away with the fall of the Berlin Wall. Indeed, they will become more complex and more compelling and more productive over time. Over time, NATO has proved itself the most enduring guarantee that we and our allies in Europe are brought together in peace and freedom, not in tyranny and war. 
NATO remains today the world's single most effective partnership of like-minded countries, sharing the burdens of international security and preserving the conditions in which open societies and free markets flourish. 
Enlarging NATO means enlarging the transatlantic sphere of peace and stability, of peace and prosperity. It means honoring our promise made repeatedly throughout the cold war that we would be there when that cherished moment arrived to support the new independent nations of Central and Eastern Europe in their struggle for democracy and a better life. It means helping to ensure that those countries will continue their democratic development and take their place peacefully in the expanding community of freedom. And it means expanding the family of nations that will share with us Americans the burden of protecting the stability and peace of the world and expanding the family of free peoples of the world. 
Mr. President, this resolution expresses, in very strong and very clear language, our conviction across party lines that NATO enlargement is the best way to ensure a peaceful, stable, free future in Europe. It also makes clear that we must work with Russia, which is inherently and, of course, part of the European community and critical to the future stability of Europe. We must work with Russia to reach common ground on European security. 
Proceeding steadfastly with our plans to enlarge NATO, I think, will make that task easier. For where we leave doubt, there will be further doubts created. Where we are uncertain, there are those who will take advantage of our uncertainty. 
The fact is that NATO is today and has always been a defensive alliance. It poses no threat to its neighbors. Instead, it offers the confidence of secure borders and stable relationships. And by making it clear that the NATO enlargement process is ongoing and open to other countries as they qualify, it alleviates the threat of future conflict between competing blocs. NATO does not seek to target nations for exclusion. It seeks to engage nations on the high ground of democracy and free market economics and to become partners with them. 
Mr. President, this week there is a remarkable statement of opinion in Newsweek magazine, the February 10, 1997, issue, written by Andre Kozyrev, former Foreign Minister of Russia. The title is `NATO Is Not Our Enemy.' I will read briefly from the article.  
The Russian people [former foreign minister Kozyrev says] must be told the truth. And the truth is, NATO is not the enemy. Indeed, fighting the West's proposal to admit Central European countries to NATO is self-defeating [for Russia], because Russia has no means of stopping it. The vital Commonwealth of Independent States alliance would surely fall on hard times if it is burdened with opposition to NATO. What member-nation [of the CIS] would remain part of such a group, when the NATO seal of approval often brings investment, advancement and economic enhancement? As foreign minister, [Kozyrev writes] I found that every Eastern European leader who wanted NATO membership saw it primarily as an economic move, not a military one. Opposing that will weaken our [that is to say the Russian] economic position in Central Europe. 
The West must recognize this as a domestic-policy crisis, [which is to say a domestic policy crisis in Russia] resist capitulation to the old guard and deal with it in a balanced fashion. An entirely new generation of leaders in our country [Russia] is waiting for this policy shift. To accomplish it, NATO's member-nations must take very difficult and challenging steps. The practical way for Russia to transform NATO is to cooperate with the alliance--and vice versa. 
End of quote from Mr. Kozyrev's remarkable and, I think, very powerful statement. 
Mr. President, NATO enlargement is moving forward thanks to the leadership of President Clinton, the support of a strong bipartisan group here in Congress, the very effective advocacy of NATO Secretary Solana, and so many others around the world. 
We in Congress can play a very important part in this remarkable historical achievement. This resolution which Senator Roth has brought before the Senate today, and which I am proud to cosponsor with him, will provide the President with the support to work with our allies to create the mechanisms by which new members will be welcomed into the alliance and the broad-based bipartisan support with which to go forward to develop a strong NATO-Russia security relationship. 
As its 50th anniversary approaches, the Atlantic alliance remains at the core of America's global strength and at the core of global peace and security. The reach of this alliance should now be extended to those whose histories and policies justify it, just as America's own strategic interests and moral imperatives require it. 
I yield the floor.

 Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I am delighted to join this distinguished group of Senators in introducing legislation to provide tax incentives for the cleanup of brownfields. This legislation will provide a powerful incentive to clean-up these sites. And that clean up will be followed by more jobs and more economic growth in areas that very much need both of those things. I am encouraged by the broad, bipartisan support both here in the Congress and in the administration and in the environmental community and in the business community, to provide tax incentives to get these sites cleaned up. 
Brownfield sites are abandoned commercial and industrial properties that are environmentally contaminated. Developers and lenders avoid these sites both for liability reasons and because the tax incentives for cleaning up these sites is so limited. The result is an urban landscape littered with vacant and abandoned properties--properties which invite crime, depress surrounding housing and commercial prices, and hinder economic growth in these areas. Additionally, by discouraging the clean-up of brownfields, we are encouraging the development of undeveloped areas known as greenfields. 
This bill is simple: it allows taxpayers who purchase contaminated properties to deduct the costs of cleaning up brownfields in the year that cleanup expenses occur. This tax incentive would apply to existing and future empowerment zones and enterprise communities, in areas with a poverty rate of 20 percent or more and in adjacent industrial and commercial areas and in existing brownfields pilot areas as designated by the Environmental Protection Agency. Currently, a taxpayer who buys a contaminated property and cleans it up must spread the costs of that cleanup over time. We expect the cost of this bill to be about $2 billion over 7 years. The administration has estimated that this proposal may bring as many as 30,000 brownfield sites back to productive use. 
In Connecticut, my home State, we know first hand about the problems these brownfield sites can pose for a community. In her soon to be released study of various brownfields sites, Edith M. Pepper of the Northeast-Midwest Institute included the Bryant Electric Plant in Bridgeport, CT, as one of her case studies. As she notes, the Bryant Electric Plant shut down in 1988 after 90 years of operating in Bridgeport's west end. It is no secret that Bridgeport is in difficult shape economically. Closing this 500,000 square foot facility did nothing to help that situation. 
However, as Ms. Pepper notes in her case study of this brownfields site, it appears that hope is on the way. A non-profit development group, the West End Community Development Corp. [CDC] is working to form a large business park on and around the Bryant site. Over $15 million has already been invested in the site, including a significant amount for cleanup. According to city officials, the developer plans to create 300-400 new jobs and invest $20-50 million in Bridgeport's west end. 
The brownfields bill we are introducing today could help in Bridgeport. Undoubtedly it could help in places like New Haven and Hartford as well. 
The bill we are introducing today expands upon a bill that Senator Abraham and I introduced in the last Congress, S. 1542. That bill limited these cleanup incentives to the 104 empowerment zones and enterprise communities that exist in 42 States across the country. I am delighted by today's effort to expand on the number of regions and sites that will be covered in the brownfields legislation and I urge my colleagues to join us in cosponsoring this important legislation.

Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, I yield myself 3 minutes. 
I am honored to stand to support the nomination of our former colleague, Bill Cohen, to be the Secretary of Defense. Being a member of the Armed Services Committee, watching Senator Cohen testify before us this morning, you could not help but be impressed. It was a tour de force--no pun intended here--for our future Secretary of Defense. He was thoughtful, he was well informed, he was strong, and he was, I believe, ready to innovate. I think you could not help but conclude, though much has been made of Senator Cohen's party affiliation, that President Clinton chose Bill Cohen to be our next Secretary of Defense because he was the best person to be our next Secretary of Defense. And, incidentally, he happened to be a Republican. 
This, obviously, is serious business and a serious responsibility Secretary-designate Cohen now undertakes, the security of our country, the first responsibility of our Government; the power, along with the Commander in Chief, to put American soldiers in harm's way. I am confident, because all of us know Bill Cohen. In fact, we are in an unusual position, an advantage that we normally do not have when we consider nominees. We know this person. We know his values. We know his balance. We know his strength, and therefore we know how well prepared he is to be the Secretary of Defense. 
He comes in at a time when America is the unchallenged, strongest nation in the world. Yet, to remain that way, not just for today and tomorrow but for the decades ahead, we must continue to innovate and lead and make tough decisions. Just like America's strongest companies who, after they have completed years in which they have made record profits, their CEO's come back and look for ways to innovate to make sure they will stay successful. That is exactly what Secretary-designate Cohen must, and I am sure will, do as our next Secretary of Defense. This morning he strongly supported the quadrennial defense review and national defense panel as aids to him and us in carrying out that responsibility. 
Madam President, let me conclude simply by saying that this new assignment will test Senator Cohen's strength, his foresight, and his courage. I am absolutely convinced that he is ready to pass those tests and serve our Nation brilliantly. 
I thank the Chair and yield the floor.

Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I am proud to join Senator Hatch is introducing this important capital gains legislation today. 
This bill is nearly identical to S. 959, legislation that I introduced with Senator Hatch in the last Congress. Ultimately that bill had over 40 cosponsors. A variation of that bill was included in the broader budget and tax bill which was approved by the Congress in 1995 but failed to become law. In addition, a version of S. 959 was included in the Centrist Coalition budget, a budget which was crafted by a group of 22 Senators evenly divided between Republicans and Democrats. That package was offered on the floor of the Senate in May of 1996 and received a very respectable 46 votes. 
The capital gains bill we are introducing today contains a broad-based capital gains cut which would allow individuals to deduct 50 percent of their capital gains and a corporate rate of 25 percent. It also has a targeted provision which provides a `sweetener' for investments in qualified small businesses. In addition, it allows taxpayers to deduct losses on the sale of a principal residence, something which is very important in places like my home state of Connecticut as well as in California and Texas. 
This bill gives people at all income levels a reason to put their money in places where that money will help businesses start and grow and that means more jobs for Americans and more economic prosperity for our country. The benefits of this capital gains cut will not flow just to people of wealth. Anyone who has stock, who has money invested in a mutual fund, who owns a home, who has a stock option plan at work, has a stake in capital gains tax relief. This means millions and millions of middle-class American families stand to benefit from this legislation. I often cite data on employee stock options and stock purchase plans in talking about stakeholders in a capital gains cut. A recent count showed that over three hundred American companies with over seven million workers offered these plans. Each of those workers and their spouses and their children stand to gain from this legislation. 
This capital gains bill rewards those people who are willing to invest their money and not spend it. It rewards people who put their money in places where it will add to our national pool of savings. Businesses can draw on this pool of savings to meet their capital needs, expand their businesses and hire more workers. The 1995 Nobel Prize winner in Economics, Robert Lucas, had this to say about capital gains taxes in the fall of 1995: `When I left graduate school in 1963, I believed that the single most desirable change in the U.S. tax structure would be the taxation of gains as ordinary income. I now believe that neither capital gains nor any of the income from capital should be taxed at all.' Professor Lucas went on to say that his analysis shows that even under conservative assumptions, eliminating capital gains taxes would increase available capital in this country by about 35 percent. While we reduce not eliminate the tax on capital in this country, we hope you will consider joining us in cosponsoring this important legislation. 
I would also like to point out that this bill contains a targeted sweetener for investments in qualified small businesses. This is an attempt to promote investments in small businesses, the firms that are driving job creation in our economy. We expect these provisions to be very helpful to the kinds of small businesses we need for our future, the high technology companies that will be the source of new jobs in the next century. The bill provides a 75 percent exclusion of capital gains from sales of investment in qualified small business stock held more than three years. In addition, it allows a 100 percent deferral of capital gains, after the three year period, if proceeds from the sale of qualified small business stock are rolled over within 60 days into another qualified small business stock. If the taxpayer continues to roll into qualified stock, and holds that stock for at least a year, this deferral could continue indefinitely. 
Before I go any further, I must give credit where credit is due. The targeted provisions of this legislation build on the fine work of Senator Dale Bumpers, who has been a leader in providing incentives for start-up businesses to attract capital. He worked mightily to have a targeted incentive piece included in the 1993 reconciliation bill and he succeeded. The legislation we are introducing today builds on, and we hope, improves, on that targeted incentive. 
I would also like to note that I am also joining Minority Leader Daschle today as a cosponsor of his Targeted Investment Incentive and Economic Growth Act of 1997. That proposal contains a capital gains rollover provision which contains features of a targeted rollover piece I introduced in the last Congress, S. 1053, as well as features from the targeted section of the bill I am introducing with Senator Hatch today. Senator Daschle's legislation is also very helpful insofar as he improves upon the targeted capital gains bill we passed in 1993, much in the same way the broader capital gains bill being introduced today does. 
I am also delighted that Senator Daschle's bill incorporates a version of a bill I introduced in June of 1993, The Equity Expansion Act of 1993. That bill created a preferred type of stock options for companies willing to offer stock options to a wide cross section of their employees. Under current law, taxpayers are taxed on a stock option when they exercise their right to buy stock, not when they sell that stock. The perverse effect of taxing this paper gain is that many people feel compelled to sell their stock when they exercise their option to buy it in order to pay the tax. The Equity Expansion Act began with the premise that we ought to encourage people to hold their investment in their company. It changed the taxable event from the date of exercise to the date of sale for a new class of stock options known as performance-based stock options [PSOs]. Under my bill, as under the bill being introduced by the Minority Leader, in order to qualify for this new class of stock options, at least half of a company's stock options would have to go to non-highly compensated employees. 
In addition, 50 percent of any capital gain on these PSO's would be exempt from tax if they are held by the taxpayer for more than two years. I hope this will prove a powerful incentive for employees to buy and hold the investments they are making in their company. 
In closing, I applaud both Senator Hatch and Minority Leader Daschle, in their efforts to promote economic growth by changing the way we tax investment in this country. They have done yeoman's work on this issue and I hope that we will be able to move forward in a bipartisan way to make these incentives a reality in the very near future.

 Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, since 1983, the United States Congress and the German Parliament, the Bundestag, have conducted an annual exchange program for staff members from both countries. The program gives professional staff the opportunity to observe and learn about each other's political institutions and convey Members' views on issues of mutual concern. 
A staff delegation from the United States Congress will be chosen to visit Germany April 12 to April 26 of this year. During the 2-week exchange, the delegation will attend meetings with Bundestag members, Bundestag party staff members, and representatives of numerous political, business, academia, and media agencies. Cultural activities and a weekend visit in a Bundestag member's district will complete the schedule. 
A comparable delegation of German staff members will visit the United States for 3 weeks this summer. They will attend similar meetings here in Washington and visit the districts of congressional Members. 
The Congress-Bundestag exchange is highly regarded in Germany, and is one of several exchange programs sponsored by public and private institutions in the United States and Germany to foster better understanding of the politics and policies of both countries.

Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I would like to take a few moments to acknowledge the Sons of the American Revolution, Gen. David Humphreys Branch, and the East Haven Historical Society. In a combined effort, these three groups have placed a marker on the northeast corner of the East Haven Town Green as a memorial to the Marquis de Lafayette, general in the Continental Army. General Lafayette and his troops camped on that site en route to support the American and French forces at Providence, RI, on July 26, 1778. 
The dedication took place on May 27, 1996, in observance of Memorial Day. The ceremony included planes from the Connecticut Air National Guard flying overhead. Mayor Henry Luzzi of East Haven introduced State Representative Michael P. Lawlor, 99th District, as the guest speaker. Representative Lawlor spoke of General Lafayette's concern for our newly formed Government and his firm dedication to the cause of freedom. General Lafayette served at his own expense as a volunteer using his personal funds to supply the troops under his command and soon reached virtual bankruptcy. Additionally, he forged a friendship between two nations which has lasted to the present time. When he died in 1834, soil from each of the individual United States was placed on his grave. I commend the Sons of the American Revolution, Gen. David Humphreys Branch, and the East Haven Historical Society for their efforts and dedication to preserving the history of the United States.

 Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the 220th anniversary of the U.S. Cavalry. The anniversary occurred on December 16, 1996. 
It was in the town of Wethersfield, CT, under orders by the First Continental Congress, that Revolutionary troops organized the 1st Cavalry Regiment in the Continental Army. Today, the town of Wethersfield, located in my home State of Connecticut, is proud to be recognized as the birthplace of the U.S. Cavalry. 
Recognized by the U.S. Department of the Army's Center of Military History, the 2d Continental Light Dragoons--Sheldon's Horse--were organized in Wethersfield. This was the first dragoon regiment to become a part of the Continental Army. Training ground for this regiment had been created by a Wethersfield native, Capt. Benjamin Tallmadge. This regiment made numerous contributions in the Revolutionary War by participating in combat in northern New Jersey and the defense of Philadelphia. 
The town of Wethersfield played a vital role in America's independence. From the historic Webb House, where Gen. George Washington met with Comte de Rochambeau to discuss strategies for the Battle of Yorktown, to the modern development of the Silas Deane Highway, the quaintness of Wethersfield is intermingled with the heroic greatness of the U.S. Cavalry. With origins in Wethersfield, the U.S. Cavalry fought epic battles at Brandy Station during the Civil War and the Punity Expedition before World War I.
