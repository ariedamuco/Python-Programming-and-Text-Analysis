 Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, because of a tremendous bipartisan effort, and the support of many of our nation's local community leaders, a step toward justice and fairness for Haitian refugees will be taken by this Congress. 
The effort began on November 11, 1997, and will culminate in the passage of this omnibus budget bill. 
My colleagues, both in the Senate and the House deserve many thanks: Senator Connie Mack, Senator Kennedy, Senator Abraham, Representatives Meek, Conyers, Diaz-Balart and Ros-Lehtinen. The support of the White House was instrumental in reaching the final agreement to include this legislation in the omnibus appropriations bill. In both chambers, with both parties, the Haitian Refugee Immigration Fairness Act gained the support needed for passage. 
In so many instances, this legislation meant life or death for the refugees who came here seeking safety from persecution. In the field hearing, held in Miami last December, Amnesty International stated unequivocally that the safety of refugees who were deported to Haiti could not be guaranteed. 
I was so appreciative, not only of the bipartisan support that this legislation received, but of support that crossed national lines as well. From the beginning, the Hispanic community: Fraternidad Nicauaguense, the Bloque de Apoyo a la Unidad Nicaraguense, Unidad Hondurena, the Cuban-American community, and others have joined together to help their Haitian brethren achieve immigration fairness. 
The measure of this legislation's impact can best be seen through the eyes of those individuals who were most impacted by the previous state of affairs. I had the opportunity, the pleasure, to meet many of them at our hearing in Miami. Every audience member was moved by their testimony, by the personal accounts of their experiences in Haiti, and the brutality that they fled. 
I had the opportunity to meet others in this category on my trips to Haiti, and my visits to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Even in these harsh conditions, the spirit and determination of these brave individuals was remarkable, struggling to liberate themselves and their families from persecution and brutality. They are following in the tradition of fighters for freedom and justice worldwide. 
Our nation has, since its foundation, served as a refuge of those seeking justice and safety. The evolution of our country's current refugee policy is in many ways to ensure that we avoid situations, such as the one that developed, close to my home state, in the time leading up to World War II. The vessel St. Louis moored within sight of the city of Miami for several days, filled with passengers of the Jewish faith, fleeing the violence in Europe. Our country refused them safety. The passengers returned to Europe, many of them to their certain death. 
Since then, beginning with specific refugee legislation in the decades after the war and developing into the Refugee Act of 1980, the United States of America has offered freedom and sanctuary to those fleeing persecution, brutality, and human rights abuses. 
The bipartisan effort that led to the passage of the Haitian Immigration Fairness Act ensures that we maintain this valued tradition in the United States. We will treat Haitian national refugees in the same manner as we have treated similarly situated individuals over the last decades. 
In relation to one aspect of the legislation, I wanted to clarify the intent of the section dealing with stays of deportation. The intent of this legislation is that the INS would not seek to remove a qualified spouse or the child of a qualified alien who has applied for relief under this legislation, and received a stay of deportation or removal. 
Again, many of my colleagues in the Senate and the House deserve thanks for their tremendous support on this effort. It will make a difference in the lives of many individuals who are a part of our vibrant South Florida community. They will no longer be in immigration limbo, and can continue to build their part of the American dream.

Mr. GRAHAM. There are two principle reasons I support extension of Section 29 and 45. First, in a period where America is continuing to increase its dependence on foreign oil, we need to develop alternative fuel technologies to prepare for the day when foreign supply of oil is reduced. These tax credits have spurred the production of fuel from sources as diverse as biomass, coal, and wind. America will desperately need fuel from these domestic sources when foreign producers reduce imports. 
Second, the alternative fuels that earn these tax credits are clean fuels. For example, the capture and reuse of landfill methane prevents the methane from escaping into the atmosphere. I will support my colleagues in an effort next year to extend these provisions.

Mr. GRAHAM. I join my colleague from Florida in making this inquiry. Since enactment of the provision by the Senate, I have noted that a new section (d) has been added in conference, which provides that the President may waive the `requirements' of this section in the national security. I note that the term `requirements' may require clarification. As I understand the import of this language, it does not allow the President to waive the section as a whole, but only those part that relate to `requirements' on the Secretaries of Treasury and State. Is that the understanding of the Senator from North Carolina?

 Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to salute one of Florida's most dedicated health care service providers. On October 17, 1998, the Economic Opportunity Family Health Center of Miami both honored and said farewell to their President and CEO, Ms. Jessie Trice. Ms. Trice's retirement concludes a career of more than thirty years devoted to the improvement of health care services in under privileged communities throughout both Florida and the nation. She is a true humanitarian, and has been locally and nationally recognized for her tireless advocacy on behalf of the affordable and accessible services primary care centers provide vulnerable populations. Because of her efforts, these centers have garnered support at all levels of government, and they remain a vitally important force in the health care continuum of needy communities. 
Jessie Trice is both a community leader and policy maker. Her distinguished resume includes positions as Public Health Nurse Supervisor and Chief of Nursing Services at the Dade County Department of Public Health, Executive Director of the Visiting Nurses Association, and Assistant County Nursing Director of the Children and Youth Project. Her service as the Chairwoman of the Health Choice Network, Inc., the Screening Committee of the National Association of Community Health Care Centers, and the Legislative Committee of the Florida Council of Primary Care Centers, as well as her membership on the Board of Directors of the Primary Care Centers, Inc., are a testament to her superb leadership abilities. 
In 1970, President Richard Nixon recognized Ms. Trice's outstanding contributions and proven expertise in this field by appointing her to serve as a delegate to the White House Conference of Children. She was named Florida Nurse of the Year in both 1972 and 1984, and made Distinguished Honoree by the Academy of Black Women in the Health Professions. She has been named to the lists of `Who's Who' for Health Care Professionals, American Women, and American Business Leaders. 
Mr. President, the list of those who support and admire the work of Jessie Trice is long and distinguished. I am grateful for the work she has done on behalf of the state of Florida, and I ask my colleagues to join me in extending my congratulations for her thirty years of service in the field of health care services. May her examples of dedication and hard work continue to be of inspiration to others.

Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I would like to express my support of S. 1222, the Estuary Habitat Restoration Partnership Act of 1998 which we are about to pass. I am co-sponsor of the original version of this bill, and I am also a co-sponsor of S. 1321, introduced by Senator Torricelli of New Jersey, which reauthorizes and provides funding for the National Estuary Program. A modified version of S. 1321 is included in the version of S. 1222 that we are reviewing today. The Estuary Habitat Restoration Partnership Act of 1998 will invigorate our existing programs to protect and restore our nations' estuaries. 
The Florida coastline boasts some of the richest estuarine areas in the world. These brackish waters, with their mangrove forests and seagrass beds, provide an irreplaceable link in the life cycle of many species, both marine and terrestrial. Florida's commercial fishing industry relies on these estuaries because they support the nurseries for the most commercially harvested fish. 
Today, many of Florida's estuaries have been damaged from the impacts of increased development, non-point source pollution, and increased nutrient loads. Four of Florida's estuaries are currently a part of the National Estuary Program (NEP)--Sarasota Bay, Indian River Lagoon, Tampa Bay, and Charlotte Harbor. The NEP is charged with the responsibility of addressing point and not-point sources of pollution in addition to restoring and maintaining the chemical, physical, and biological integrity and maximizing the ecological and economic productivity of our nation's estuaries. The NEP has been working over the last twelve years to develop implementation plans for the 28 estuaries in the program that will achieve these goals. In testimony before the Appropriations Subcommittee on the VA-HUD and Independent Agencies, the Association of National Estuary Programs testified that today, 17 of the NEP estuaries are in the implementation phase of their programs and it is anticipated that by 1999 the entire national program will have reached the implementation phase. 
Three of the four Florida estuaries in this program have reached the implementation phase of their restoration plans. The Sarasota Bay National Estuary Program began in 1988. It identified several key focus areas for restoration: reducing nitrogen pollution to increase sea grass coverage; constructing salt water wetlands; and building artificial reefs specifically for juvenile fish habitat. Since 1988, nitrogen pollution to the Bay has been reduced by 28-38 percent, with approximately 22 percent of the lost sea grasses and 6 percent of the lost salt water wetlands being restored. It is estimated that Sarasota Bay now supports an additional 49 million fish, 33 million crabs, and 150 million shrimp than it supported 10 years ago. 
The continuation of our success is essential to the state of Florida. As I mentioned, our estuarine systems are home to marine and terrestrial species that form the cornerstone of critical natural habitats. They also are extremely valuable to the state's economy. For example, as Professor Walter Milon of the University of Florida testified on July 9 before the Environment and Public 
Works Committee, the Indian River Lagoon estuary stretches 156 miles along Florida's east coast, covering five counties which are home to more than 1 million permanent residents and more than 6 million visitors each year. The number of residents in this region is expected to increase by 24 percent between 1995 and 2005, increasing stress on this fragile system. Dr. Milon indicated that recreational fishing contributes approximately $340 million per year to the local economy; swimming, boating, water sports, and nature observation activities contribute approximately $287 million each year; commercial fishing of clams, oysters, and crabs contributed nearly $13 million annually; and residential land values were enhanced by approximately $825 million or an annual value of $33 million. The lagoon is estimated to bring more than $725 million to the local economy each year. 
Together, the provisions of the original S. 1222 and S. 1321 will provide authorization for much needed funding to be used for execution of these implementation plans. By establishing the concrete goal of restoring 1,000,000 acres of estuary habitat by 2010 and providing a mechanism to achieve this goal, the Estuary Habitat Restoration Partnership Act of 1998 will energize existing local estuary programs to make forward progress on habitat restoration. I am particularly pleased that provisions exist in today's version of S. 1222 to provide funding priority for those estuary habitat restoration projects that are part of an approved Federal estuary management or habitat restoration plan. 
Today's version of S. 1222 has incorporated S. 1321, which reauthorizes the NEP to continue developing and implementing estuary restoration plans. However, there are some modifications to the original language that Senator Torricelli introduced, including a reduction of the funding levels by 50 percent and the length of the authorization from 5 years to 2. I understand that one of the items on the agenda in the Environment and Public Works Committee for next year is to reauthorize the Clean Water Act which will provide an excellent opportunity to extend the NEP authorization. I look forward to this critical project for the Environment and Public Works Committee. 
Together, the provisions of today's Estuary Habitat Restoration Partnership Act of 1998 will provide much needed support to estuary restoration efforts in the state of Florida and throughout the nation. 
In addition to the provisions pertaining to our Nation's estuaries, today's version of S. 1222 also includes provisions of a bill introduced by Senator Faircloth, S. 1219, the Pfisteria Research Act. Earlier this year in the Indian River Lagoon area, the estuary system had several outbreaks of pfisteria-like disease. This was attributed by some to be caused by outbreak of toxic organisms due to increased nutrient loading in the estuary waters. In 1996, a `red tide' caused by algal bloom was believed to have caused the death of 151 manatees off the southwest coast of Florida. The research program included in today's version of S. 1222 authorizes research into the eradication or control of pfisteria and other toxins--an action that will provide vital information that may be used to prevent future occurrences of aquatic toxin outbreaks. 
I am pleased to offer my support of S. 1222, the Estuary Habitat Partnership Restoration Act of 1998.

 Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to make some remarks regarding S. 2131, the Water Resources Development Act which passed the Senate by unanimous consent on October 8, 1998. 
I would like to first thank my colleague Senator Mack from Florida for his partnership on our efforts to produce a WRDA bill that reflects the needs of our State. I would also like to thank Senator Chafee, Sentor Baucus, and Senator Warner for their leadership on this critical piece of legislation. The 1998 WRDA bill includes many key items for the State of Florida, a few of which I would like to highlight today. 
As you know, water issues in Florida include everything from coastal protection to inland water quality management and from statewide drought to statewide flooding. Our history dealing with water resources has caused some of our own problems that we seek to correct today. 
In the area of the Everglades and South Florida Ecosystem Restoration: The Everglades restoration project is the largest restoration program in the world. This vast region, which is home to more than six million Americans, seven of the ten fastest growing cities in the country, a huge tourism industry, and a large agricultural economy, also encompasses one of the world's unique environmental resources. Over the past 100 years, manmade changes to the region's water flow have provided important economic benefits to the region, but have also had devastating effects on the environment. Biological indicators in the form of native flora and fauna have shown severe damage throughout south Florida. 
The work of the Army Corps of Engineers is essential to this restoration effort. The critical projects authorized in WRDA 1996 have demonstrated substantial success. The South Florida Ecosystem Restoration Task Force, the Governor's Commission for a Sustainable South Florida, local sponsors, and the Army Corps have completed a review of over 100 potential projects, narrowed the list to 35 and ranked them in order of priority for accelerating the restoration of the South Florida ecosystem. 
In addition to this extension, the WRDA 1998 bill includes a $27 million authorization for the Hillsboro and Okeechobee Aquifer Storage and Recovery Project. This technology is presently used to create subsurface reservoirs for drinking water. The Army Corps is considering the use of Aquifer Storage and Recovery as a water storage technology for use in implementation of the Restudy. Our action to authorize work on this project will allow early evaluation of the viability of this technology. 
Finally, the WRDA 1998 bill includes clarifying language that expenditures by the state of Florida for land acquisitions in the Caloosahatchee River basin are eligible for Federal reimbursement if they are identified as part of the restudy when it is released in July 1999. Our action assures the State of Florida that acquired lands that become part of the restudy will be eligible for Federal reimbursement. 
In the area of water supply: One of the unique aspects of the Florida water system is that we frequently experience periods of drought and periods of flooding. This is the nature of a system that has been modified by human manipulation of natural flowways. In the State of Florida, our growing population coupled with the need to protect our natural systems has created a water quality challenge. From 1995 to 1996, Florida added 260,000 new residents, or the equivalent of four new Daytona Beaches. Between 1980 to 1995, Florida's public water supply needs increased 43 percent more than double the national average of 16 percent. This shows no signs of slowing down. Today, Florida continues to grow at the rate of more than 800 people per day. 
Many other States on the eastern seaboard face similar challenges. For example, a recent article in New Jersey Monthly stated that New Jersey leads the nation in the percentage of land mass that is classified as having a high vulnerability for serious water quality problems. According to the U.S. EPA, more than 66 percent of the State falls into the most precarious category for water quality. 
In addition, as early as 1983, a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers study stated that deficits in water supply for the area in Virginia south of the James River are projected to be as much as 60 million gallons per day by the year 2030. Ground water withdrawals have caused water level declines of as much as 200 feet in some areas. In the State of New York, water levels in aquifers are predicted to decline by as much as 18 feet and low flows in streams may be decreased by 90 percent in parts of Long Island. 
In each of these cases, water supply is tied to water quality. Problems such as groundwater overpumping, damage of existing wetlands, and saltwater intrusion of aquifers can cause irreparable damage to our water systems and surrounding ecosystems. For example, since 1906 wetland acreage in the State of Florida has shrunk by 46 percent resulting in a loss of both critical habitats and a key link in the replenishment of our aquifers. The development of alternative water sources that will help to resolve these types of issues and will allow States to provide for future water supply needs without sacrificing environmental protection is my goals. 
The WRDA 1998 bill includes a requirement for EPA to study water availability and make recommendations on the adequacy of our existing water supply. The study will form the basis of future water supply programs. The State of Florida is already taking the water supply issue seriously, and in 1998 alone has budgeted $75 million in regional and State funds for development of alternative water supplies. I am looking forward to working with my colleagues on the Environment and Public Works Committee during the next Congress to address the water quality and water supply needs of the State of Florida. 
Together, these initiatives will protect the future of the State of Florida by protecting our water resources that are so critical to our environment and our economy.

Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, for those here on the floor and those who may be watching this on C-SPAN, I apologize, because we are about to enter some very arcane and not particularly exciting discussion. But it is necessary in order to understand what this amendment does and what it doesn't do. First, what it doesn't do. 
Mr. President, this amendment starts by saying on page 26 of the bill that is before us that we will strike lines 3 through line 5 on page 27. So for those of you who have access to the legislation, I ask if you will turn to those pages. If you don't have access to the amendment, I am going to make a statement. 
Unfortunately, both of those who have spoken--well, Senator Wyden is on the floor. I would like him to listen to this statement. If he feels I am misstating--since it is not my intention to have to read all of this language--would he please indicate where I am misstating. But as I read the amendment, with the exception of changing the numeration--that is, what was listed as an (a) in the Senate Finance committee language is listed as a small paragraph letter (i) in the McCain amendment number 3711. With the changes of those numerations, the words in the amendment are almost verbatim to the words that are being stricken from line 3 on page 26 through line 5 on page 27. Is that an accurate statement?

Mr. GRAHAM. If there is a difference, I will yield to indicate that. In my reading of the amendment, I cannot find any substantial difference between the language that was in the Finance Committee's draft and the language that is in this amendment. We are striking out on the one hand and reinserting on the other. The difference begins with a new subparagraph added by the amendment, which is subparagraph Roman numeral (iv), beginning on line 16 of page 2 of the amendment through line 22. It is my understanding that paragraph will be deleted. 
</TEXT>
</DOC>

<DOC>
<DOCNO>105-graham-fl-10-19981008</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
Mr. GRAHAM. So that is not an issue of controversy. 
And Roman numeral (v), which is the new language under discriminatory tax, is acceptable. 
Two-thirds of the amendment that is offered is not in contest, either because it is in existing law--so whether we adopt the amendment or not, it is still going to be in the legislation--or it is acceptable. 
All the controversy, therefore, focuses on page 3, lines 5 through 23, which is the language that has been referred to as the `nexus' language. This language essentially as presented in this amendment was before the Senate Finance Committee. It was reviewed by the Senate Finance Committee and, on the recommendation of both the majority and minority legal counsel, was stricken from the bill. 
What was the basis, Mr. President, that the Finance Committee made such a recommendation to strike what is now the essence of lines 5 through 23 from this bill? These are the arguments that the Finance Committee was persuaded by. It determined that the areas of nexus, which relate to the subject of how much of a presence does an entity such as a business have to have in a State to make it subject to that State's tax authority. It determined that the areas of nexus were sufficiently clear under today's law that it was inappropriate to include such standards in Federal legislation. 
The basis of nexus: As the Presiding Officer, who was a distinguished member of the State Senate of the State of Wyoming, knows and from his professional career as a CPA, nexus has traditionally been determined by State law, not by Federal law. Each State determines what is the necessary presence for taxation. There are, of course, limits as to State law under constitutional provision for interstate commerce. But within that standard, the States have been the determinative bodies. 
According to the Finance Committee staff, there has only been one other Federal law, and that was passed 40 years ago, in 1959, which relates to the issue of federalization of what those standards of nexus would be. 
So the essential position of the Finance Committee was, first, that this is a matter that was being properly dealt with at the State level, and that was not a compelling reason why we should federalize the issue of nexus. 
Second, they found that no State is currently attempting to enforce a tax collection obligation on the basis of the circumstances outlined in amendment; therefore, there was no necessity for this federalization, and that it would lead to potentially increased litigation over the nuances of this language. I am going to talk about that in a moment. 
Finally, that the enactment of this amendment would create special federalized rules for a very small subset of the retail community. And it is inappropriate--for a bill that is intended to cause a timeout, a pause, a moratorium, on State action to allow a commission to develop recommendations on appropriate rules for taxation--for us now to essentially preempt that whole process by federalizing a significant, albeit very niche, area of commerce. 
So those are the reasons that the Senate Finance Committee voted to eliminate this language in the bill. Certainly the Finance Committee was not adverse to the thrust of the bill, because it passed the bill on a 19-to-1 vote. The idea that by failing to include this language we would be `gutting' the bill is, in my opinion, an extreme overstatement. 
Mr. President, beyond those reasons that were given by the Finance Committee, there is also another set of concerns which have come to light as this amendment has been increasingly in the public attention. That is the fact that there are States which either are or are potentially in litigation with various providers within the Internet industry over the question of their tax liability to a State. We have been sensitive to that in this legislation by providing a grandfather clause, which essentially protects the right of those States. As presented, this nexus amendment clause is retroactive, as the discriminatory tax definition in this bill is not covered by the general grandfather clause, and would apply to past events. 
There is concern that the effect of this legislation would be to tilt the playing field in the courtroom of that litigation by making it more difficult on a retroactive basis for the States to make their arguments about an adequate nexus to the State as the basis of taxation of these Internet providers. 
I don't think that this Congress wants to get into the business of intruding itself into ongoing litigation which might involve the State of Mississippi, or the State of North Dakota, or the State of Arizona, or the State of Florida, or any other State. That is not our business--to retroactively insert ourselves into that thicket of litigation. 
Mr. President, it is for those reasons that I believe this amendment is defective. This Senate has adopted rules that provide that, after cloture has been invoked, the only amendments that can be considered are those that are germane to the bill. 
The very fact that the sponsors of this amendment have filed what is a very unusual motion to suspend the Senate's rules as it relates to germanity is an indication that, first, they don't think it is germane; and, second, that under the rules of the Senate it should not be debatable in this postcloture environment. 
As the managers and sponsors of this bill, they have had ample opportunity to get this language included throughout this long and tedious process. They have not done so. Now, in the postcloture environment, they are asking us to waive a fundamental rule of the Senate, which is, after cloture has been invoked, the cloture which was filed by the primary sponsor of the bill, now they want to be able to take up what is tacitly admitted to be a nongermane amendment, an amendment which was rejected after thorough analysis by the Senate Finance Committee, a measure which I think would have the effect of injecting us into litigation and affecting potential litigation between the States and various Internet providers. 
Mr. President, I strongly urge my colleagues that we not adopt this motion, that we not change our rules, that we play by the rules that we have all agreed to, and that we play by the rules that have been in effect between States and the Internet industry in the past, and not retroactively reach back and adopt a provision which could interfere with the normal resolution of pending litigation. 
Having said all of that, Mr. President, it is my hope that while this discussion has been going on, there have been good-faith efforts made to arrive at a resolution of this issue, and it would be my suggestion to have possibly a brief period by suggesting the absence of a quorum so that we might see if in fact we have arrived at a resolution that would obviate the necessity of the several steps that would be required in order to further pursue this matter. I think that would be in everybody's interest. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I appreciate that generosity, and I will not overly indulge. Let me say, we have reached an honorable resolution to this issue which, for those who have been listening to this arcane debate, I will summarize by saying a significant issue will be made prospective in its application and not have retroactive application. Reading the language we have agreed to add to the McCain amendment 3711, which makes a portion of the nexus language prospective, in combination with the definition of `tax on internet access,' which was agreed to earlier, this amendment should not interfere with litigation between States and internet service providers. With that agreement, that has brought the various parties of interest into concurrence. 
What I want to say, Mr. President, is the three people who have been particularly active on this issue, who are on the floor now--Senator McCain of Arizona, Senator Dorgan of North Dakota, Senator Wyden of Oregon--are three of the finest people with whom I have had the privilege to serve in public office. If America was going to judge the quality of its public officials, I would be happy to be judged by these three men. 
As the Senator from Arizona said, we have had some degree of controversy, but that is the nature of the democratic process. If this were a passive and tranquil process where everybody voted 400 to 0, that would be reminiscent of the way in which the Soviet Union used to operate its parliament, not the U.S. Senate. 
I think we have come to not only an appropriate resolution of this specific amendment, but I am proud where we are overall. We have achieved the purpose of having a reasonable period of timeout, with a thoughtful commission to be appointed to study some extremely complicated areas, the intersection of a legal system that is complex in areas of State-Federal relations, telecommunications and a highly complex new set of technologies. 
This is an appropriate area for us to stand back and ask for the assistance of some thoughtful citizens who can bring their wisdom and experience to bear and give us the framework of some policy that then will be returned to the Senate and to the House of Representatives for enactment, as well as to the various State legislatures for their consideration. 
I think we have, at the end of this process, arrived at exactly what our framers of this Constitution intended the legislative branch to do. I am proud to vote not only for this amendment but for the bill on final passage, and I look forward to the commission's work over the next several months and a return to these subjects in the year 2000 or 2002. 
Again, I thank my colleagues for their very significant leadership in bringing us to this position. 
Several Senators addressed the Chair.

Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I also would like to take this opportunity to thank Mr. Russ Sullivan, who is legislative director in my office, and Kate Mahar, who has worked with him. They have been on a fast learning curve on these issues, fortunately, about 12 hours ahead of myself. I publicly thank them for their contribution to this final conclusion.

Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation designed to aid millions of American families with one of their most pressing needs--child care. This legislation would make child care more accessible to millions of families who find it not only important, but necessary, to work. 
In the ideal world, most parents, I believe, would prefer to have their children raised by at least one parent at home. However, for a vast majority of families in America, this ideal is not possible. And for the working poor and many in the middle class of our society, this ideal is a luxury that they cannot afford. 
The legislation which I am introducing today would not solve the child care needs of American parents. However, it would serve to provide a much needed incentive--a jump start--to promote employer provided child care, particularly among our nation's small businesses. 
The legislation I am introducing today would offer a tax credit to those employers who undertake the responsibility of assisting their employees with child care expenses. This bill--the Worksite Child Care Development Center Act of 1998--would modify that part of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 which relates to business tax credits. It would do so by providing child care tax credits to employers for-- 
A one-time 50 percent tax credit, not to exceed $100,000, specifically for facilities start-up expenses, which includes expansion and renovations of an employer-sponsored child care facility; 
A 50 percent tax credit, not to exceed $25,000 annually, for those expenses related to the operating costs of maintaining a child care facility; and 
A 50 percent tax credit, not to exceed $50,000 annually, specifically for those employers who provide payments or reimbursements for their employees' child care expenses. 
One may ask, `Why is this legislation important to American employers and employees?' Mr. President, I submit to you that there are four compelling reasons for the Congress to pass this legislation. 
First, child care is a major concern for American families. We should be concerned about child care because it has become one of today's most pressing social issues. Ask working parents today to identify their top daily concerns, and a large proportion will most certainly identify quality, affordable child care as one of them. 
On June 1st of this year, I hosted a Florida statewide summit on child care, which was attended by over 500 residents of my state who shared with me their concerns, and sometimes their frustrations, about this issue. The feedback that I received from my constituents covered a myriad of issues reflecting the high level of concern that parents have regarding access, quality, and the level of investment we are making in child care. We had five panel sessions moderated and staffed by 25 of Florida's most distinguished professionals in the field of child development and human services and education. The panels covered a wide range of issues from affordability and access, to quality of care, to public-private partnerships between government and businesses. 
I am pleased that I was able to hear from my constituents and from experts regarding the extent and nature of the problem. One participant summed it up well, `The issues addressed in the summit today are concerns that need to continue to be addressed until the needs are met; however, the needs are going to continue to grow as our preschoolers and school-agers go into middle schools.' 
Mr. President, it's no wonder that there is so much interest in the issue of child care. Child care, when it is available, is provided to a child at one of the most important times in that child's life. Indeed, recent research has confirmed what many of us had always believed--that quality child care can positively influence cognitive and social development. Current scientific research tells us that the most crucial period in children's brain development and brain readiness--which determines so much of the course for the rest of their lives--is that time between birth and the age of three. 
Second, America's workforce is changing. The work place has changed dramatically over the past fifty years. In 1947, just over one-quarter of all mothers with children between 6 and 17 years of age were in the labor force. By 1996, the labor force participation rate of working mothers had tripled. The Bureau of Labor Statistics reports that 65 percent of all women with children under 18 years of age are now working. This percentage is not expected to decrease--it is expected to grow. As we enter the 21st century, women will comprise 60 per cent of all new entrants into the labor market. A large proportion of these women are expected to be mothers of children under the age of six. 
The implications for employers are clear. Employers understand well that our nation's workforce is changing rapidly. Those employers who can attract and hold onto the best employees are likely to be among the most competitive. 
Many of our larger corporations and government agencies have recognized this and are already moving in that direction. For example, our nation's military is often cited as having a model child care program for its personnel. Military leaders know well the relationship between a parent's peace of mind and satisfaction with good child care and job performance. 
In my State of Florida, several major firms have taken similar steps to invest in their employees. I recently visited Ryder Corporation's Kids' Corner child care center in Miami where more than 100 children are cared for in a top-notch day care program. Ryder has received many accolades, including being recognized as the Best Employer of Women in the State of Florida by the Florida Commission on the Status of Women. Ryder now plans on extending the care that it provides to the children of employees by establishing a charter school on-site. 
Similarly, NationsBank, formerly Barnett Bank, in Jacksonville, operates a state of the art child care facility for its employees. According to Ms. Mari White, the Senior Vice President of Work Environment Integration at NationsBank--and a member of my informal Advisory Committee on Child Care--this program makes good business sense. She views the availability of child care at the work site as a workforce retention tool for NationsBank as well as a great recruitment tool for new employees. In addition to its day care center, NationsBank also operates a Satellite Learning Center--a charter school for employees' children. 
I commend Ryder Corporation, NationsBank, and the many other corporations in Florida and throughout the nation, which have taken the important step forward in providing child care for its employees. I submit to you that small businesses, which do not have the resources to undertake such efforts, ought to have the ability to offer similar benefits to its employees. My legislation is intended to make it easier for them to do so. 
Third, child care is important for the success of Welfare Reform. This legislation is an important component to our national welfare policy. While most American families struggle with child care, this problem is most acute among the working poor and the middle class. 
In 1996, Congress and the President changed welfare as we knew it. We made fundamental changes to the policies, and the social expectations, relating to work and welfare. The federal government has asked our business community and governmental agencies to work in partnership in keeping the working poor off of the welfare rolls. If we are to see the reforms of 1996 succeed, we must ensure that the means to succeed are provided. 
The working poor--particularly those formerly on welfare--face major challenges associated with staying off of welfare. These challenges include their ability to:

</TEXT>
</DOC>

<TEXT>
Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, first let us come back to what we are fundamentally about. What the Internet Tax Freedom Act says is that there shall be a moratorium, a pause, in the State and local governments' exercise of their otherwise legal authority to impose a tax on access to or transactions consummated over the Internet. 
That is an unusual action. For the Congress of the United States to preempt State and local governments from their otherwise lawful responsibilities to establish what they feel to be appropriate policy for their citizens is an unusual act for the Congress and one which we should only take after careful consideration. 
Why should we exercise such care? Because the consequences of this action, of establishing a moratorium on the taxation of one form of commerce as opposed to all forms of commerce, is to create or to continue a competitive disparity. In this case, it is the comparative disparity between the Main Street retailer, the person who is selling hardware on Main Street and is legally responsible for collecting a sales tax from those who purchase hammers and saws, and those who buy the same hammers and saws over the Internet where they are not subject to the requirement to pay, and the seller to collect, that same sales tax. That is a level of obvious inequity that we would, only under exception circumstances, impose. 
Second, at a time when we are underscoring our commitment to fundamental activities such as law enforcement and education, we are about to drive a major hole in the ability to do so of those levels of government which have the primary responsibility for law enforcement and education, which are our colleagues at the State and local level. I will be giving some current examples, as recently as today's newspaper, of the potential that we are about to open up. 
So it would only take an extremely persuasive argument to convince the Congress of the United States that it ought to inflict that inequality in the marketplace and the threat to the ability to deliver fundamental police, fire, and educational services at the local level as this legislation does. 
What is that rationale? The rationale: This is a new, rapidly evolving technology and we need to have this pause so we can assure that whatever tax policies are developed are developed with uniformity, with nondiscrimination, with predictability, so as not to interfere with the natural growth and evolution of this very important part of our commerce at the end of the 20th century that no doubt will play even a larger role as we go into the 21st. That is the argument for the discrimination and threat to State and local governments for which we are about to be asked to vote. 
I will personally support the basic proposition of a pause. But I will only do so if that pause is for a reasonable period of time, that period of time that we would consider necessary to carry out this review and recommendation as to uniform, nondiscriminatory, predictable tax policy, and, second, that we have a commission, which is going to be making this study, which will represent all of the diversity of interests on this matter and will have a charter broad enough to look at all the questions that are relevant to establishing proper policy for the Internet. 
The argument here is a direct clash between what the Senate Finance Committee found and what the authors of this amendment support. The language which I support is the language which is in the bill that was reported by the Senate Finance Committee with 19 favorable votes. 
If you will look in the bill that appears on our desk, starting on page 22, which is the beginning of the issues to be studied, as stated by the Senate Finance Committee, on page 23, under paragraph (d), the Finance Committee, under the leadership of Senator Roth, who advocated this language, states that:  
. . . there will be an examination of the efforts of State and local governments to collect sales and use taxes owed on purchases from interstate sellers, the advantages and disadvantages of authorizing State and local governments to require such sellers to collect and remit such taxes, particularly with respect to electronic commerce, and the level of contact sufficient to permit a State or local government to impose such taxes on such interstate commerce. 
That is the essence of the language that the McCain-Gregg-Lieberman amendment is going to strike. 
Mr. President, I ask my fellow colleagues, is that unreasonable for a commission we are going to set up to study the effects of Internet taxation on State and local governments and on fairness in the marketplace? Is that language unfair? I do not believe it is. The McCain amendment would strike that language. 
Senator Hutchinson of Arkansas, who has worked very diligently on this issue--and I commend him for his leadership on this matter and his deep understanding of the implications of this issue--has offered a second-degree amendment to the McCain amendment which essentially inserts the same concept of Senator Roth's language that was in the Finance Committee. His amendment would provide for `an examination of the effects of taxation, including the absence of taxation on all interstate sales transactions, including transactions using the Internet, on local retail businesses and on State and local governments, which examination may include a review of the efforts of State and local governments to collect sales and use taxes owed on in-State purchases from out-of-State sellers.' 
That is the amendment that Senator Hutchinson has offered which I think is as eminently reasonable as the language which was offered by Senator Roth in the Finance Committee. So I strongly support Senator Hutchinson's very thoughtful and significant amendment and would go on to say that current events are underscoring the urgency of this look at all forms of remote sales. 
One of the purposes of the underlying bill is to eliminate discrimination. That raises the question, Discrimination in relationship to what? If we end up with a bill that says that the commission cannot even look at the taxation and the effect of that taxation on fairness in the marketplace and on the ability of State and local governments to support their police and fire and schools, we are already guaranteeing that the commission will give us a report that, in order to be nondiscriminatory, the Internet should not be subject to taxation. That would make it the same as catalog sales. That would be a result with very serious long-term implications. 
If, on the other hand, we are able to adopt the language that either was in the underlying bill or the language that Senator Hutchinson has offered, then the commission is going to look at the taxation of all forms of remote sales and will be able to come back with a set of policy regulations that will in fact meet the test of uniformity, nondiscrimination, and predictability, which is the whole purpose of this exercise. 
I said the issue is one that is as topical as today's paper. I refer you to the Washington Post of October 7, on page C-10, which carries a story, `Publisher, Bookseller Join Forces.' 
I will not read the whole article but let me just give you a flavor of what it says: 
Taking direct aim at Amazon.com, publishing conglomerate Bertelsmann AG said [yesterday] it will spend $200 million to buy half of the online book service of Barnes & Noble. 
So, what we have is a major bookseller which already has an on-line service, where they are selling through the Internet as well as through their Barnes & Noble megabookstores; now they have sold half of their on-line service to yet another publisher, the publisher who has well known book houses such as Random House, Doubleday, and Bantam Publishing. They now together own an on-line bookselling firm which is going to try to compete with Amazon.com. 
Why are they doing this? While still a tiny segment of the book retailing marketplace, on-line sales are exploding in popularity. I underscore `exploding in popularity.' 
Seattle-based Amazon.com, founded three years ago, had revenues of $204 million in the first six months of 1998. 
The implications of this to the independent bookstores in Helena, MT, or in Concord, NH, are obvious. In addition to the other benefits of convenience of the Internet, we are now going to have a situation where, if you buy a copy of your book at the Main Street independent bookstore, you are going to be paying the State and local sales tax, but if you buy it over the Internet, you will not be paying the sales tax, and, thus, we are institutionalizing a significant competitive disadvantage.

Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, the second issue which is directly related to the first, the first being the discrimination against the local Main Street sale, is the impact on the ability of local governments and State governments to carry out their fundamental educational, health, and other responsibilities. I will be a Floridian for a moment and cite some of the statistics about the potential impact that an out-of-control moratorium leading to permanent exemption from taxation of the Internet could have on a State such as mine. 
In 1996, the State of Florida collected a total of $11.4 billion in general sales tax revenue. This represented 77.3 percent of Florida's tax revenue generated from sales and excise taxes, excise taxes representing $3.8 billion of that total. 
Florida is not unique in having a high percentage of its tax revenue generated by sales and excise taxes. For instance, Nevada gets 84.3 percent of its total revenue from these two sources; Texas, 81 percent; South Dakota, 78.4 percent; Tennessee, 76.7 percent; Washington, 74.3 percent; Mississippi, 67.3 percent; Hawaii, 61.7 percent; Arizona, 57 percent; North Dakota, 56.8 percent; and New Mexico, 56.7 percent. They are examples of States which are heavily dependent on sales and excise taxes, the kind of taxes that are generated by Main Street activity. 
Currently, mail order nationwide has sales of $100 billion to $120 billion a year. That is the catalog of remote selling. This results in an estimated $3.5 billion to $4 billion in lost sales tax. It is estimated, for instance, in the State of Florida that that would represent something in excess of $200 million a year in lost sales. That is, if the same sale had taken place at the local shopping mall that took place over the remote sales catalog process, it would have been an additional $200 million of sales tax collected. 
Internet sales are expected to grow by the year 2004, not to the $100 billion to $120 billion of current catalog sales, but rather to $400 billion to $500 billion. So Internet sales, by the year 2004, are expected to be four to five times what current catalog sales are. If $100 billion in sales loses $3.5 billion, then the $500 billion would represent a loss of $17.5 billion. For Florida, this means there could be an estimated loss of $875 million in sales tax per year as a result of this removing of the responsibility of the Internet seller to collect the taxes on those transactions. 
Florida's Department of Revenue states that the cost of exempted Internet taxation costs the State $60 million in sales tax revenue and $18 million for the gross receipts tax. This gross receipts tax is what is used to fund our school construction costs. 
Mr. President, the impact of this on State and local governments in their ability to put an adequate number of police on the streets and an adequate fire defense, and particularly an adequate number of schools and teachers and the other support personnel necessary for their educational system, will be extremely vulnerable if this legislation gets out of control. 
This is the amendment which I believe begins to break the dam of reasonability. It is reasonable to have a brief pause to look at all of the implications of Internet taxation. I support that brief pause. It is also reasonable to look at one that is conducted by people who represent all the interests that will be affected by these decisions and that those persons have a charter broad enough to give us wise, comprehensive policy. 
To adopt the McCain-Gregg-Lieberman amendment, which would essentially say we are going to put a blindfold over our eyes and we will not be able to look at those remote sales activities which are the most analogous to what the potential for Internet sales would be, is, in my opinion, to render this legislation ineffective in terms of its purpose and to strengthen the doubts that some of us have that its real purpose is, not to have a thoughtful examination, but rather to have this as the beginning of what will be a permanent bar to State and local governments' ability to manage their fiscal affairs and that the principal loser of this will be the shuttered stores along Main Street of the traditional seller, like the bookstore unable to compete when he or she has to collect the local sales tax but its competitor thousands of miles away does not, 
and will also be seen in the diminishment of vital public services, especially the education of our children. 
So, Mr. President, for those reasons, I strongly support the amendment offered by the Senator from Arkansas as eminently reasonable and consistent with the stated purpose of this legislation, and I urge its adoption.

Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I am pleased today to support, along with my colleague, Senator Mack, legislation to honor former Congressman Dante Fascell by naming the Biscayne National Park Visitors Center after the ex-Congressman of Florida. I had the pleasure to begin my political career as an intern in Congressman Fascell's office and am proud to have had the opportunity to serve with one of Florida's greatest representatives. 
Congressman Fascell's long history of public service began in the Florida House of Representatives after his service in World War II. He was elected to the Eighty-fourth Congress and spent the following thirty-six years in office. During this time Congressman Fascell was influential in both foreign and domestic policy. 
While in Congress, Dante Fascell influenced U.S. foreign policy by co-authoring the War Powers act and chairing the Committees on Foreign Affairs and Arms Control, International Security and Science. In 1969, Congressman Fascell led House action to establish the Department of Housing and Urban Development. This legislation was the first step in efforts to develop economically healthy communities and affordable opportunities for numerous families throughout the nation. He was also a devout supporter of both law enforcement and education on narcotics abuse. 
During his years in Congress, Dante Fascell was an outstanding environmental activist and improved the quality of Florida's natural habitats and wildlife. He battled to protect South Florida's national parks and led the successful effort to establish the national marine sanctuary in the Florida Keys during the 101st Congress. 
The Biscayne National Park visitor center introduces local, national and international visitors to the resources of the Biscayne National Park at Convoy Point, Florida. Its museum features exhibits simulating the park's four main ecosystems: the mangrove forest, Biscayne Bay, the Florida Keys, and the coral reef. The naming of this visitor center will serve as a lasting tribute to Congressman Fascell's persistent efforts to protect the environment for future generations. 
I ask for your support today for our bill which will pay tribute to the service of the former Florida Congressman, Dante Fascell. 
The committee amendment was agreed to. 
The bill (S. 2468), as amended, was considered read the third time and passed. 
The title was amended so as to read: `A bill to designate the Biscayne National Park Visitor Center as the Dante Fascell Visitor Center.'.

<TEXT>
Mr. GRAHAM. Thank you, Mr. President. 
Mr. President, I go back to the same point that I have made on two or three occasions in the debate of this legislation. That is to remind us what we are doing. We are doing quite an exceptional thing. We are telling to 50 States and multiple local jurisdictions that their legal authority to establish what is the appropriate fiscal policy for their citizens is going to be preempted. We are telling them for this purpose that they will be precluded from exercising a judgment that they might otherwise feel is in the interest of their residents and citizens. 
We are doing this in order to provide a pause, a time-out, a brief period in which to sort out the application of public policy, particularly as it relates to tax policy, and the new technology of the Internet. 
I think that we ought to accept the fact that the presumption should be that that preemption of our brethren at the State and local level should be respectfully as brief as possible. We should not easily or excessively indulge in this kind of behavior, particularly when the consequences of this behavior are so obvious and perverse. 
I have used the analogy, and I will use it again, of what we are doing to that Main Street merchant, as if to say that Main Street had a north side and a south side. On the north side, all the people who come to buy their hardware, their clothes, their shoes would be responsible for paying the legislated State and local sales tax, and they would be responsible for collecting it and then remitting it back to the appropriate tax collection authorities. That is not adding a new tax; that is the administration of a tax which the democratic processes in Little Rock or Tallahassee or Salem or any other State capital have prescribed as a means of funding the essential responsibilities of local and State government. We are saying that on the north side that collection has to take place. But on the south side, which is a virtual south side because it doesn't really exist other than in cyberspace, because it is reached through the Internet, there is not such a responsibility to collect on exactly the same hardware, shoes and clothing that we now ask the north side merchant to collect. 
That is a fundamentally unfair proposition. We would be shocked and appalled if someone were to suggest that as a de novo proposition. But that is what we are doing with this Internet Tax Freedom Act. 
The second consequence that we are accepting as a result of this legislation is that we are about to drive a major hole into the ability of local governments and States to finance their most basic responsibility--police who secure our neighborhoods, fire officials who protect us in times of emergency, and most specifically our schools. I will talk in a moment about what has happened to education during this 105th Congress, but I suggest that of all the things we have done or we have not done, the most important education bill that we are going to consider in 1998 is the one that is before us today. 
Now, the question that I ask, and I hope that we receive a response, is why 4 years? I was reticent to object to the unanimous consent to call for a vote at 5:30, but I felt that we ought to allow enough time for the proponents of the 4 years to make the strongest case they could to overcome what I think should be the very strong presumption against making this moratorium excessive, against lengthening by an unnecessary day, week, month or year the time in which we will allow this unfairness in the marketplace and this threat to the ability of State and local governments to carry out their fundamental functions to remain in existence. 
Let's talk about what had been some appropriate times for major tasks. Well, we find in Genesis, chapter 1 and chapter 2, that God created Heaven and Earth in 7 days: `In the beginning, God created the Heaven and the Earth, and the Earth was without form and void and darkness was upon the face of the deep, and the spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters.' And 6 days later Earth, the oceans, the mountains, the valleys, the streams, all of the fishes, the animals, and finally man and woman themselves had been created by God--in 7 days, according to Genesis, chapter 1 and 2. And yet it is going to take us 48 months to figure out what the appropriate tax policy should be for bits and bytes and all of the terminology of the Internet. 
We have some more recent examples that have already been cited. Senator Kerrey said the commission which was responsible for looking at the Internal Revenue Service, clearly one of the most complex agencies administering one of the most complex set of laws that man has ever known, was able to conduct its work in 15 months--3 months less than its original charter, and its work was so good that it formed the basis of the Congress this year enacting the most significant reform of the Internal Revenue Service since it was created. So the fact that they had an 18-month charter to accomplish this very complicated task did not degrade the quality of the ultimate recommendations and the receptivity of Congress to those recommendations. 
We have currently at work a commission studying Medicare. That commission, which was created by this Congress in 1997, was given 18 months to do its work. Medicare is one of the largest and most complex programs that this Congress has ever created. It serves to finance the health care of over 35 million Americans. It is a significant part of a health care industry which represents approximately one-seventh of our gross domestic product. We decided that 18 months was the appropriate time to study the complex Medicare system, and yet it is going to take us 4 years, according to this amendment, to decide what should be the appropriate way for the State of North Carolina to levy taxes on Internet activities that affect the citizens of the State of North Carolina. 
The almost absurdity of this 4-year period leads one to suspect--and we are not by nature a suspicious, certainly not a cynical people, but to suspect--that there are motivations here other than allowing a sufficient amount of time, the amount of time that we normally anticipate would be required to get a undergraduate degree from one of our great colleges or universities, why it would take 4 years in order to study this issue. 
Let me suggest what I think some of the motivations might be. One is that it is going to provide an extended period of freedom from taxation during which there will be new technological applications of the Internet which will have the effect of further widening the gap between Main Street and cyberspace and further exposing local and State government to an erosion of their tax base. 
I spoke yesterday about the new technology of Internet telephony, using the Internet as the means of making long distance telephone calls rather than the traditional line system that we use today. The effect of that is going to be that that Internet telephony will now escape both Federal as well as State taxation for the period of this moratorium. 
I read a statement yesterday by a research group which estimated that by early in the next century potentially 10 percent or more of long distance telephone calls would be made through Internet telephony. 
A second reason for the 4 years might be to develop a political coalition. There are going to be a lot of folks who are going to find it is awfully nice and convenient to not collect this tax. It is awfully nice to have your sales explode, as it was stated that Amazon.com's book sales are exploding. They surely ought to explode. They have a 6- or 7-percent market advantage over that independent bookseller in Fayetteville, AR. They ought to beat the pants off the bookseller. And now we have the situation where the publishers, not going through any intermediary, are going to be selling directly on line. That is great for the American consumer. They are going to have access to a lot of literature and other books at a very attractive price, but the price that society is going to pay is imbalance in the commercial marketplace and a degradation of our police, fire and educational services. 
We, also, as a consequence of this, are going to frustrate local choice. I said this morning that the morning newspaper was filled with articles which are relevant to this debate. This is one that might be of particular interest to our good friend from Arkansas, Senator Bumpers, in which there is, apparently in Arkansas today, an effort being made--and, by the polls, a pretty effective effort--to repeal the property tax in Arkansas and to substitute for the property tax a significant increase in the sales tax. It appears on page A-3 of the Washington Post of October 7 under the headline, `Grass-roots Group Takes Aim At Arkansas Property Tax.' 
I don't know whether this is a good idea or bad idea, for Arkansas to be suggesting this. Apparently the Governor and a lot of other folks think it is a bad idea. But I think we might agree, whether the idea is good or bad, that it ought to be an Arkansas idea, as to how Arkansas wants to organize its State and local taxation. We are about to say in this bill that we are going to make it more difficult for States to have that range of choice. As we erode the base upon which the sales tax is applied, the opportunity for States to do what Arkansas is considering, substituting sales for property tax, is going to be much more difficult because there will be less to substitute with. 
So we are embarked along a path which is not just a temporary one but has the potential of driving a permanent wedge between the Federal Government and States as we rather casually preempt their traditional political choices of how to organize their tax base. 
But those consequences, I think, pale in terms of the final one to which I have already alluded. That is that this is the most important education bill of 1998. 
Mr. President, 1998 started with a lot of enthusiasm for education. The President in his State of the Union talked about reducing class size, particularly in the primary grades, so that children would not have to go to excessively overcrowded classrooms. That was an issue that struck home directly to me. 
My third daughter, Suzanne Gibson, was a wonderful kindergarten teacher. The last year she taught kindergarten at a new elementary school in Miami, Dade County, FL, there were 38 students in her class--38 students in a kindergarten class. My daughter is a wonderful teacher. She now is the mother of triplets, so she is getting to apply what she learned with those 38 students in her class, but I defy anyone to educate thirty-eight 5-year-olds. You may provide custodial services but you do not educate thirty-eight 5-year-olds. 
So we started this year in Washington with a hope and some expectation that the Federal Government might reach out in a hand of friendship and partnership to States and school districts and millions of young boys and girls, and help them with their educational needs. We did not pass the bill that would have allocated an additional 100,000 teachers with Federal assistance in order to reduce class size at the primary grades. Although we had a good experience with a similar action with community police, where we are helping to finance 100,000 community police in a very positive contribution to enhance law enforcement, we did not do that as it relates to primary education. 
Then the President had another proposal for the Congress to assist in helping school districts be able to build enough schools and maintain the old schools so that we could have the classrooms that would be required to significantly reduce class size, particularly in the primary grades. We did not pass that bill either. 
So, now on the 7th of October, with some 2, 3, or 4 days left in this session, we are coming to the most important education bill we are going to pass. What is it going to do? Is it going to help States and local school districts carry out their most important responsibility? No. What it is going to do is to undercut their existing revenue and make it even more difficult to even keep class sizes down to the 38-to-1 level in the kindergarten of Miami, Dade County, FL. 
So, I believe there is absolutely no justification for making this moratorium a day longer than is required to carry out what is a fairly straightforward task. This certainly is no reason to argue it is going to take 4 years, but I look forward to the argumentation that maybe will persuade me as to why 4 years are required for this task when God created Heaven and Earth in 7 days and we reformed the IRS in 15 months. 
Mr. President, I want to vote for this bill because I believe that there is a persuasive argument that a brief moratorium, with the time used by an intelligent group of people who represent all the interests involved, and against a charter which allows them to look at all the relevant improvements, could play a useful purpose. But I could not support a 4-year moratorium, with all the pernicious effects it would have, without any contribution to a greater understanding of the issues involved in Internet taxation. 
So, I urge defeat of this amendment. I urge adoption of the position taken, thoughtfully, by the Senate Finance Committee, which was for a 2-year study. If that is the provision, I will support this legislation. Otherwise, I fear for the consequences.

Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I have no extended remarks. I still don't think we have heard the answer to the question of why does it take 4 years to do this study. The fact is that when this report is available, whatever time, the principal recipient of that report will not be the individual 50 State legislatures, it is going to be us, because in order to implement the recommendations that would allow States to hold the distant seller responsible for collection, we know it is going to require action by the U.S. Congress. 
We are in session just about all the time. So whatever date we set for this report to be submitted, we will likely be here, or close to being here, to receive it and to commence the process to deal with it. 
I still have not heard any rationale as to why we should continue beyond the minimal time necessary for the inequity of the Main Street merchant and the vulnerability of State and local governments' capacity to finance their police, fire, and schools that an extended moratorium implies. 
Thank you.

<TEXT>
Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, as the amendment clearly states, its purpose is to establish to the extent possible under our rules that the moratorium, whatever this body decides its initial length will be, will be that length and that we will not fall into a situation of a `fluid' moratorium, with efforts each year made to extend it further and further. This amendment does not go to the issue of what the length of the initial moratorium shall be. 
The bill before the Senate today, which is the product of the Senate Finance Committee, provides for a 2-year moratorium. There are amendments filed which would extend that up to 5 or 6 years. There are no amendments filed which would reduce the period of the moratorium. So it is fair to suggest that we will be dealing with the moratorium of at least 2 years, possibly longer. The purpose of this amendment is to assure to the extent possible that once we have made that decision, that will be the decision. 
The underlying premise of this bill is an unusual one for the U.S. Congress--not unique, but rarely used. That is, we are about to consider legislation which would preempt every State and every local government in this country, for a period of time, from exercising their otherwise legal powers relative to taxation on Internet access and transactions which are undertaken through the use of the Internet. While it is perfectly appropriate for Congress to decide that the Federal Government should not tax Internet access or Internet transactions, I am concerned we will face a proposal that tells States and local governments that they shall be denied the right to tax these transactions. 
The argument which I find to have some merit is that it is appropriate we have a `pause,' a period in which we can determine what is the appropriate means of taxing this new technology, and that during that pause there should be a prohibition on State and local governments imposing taxes on Internet access or Internet transactions. What I am concerned about is that that pause does not become a permanent slumber, an elongated sleep in which there is a prohibition on State and local government's ability to exercise what is their basic right under our constitutional allocation of responsibilities to raise those revenues necessary to support necessary government programs. 
The Federal Government has on many occasions passed legislation which conditions the receipt of Federal funds. For instance, in the highway bills we have frequently required the States to undertake a certain set of actions, such as setting a speed limit or imposing the requirement of seatbelts or motorcycle helmets or some other item which the Federal Government felt was of sufficient import, that the ability of the State to receive its otherwise due allocation of Federal funds would be conditioned upon their adopting that policy. But in those cases, the States have a choice. If a State believes the Federal requirement is so onerous or so misguided that they will reject it, they can do so and accept the consequences of some reduction in their Federal funds. 
What we are deciding here today is that the States do not have such an option. There will be a prohibition for the period of the moratorium on the State's ability to exercise their policy relative to the taxation of Internet access or Internet transactions. 
What concerns me about this policy is its potential to `morph' from being a temporary pause to being a permanent prohibition. What are some of the risks that are involved in this? One of those risks is the unknown, the unknown potential of this new rapidly developing technology having implications to State and local governments which are beyond our current ability to comprehend. 
As an example, there is an emerging technology--it is not new, it is in place but will probably become more prevalent--which is known as Internet telephony which is essentially where the Internet system substitutes for the normal local or long distance telephone lines as a means of transmitting telephone services. This system, which is currently in use on a limited basis, has the potential of being a very major competitor with the traditional ways in which telephone service has been delivered. 
Probe Research, a telecommunications and data networking market research system, forecasts that the demand for Internet telephony will make these services add up to a $6.3 billion market by the year 2002. That is just some 3 years from now. At that point, according to Probe Research, Internet telephone and fax traffic will account for nearly 10 percent of total long distance traffic, a very significant high-growth industry. 
What does this mean for State and local government? Telecommunications services and cable services are significant sources of revenue for State and local government. The Finance Committee bill, in fact, recognizes this by specifically preserving the Federal Government's taxing authority over many of these areas and preserving the taxing authority of State and local government for access to telephone and cable services. 
Unfortunately, the bill is vague regarding the treatment of such new technologies as Internet telephony. While it specifically protects Federal revenue, it does not clarify that the moratorium does not apply to State and local governments with respect to Internet telephony. I use this example because it is one that is before the Senate, an example that the implications of allowing a specified moratorium to become a longer-term prohibition could have implications on State and local governments and on the fairness in the marketplace between competing forms of commercial transaction, telecommunications, and other aspects of our economy that will be affected that are beyond our ability to currently estimate. 
A second risk is that this moratorium will become ingrained into the law. We have had multiple examples of where laws that were originally passed as temporary moratoriums, or as a temporary benefit, have become de facto permanent. In fact, before this session is over, we may be considering what is referred to as an extender law, which is to add additional months or years to a variety of tax benefits which were initially adopted to have a specified time to limited life. But once in place, once they have developed a political constituency, they have become, for all intents and purposes, permanent provisions in our Tax Code. 
I am concerned that the same development of a political constituency that has gotten used to the fact that they didn't have to pay any tax for access, and particularly any tax on Internet transactions, will develop here and there and will be tremendous political pressure at the conclusion of this moratorium, whenever that might be, for its extension. 
Next, the potential of a long-term moratorium merging into prohibition would create an imbalance on the commercial playing field. I could foresee what is happening in a limited form becoming more prevalent as retail stores begin to open a back office Internet sales shop in order to be able to participate in tax-free Internet sales. So what today is a relatively limited application has the potential of becoming a much larger threat to fairness and parity in the commercial marketplace and to a fundamental source of revenue for State and local government. 
Finally, the potential of the specified moratorium being extended would delay or obviate the accomplishment of the very objective of having the moratorium in the first place, which is to direct a commission, representative of the various stakeholders in this issue, to sort out the conflicting theories and practices and give us a recommendation for some uniform, fair, nondiscriminatory Federal, State, and local policies, as it relates to the use of the Internet as a form of commerce. 
So for all of those reasons, Mr. President, I am concerned, and I think our Members should be concerned, about the prospect of the moratorium, whatever length we finally decide is appropriate, becoming a permanent prohibition on the use of State governments and of their inherent powers relative to the Internet. 
Finally, Mr. President, I think the period of time that is in the Senate finance bill and the period of time that is proposed in various amendments should be plenty to accomplish the objective of this study. We have had a number of recent commissions that have been given a specific time to accomplish their task. 
Two or three years ago, the Congress established an Internal Revenue Reform Commission. It gave that commission 18 months to look at an agency as complex as the IRS. That commission actually completed its work in 15 months, made its report, and this year Congress used that report as the basis of probably the most sweeping reforms of the Internal Revenue Service in a generation. 
Last year, we established a Medicare Commission to look at one of the most complicated, one of the most expensive, one of the most sensitive programs that the Federal Government operates, the program that finances the health care of some 35 million of our older citizens. We gave that commission 18 months in order to issue its report. 
So I suggest that the 2 years that are in the Finance Committee recommendation are ample to carry out a much more focused study of the tax implications of the Internet and that we should take this step by adopting the amendment that I proposed to assure that this moratorium will not morph into a permanent prohibition. 
Mr. President, the fundamental issue here is the issue that underlies this legislation, and that is the desire to have parity, equality, on the commercial playing field among all forms of sales, whether they be the Main Street seller or the remote seller or the cyberspace seller; second, to assure that the Federal Government will not unduly intrude into the areas of historic responsibility for State and local government. It is appropriate for us to attempt to establish some standards for uniformity of treatment and predictability of treatment. It is not appropriate for the Federal Government to preempt State and local governments from their ability to exercise what they think is appropriate tax policy for their citizens. 
So the amendment would provide that once the moratorium has been completed, whatever its length, it would require a three-fifths vote of each House to extend that moratorium for a further period. 
I reserve the remainder of my time.

Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I also add my name to the list in favor of the residual purpose of this legislation, which is a pause of sufficient length to allow a serious study of the implications of Internet technology to be a party in the commercial marketplace, and the role of State and local taxation, as well as international and Federal taxation on this new technology. The purpose of that latter point is to achieve stability, predictability and uniformity in a way in which Internet transactions and access is treated and to avoid there being a discriminatory set of policies that are contrary to the development of their important new technology. I believe the Senate Finance Committee bill achieved that proper balance with a 2-year moratorium. 
What I am concerned about and what this amendment goes to is for that brief pause not to become a permanent prohibition. For the reasons that I have already cited--the rapidly changing nature of this technology and its application, the potential for a constituency to develop that would convert temporary into permanent, the basic unfairness of having some forms of commerce subject to tax while others are given the benefit of a moratorium, the inappropriateness of the Federal Government preempting appropriate State and local judgments for protracted periods of time--all have led me to suggest that we should add to the 2-year moratorium, as it is currently written, an additional protection, and that is at the end of that moratorium, if there is a proposal to extend further, that it would take a 60-vote margin and an equivalent percentage of votes in the House of Representatives in order to do so. 
That would give us some assurance that the objectives that are stated will be achieved, but that this will not become the camel's nose in the tent where eventually the whole body of the camel will be inside the tent. We would be in the position of a permanent prohibition on legal and appropriate policy decisions that have and should be made at the State and local level for the purposes of maintaining not only fair treatment in the marketplace but also the essential resources necessary for State and local governments to carry out their responsibilities in public safety, education and other critical areas. 
Mr. President, I urge the adoption of this amendment, which I consider to be wholly consistent with the objectives of this legislation as stated by its sponsors.

Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to vote favorably on the amendment offered by the Senator from Arkansas. It meets some basic tests. It meets the test of essential fairness. 
We have today in this country a situation in which if Main Street were divided north and south, all of the stores along the northern part of Main Street are meeting their obligations to collect the appropriate State and local tax which is levied by their locally elected officials within that State and which are used to support State and local government. But the stores along the south side of Main Street are treated differently because the south side of Main Street is in another State, in another jurisdiction. Therefore, the sales that are made on the south side of Main Street are not subject to the requirement of collection by the seller as are the stores on the north side of Main Street. 
Therefore, if you go into a clothing store on the north side of Main Street and buy a suit, shirt, dress or shoes, you will pay and the store will collect and remit to the State those taxes which have been levied. But if you are on the south side of Main Street and you are communicating by telephone or through the post office, that seller does not have that obligation to collect the tax. 
This is fundamentally unfair. It is not only unfair to the retail seller on the north side of the street, it is also unfair in that it deprives the community of the resources which are necessary in order to pay for police, fire, health, and particularly educational services, the most expensive service that most communities provide to their citizens. 
In his opening statement, the Senator from Oregon and my colleague and good friend, Senator Wyden, indicated that the fundamental issue here is to treat commerce in a state of neutrality as it relates to technology. I think that very appropriately states the destination that we all want to get to, that we want to treat commerce with neutrality as it relates to the technology with which the commerce is conducted. Clearly, that is not the state of the law today. 
Senator Bumpers gives us an opportunity to achieve that neutrality by saying that all sellers will be responsible for the collection of State and local sales tax whether they are on the north or south side of Main Street. 
In addition to being an issue of fairness, it is an issue of our Nation's future. 
If there is one thing that unites Americans in 1998, it is a recognition that our future as a nation, our future as a cultural leader, as a security leader, and as an economic leader depends, more than any single thing, on the ability of each individual American to be able to perform at their highest level of potential. And it is to our education system that we look to provide for most Americans that means by which they can achieve their full ability. 
We have decided here in the Congress--and it is a position which I generally support also as a member of the Jefferson wing of the Democratic Party--that the best government is that government which is closest to the people who are served. We have, in a number of areas, devolved responsibilities to State and local governments. Those responsibilities also carry with them the obligation of State and local governments to provide the resources to finance those services. 
We have also, Mr. President, thus far, refused to provide for additional partnerships where the Federal Government could enter into programs to assist State and local responsibilities. One of the most dramatic of those has been in the area of school construction. I must personally say, having stated my essential Jeffersonian position, that I believe it is appropriate for the Federal Government to assist local school districts and States in seeing that old schools are rehabilitated and new schools are constructed to meet an increase in student population. This is a particular issue in my State of Florida, Mr. President, as we are entering a state of maturity in Florida in which we have many schools that are now 40, 50, 60 years old, or more, and need substantial rehabilitation. We are also a State that, every year, is adding some 50,000 to 60,000 new students to our public schools, therefore requiring new schools to be constructed in order to provide the classrooms and laboratories for those additional students, without resorting to overcrowded classrooms. 
I believe that the Federal Government has a role to play in this area, and it will be a role that could be played without undue interference with the responsibilities of State and local officials for the management of public education. I point out, however, that none of those efforts to provide for expanded Federal assistance has been accepted--other than some items through the Tax Code--and there has been a limited benefit to a certain number of school districts. But if we are not going to be providing an aggressive partnership to help States meet what today is over a $200 billion unmet need for school rehabilitation and new school construction, at least we ought to be assisting the States by allowing them to have their own taxes collected by remote sellers. 
According to the New York Times editorial, which was previously referenced, the loophole that exists in today's law that holds that remote sellers are not responsible for collecting State and local sales taxes results in a revenue loss of $3.5 billion today. And that number will rise as more commerce is conducted from remote sales. That $3.5 billion, if the States collect it, could finance a significant beginning of States meeting their school construction needs. 
So as I believe the first principle of the former profession of the occupant of the Chair is to `do no harm,' at least we ought to do no harm to the States by not precluding them from securing the revenue which they would have gotten had those sales been on the north side of Main Street because the decision was made to buy on the south side of Main Street from a remote seller. 
So, Mr. President, this is not only an issue of fundamental fairness, it is an issue of States in this era of devolution of responsibility and Federal reticence to provide assistance to States carrying out their most important responsibilities, such as the education of their children. This will be a step toward our recognizing our responsibilities to our brethren at the State level to be able to fulfill these responsibilities. 
Now, Mr. President, as I conclude, I do so with strong support for the amendment of the Senator from Arkansas. Having offered the same amendment in the Finance Committee and having seen it defeated, and knowing this is not the first time that it has been debated on the Senate floor with the result being defeat, I am not optimistic that the Senate today, regrettably, will adopt the amendment of the Senator from Arkansas. 
We are going to have another debate on a collateral subject, Mr. President. I alert my colleagues to this. It is the debate on whether the commission, which will be established in Senator Wyden's bill, should have the opportunity to consider the issue of the responsibility of remote sellers to collect State and local sales tax. At a minimum, if we are not going to adopt Senator Bumpers' very wise proposal today, we certainly should allow the commission to consider this on another day with even more analysis than we already have, and we will be in a position to do so.

Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, we voted a few minutes ago to invoke cloture on the motion to proceed to the Internet Tax Freedom Act. I opposed that motion to proceed, as did the Senator from Wyoming, Senator Enzi, and a few others. I think it is incumbent upon us to state why we opposed it and why we did not oppose it. 
None of us who opposed the motion to proceed did so because we are antagonistic to high technology. None of us did it because we failed to appreciate the importance of the Internet system and the enormous contribution that it has made in disseminating information to peoples around the world. No one opposed it because we failed to understand the economic importance of this both in terms of the industry itself and how this information industry makes the rest of our economy more efficient and productive. And none of us did it because we are mired in the past, because we have some childhood addiction to the way things have always been. We understand that the world is moving at an increasingly rapid pace and that these technologies are an important engine of that progress. 
But why I believe we did oppose this motion to proceed was to slow down the consideration of a body whose whole purpose for being is to be a deliberative body on issues that are of importance to this Nation and its citizens. 
I believe there has been an effort maybe to minimalize the importance of this legislation, the Internet Freedom Tax Act, and to focus on it almost as a cliche: if you are for high technology you are for this bill. If you are opposed to high technology, you are opposed to this bill. That simplicity hides the real importance of this issue. 
To me, that importance can be described under two labels. The first label, Mr. President, is fundamental fairness. If I were to use an example that I suggested to the Senator from Wyoming, Senator Enzi, earlier today: if Main Street was divided and all the stores on the left side of Main Street were under a requirement to collect sales tax on each of their sales and all the stores on the right side of Main Street were exempt from that obligation to collect tax on exactly the same sales, we would say that is unfair. 
Why should the hardware store on the left side be required to collect sales tax and therefore increase the ultimate cost to its customers of the hammers and saws and nails that were purchased, but the hardware store on the right side be exempt and therefore have that competitive advantage? Everyone would immediately say, `That's unfair. How could you tolerate such a situation?' 
Well, we have essentially that situation today, Mr. President, as it relates to the sales that are made on both sides of Main Street where the sellers are required to collect State and local sales taxes, and remote sellers where you can pick up a catalog and order those same hammers and saws and nails and have them shipped to you by mail where there is no requirement of the seller to collect that sales tax. That creates a discriminatory situation in the marketplace. 
This bill has as a principal objective to avoid discrimination against Internet sales. Now the question is going to be, Discrimination relative to what? To whom? Is it discrimination relative to the Main Street hardware store or is it discrimination relative to the catalog sale hardware store? 
If it is the latter, then the Internet industry would be able to argue, `We shouldn't have to pay any taxes either. We shouldn't have to collect taxes because the sales are made over the Internet any more than our catalog brethren are not required to collect taxes for sales made through the post office or through telephones.' 
If, on the other hand, the question is discrimination against that Main Street hardware store, then the answer is the other way, that `Yes, just as Main Street has to collect, you should have to collect.' 
That issue of fairness then gets to the second issue of its effect on State and local governments. We in this Congress have had as one of our principal objectives to decentralize responsibility, to send more authority from Washington to the communities of America and support that principle. I am a Jeffersonian, and I believe the best government in general is that government which is closest to the people affected by a government's actions. But I understand, as we send more responsibility--whether it is in education or in health care or environmental protection or economic development--to our communities, that they are going to need a revenue base in which to carry out those responsibilities that we have just sent them. 
This issue of discrimination of Internet sales has the potential of driving a major hole into the revenue sources upon which many States and local governments depend in order to provide those very services. The most at-risk service will clearly be education, since it is the largest responsibility of State and local government in terms of its importance to our future and in terms of its use of State and local resources. 
So in my judgment, the most important education bill that we will debate in 1998 will be the Internet Tax Fairness Act because it has the greatest potential of fundamentally affecting what kind of education our children will receive in this and future generations. 
So our reason for slowing this train down was to be able to elevate what I believe to be some very fundamental issues and provide us an opportunity to try to work through them so that we do not inadvertently, in the rush to show our support for high technology, have some very negative unintended consequences. 
The good news, Mr. President, is those efforts have been underway for some time and I believe are close to bearing positive results. In the next couple of days, I anticipate there will be a meeting of many of us who were interested in this issue, from all points of view, to try to close the increasingly narrow gap that is necessary to have legislation that will achieve the desires of the sponsor, which is to give a pause and time and structure for thoughtful consideration of how the Internet transactions should be taxed for purposes of State and local government, as well as international transactions, and to allow the industry this brief period of moratorium from State and local taxes while a comprehensive set of policies is being developed. 
What those of us who have been concerned about the rush to final judgment of this act have been seeking is to assure that that study will look at all of the means by which commerce is being conducted in America today so that we will receive from this moratorium and study a thoughtful set of policies that will not have the effect of eroding concepts of fairness in the marketplace and capacity of State and local governments to carry out their important responsibilities, particularly the education of our children. 
So, Mr. President, those remarks are intended to de-escalate the emotion of this issue, elevate the importance of this to our Nation's future, particularly our future ability to prepare generations of Americans through quality education. And I express my appreciation to Senator Wyden, to Senator Enzi, and to others who have been interested in this and have invested a considerable amount of their time, experience, understanding, and intellect in reaching a resolution that will be in America's interest. I believe we are close, and I look forward to reaching our destination. 
I thank the Chair.

Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I concur with the sense of urgency that our colleague from Massachusetts just presented on this issue. With every day that goes by, another American family is at risk because they do not have these guaranteed protections; another American family is in a quandary because they do not have the kind of information that this would assure. 
The Senator from Massachusetts has spoken in great detail--and the Senator from Rhode Island will shortly do likewise--on this. If I could just focus on two items. The most contentious area between patients and their health maintenance organization is the emergency room. That is where the greatest number of disputes as to the appropriateness of service and responsibility for payment of service occurs. 
Recognizing that fact, last year, this Congress passed a very strong provision for the 35 million Americans who receive their health care financing through Medicare, to protect them relative to their HMO in an emergency room setting. Basically, the standard is, if you are a reasonable lay person and you are suffering from symptoms that a reasonable lay person would feel appropriate for emergency room treatment--say, you have a pain in your left chest--you can go to the emergency room, receive treatment, and not be faced a month later with an enormous bill from that same emergency room because the HMO denied coverage. The HMO is required to provide coverage. 
If you will notice on the chart, I believe it will indicate that both bills--the GOP's and the Democratic--have emergency room access. But that is not the end of the matter. It is not just a matter of getting into the emergency room and having assurance that somebody is going to look at you and determine whether your pain is angina or a heart attack. Then, after that decision is made, there is another critical period. That is what is called the postdiagnostic stabilization period, where something is done to you to bring you back to a level of health that will allow you to return home. 
There is a significant difference, because the Democratic bill provides that that postdiagnostic stabilization period is also guaranteed to be covered. That is not the case with the Republican bill. So you can't just look at a chart with three or four words behind the number and assume that we are talking about parity protections. That is what we ought to be debating. Is there a rational reason to have emergency room access covered, as it is in Medicare, but not to have, as it is in Medicare, the postdiagnostic stabilization covered? We could have a good debate on that issue, and we ought to have that debate. 
Secondly, the issue of informed judgment. Many citizens now have the opportunity to select from a variety of HMOs. They may be with an employer plan that provides multiple HMOs, or if they are purchasing from their own resources from the marketplace, what typically is absent is the means by which even the most concerned and conscientious citizen can make an informed judgment among this variety of plans. 
So we have a provision for information to be made available on the quality of the plan: What kind of things might we anticipate would come from that information about performance outcomes? How many of the patients under one particular plan who, for instance, have a particular type of surgical procedure have a successful outcome? If you are about to have surgery, you would be pretty interested in knowing what the prospects were of your having a positive result. 
Another provision that is likely to be included is information about what will this plan do to help you maintain your state of good health? Will this plan, for instance, provide for screening tests and periodic examinations? Those kinds of things, we know, have the greatest potential of spotting a problem before it becomes a fatal condition, giving you the opportunity to do something to maintain the quality of your health. That provision is in the Democratic plan, but it is not in the Republican plan. I think that is a critical matter for Americans attempting to use their own best efforts to select a plan that will best protect the health of their family. 
So, Mr. President, this is an urgent and critical issue. We are taking up a lot of matters in this last couple of weeks, and I would let the American people make a judgment as to our sense of priorities. Is it more important to be considering the Judicial Vacancies Act during the last 6 or 7 days of this Congress, or to be considering the Bill of Rights for 161 million Americans, in terms of their health care? That is a judgment that the American people should make. I think it is a judgment about which we in the Congress should feel a sense of responsibility to the citizens of this country--to prioritize our efforts on their behalf. 
Mr. President, I am certain we will have more to say on this issue.

Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, fellow Senators. I rise today with my colleague, Senator Mack, to discuss the status of the Kissimmee River Restoration project in the state of Florida. This project is a land acquisition and canal backfilling project. it was authorized by Congress in the Water Resources Development Act of 1992. The state of Florida has spent approximately $95 million in land acquisition and restoration evaluation. The state of Florida has met all of the necessary schedule requirements defined in the Project Cooperation Agreement with the Corps to keep this project on schedule. 
To date, the state's expenditures far exceed the federal contribution--a situation that occurred by design. The state of Florida has front-loaded the land acquisition costs and the federal government is supposed to back-load construction costs.

Mr. GRAHAM. I have been involved in the Kissimmee River project since my days as Governor of the state of Florida. This project is the first step in a long series of individual projects that seek to restore the Florida Everglades to a state as close to their natural state as possible. The results of this backfill contract will be visible to the naked eye. This first contract would backfill 9 miles of the Kissimmee Canal; restoring approximately 16 square miles of restored river/floodplain ecosystem and 17 miles of river channel. Not only will this have important ecological benefits, but it will also make an important contribution to increasing water storage capacity and improving water quality north of Lake Okechobee.

I will briefly state why I think this is such an important piece of legislation. First is fundamental fairness. We have a situation now in which remote commerce--that is, commerce that is not conducted through the traditional retail sales outlet--is effectively exempted from State sales taxes. The same sweater that one would buy at the local department store, subject to local and State sales taxes, is exempt from those taxes, for practical purposes, if it is purchased by a remote sale, either the traditional postal sales or by the newer 
electronic commerce.

Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise in support of the amendment proposed by Mr. Robb of which I am proud to be a cosponsor. 
This amendment addresses an issue of great importance to the State of Florida. Specifically, concern has been expressed about the weakening of the `Perimeter Rule,' and the availability of nonstop flights between smaller airports and Reagan National Airport. I have been in touch with representatives from Jacksonville, Ft. Meyers, West Palm Beach, and Fort Lauderdale. They are convinced that a substantial portion of the direct flights to National that operate out of these airports would eventually be eliminated because the airlines would choose the higher revenue options. A study done by the Washington Airports Task Force supports this opinion. 
The study shows that if the perimeter rule was essentially eliminated or weakened by allowing exemptions, economics will drive the airlines to take that airport's capacity away from markets within the perimeter and re-apply it to the higher value markets outside of the perimeter. That means that as many as 25 cities within the perimeter would be vulnerable to loss of some or all of their nonstop service to National. The study also shows that as many as 1.6 million air travelers in 93 congressional districts could be affected. 
This amendment assures that, for those communities that are served by small and medium hub airports that fall within the perimeter, travel options will not be reduced and consumers will not be subjected to increased travel delays. In addition, this legislation protects the level of service and choices for consumers in the State of Florida and throughout the country. 
I hope that you can support our efforts to ensure that the aviation service in our States are not threatened.

Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, today I rise to discuss the issue of the congressional response, or in this case, the lack of response to the need for additional Federal district court judges. We are facing an increasing disparity between the judicial resources available at many of our Federal district courts and the workload imposed upon those judges. 
The question might be asked, `Why are you offering this amendment to a bankruptcy reform bill?' It is interesting to note that the underlying legislation would create 18 new Federal bankruptcy judgeships. The basis of those 18 new Federal bankruptcy judgeships is that this legislation is created in response to additional workloads requiring that additional number of judges in order to discharge their responsibilities. 
I suggest that, similarly, we should apply the same rationale to our Federal district court judges, and that is--that as their workload increases, either because of demographic or economic or social circumstances, or because we add to their workload by expanding their jurisdiction, it is our commensurate responsibility to increase the number of Federal district judge positions. These judge positions are responsible for handling some of the most complex civil and criminal cases in our judiciary. 
In recognition of that, in March of 1997, the Judicial Conference of the United States, chaired by the Chief Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court, recommended the creation of 24 additional permanent and 12 additional temporary Federal district court positions. The Judicial Conference also recommended the establishment of 12 additional judges to the circuit courts of appeals. However, my remarks this afternoon are confined to the needs that exist with the U.S. district court judges.

Mr. GRAHAM. Absolutely, I say to my friend. I am not proposing that this Congress insert its greater wisdom for that of the Judicial Conference. I am proposing that we accede to the wisdom of the Judicial Conference and where it, for instance, has recommended two additional permanent Federal judgeships in Nevada, that the Congress should sanction them. The reason for the recommendation of two additional judges in Nevada is that, of the 93 districts, including those in the 50 States plus the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico, of that number, the Nevada district ranks eighth in terms of caseload. Its caseload of 736 cases per judge is 171 percent of the stated standard that is used by the Judicial Conference to indicate that new judges are needed.

<TEXT>
Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I appreciate the comments of the Senator from Alabama who, from his long experience in a variety of significant legal positions, is very familiar with the basic principle of my remarks, which is the relationship between changing workload and demand on judicial resources. 
The Judicial Conference has proposed as a method of balancing that workload of judicial resources--a formula. That formula essentially takes the number of cases filed within a particular Federal district, weights those cases based on their complexity, and then divides that number by the number of judges currently assigned to the district. The standard for each Federal district judge is 430 weighted cases per year. When the caseload exceeds 430, that district is entitled to be reviewed for purposes of an additional judge. These judgeships are needed to help the Federal judiciary, a co-equal branch of our Government, to fulfill its constitutional obligations. It should be understood that Congress has not granted the Federal judiciary any additional Article III judges since 1990. 
During the previous three occasions on which Congress has authorized new Federal judgeships under the standards of the Judicial Conference, the cycle for such authorization has been six years. For instance, in September of 1976, the Judicial Conference recommended 106 permanent and 1 temporary Federal district judge. Congress considered that recommendation and, on October 20, 1978, approved 113 permanent and 4 temporary judges. That was done under a Senate which was in Democratic control. 
Mr. President, 6 years later, in September of 1982, the Judicial Conference recommended 43 permanent, 8 temporary, and 2 conversions from temporary to permanent. On July 10, 1984, a Republican Senate authorized 53 permanent, 8 temporary, and 2 temporary to permanent conversions. 
In 1990, June, the Judicial Conference recommended 47 permanent, 29 temporary, and various conversions. 
Then on December 1, 1990, a Democratic Senate approved 61 permanent and 13 temporary and various conversions. 
The point of this is that on a bipartisan basis, whether it was a Republican Senate or a Democratic Senate, every 6 years since 1978, the Congress has responded to the Judicial Conference's recommendation. It is also significant that in each one of those cases, the Congress actually approved more judges than the Judicial Conference had recommended. 
However, the last recommendation that was made was in March of 1997, following recommendations that were unheeded in September of 1992 and in September of 1994. There were recommendations made in March of 1996 to convert a temporary judge to a permanent judge and to convert a temporary extended to a permanent status. But there have been no new judgeships created since December 1, 1990. So we are now 2 years past the point which has been the standard for the creation of new Federal judgeships as recommended by the Judicial Conference. 
Mr. President, I submit that it is high time for us to respond to the need for more U.S. district court judges in accordance with the Judicial Conference's recommendation. Today, many of our district court judges are strained beyond capacity in trying to meet the increasing caseloads which they face. 
For example, in 1997, the Federal judiciary saw increases in both criminal and civil cases. 
The number of cases filed in the district courts increased by 24 percent. 
The most significant increases occurred in drug and immigration cases, particularly, as this chart will indicate, in many of our border States which are the front lines for drug and immigration litigation. 
This growth in Federal caseloads has been coupled with a growing trend by the Congress to federalize an increasing number of laws that have traditionally been considered State responsibilities. These new laws have opened our courts to more cases without the requisite judges to meet the demand. For that reason, it is essential that we take this opportunity to eliminate the disparity between resources and workload in the Federal judiciary by an expansion in the number of judges at the earliest possible time. 
I do not submit my word as being final in this matter. Let me quote the December of 1997 statement by the Chief Justice of the United States Supreme Court and the Chair of the Judicial Conference, The honorable William Rehnquist. This is what the Chief Justice had to say about the current status of our Federal judiciary:  
Fiscal year 1997 saw courts of appeals and bankruptcy filings at the highest rates in history. District courts also were very busy. In addition to a small increase in civil filings, there was a five percent increase in criminal cases in 1997, producing the largest federal criminal caseload in sixty years. 
The Chief Justice went on to say: 
Many factors have produced this upward spiral, including laws enacted by Congress that expand federal jurisdiction over crimes involving drugs and firearms, Supreme Court decisions, large class-action litigation, and changes in executive prosecution policies. 
I think our Chief Justice's statement is a strong message to the Congress, Mr. President. 
If I can illustrate what is happening on a national basis by reference to what is happening in my home State of Florida, I have seen the strain placed on the judiciary due to lack of adequate judicial resources needed to fulfill its constitutional obligations. 
Two of Florida's three districts are feeling the crushing pressure of this strain. These two districts have one of the highest caseloads per judge in the Nation. Under the Judicial Conference recommendation, Florida should receive six additional judgeships that include two additional judges in the southern district of Florida, three permanent judges in the middle district of Florida, and one temporary position in the middle district. 
In the southern district of Florida, the court's weighted filings stand at 590 per judgeship. This is in contrast to the average used by the Judicial Conference of 430. 
In the middle district, the story is even worse. This court's weighted filing is 809 filings per judgeship, which is 88 percent above the acceptable levels the Judicial Conference has established, and is the third highest number in the Nation. 
Mr. President, if I can make reference to this chart which indicates that as recently as 1990, the number of weighted cases in the middle district of Florida were 509 as against a national average of 448. At that time, the middle district was overburdened but not in a crisis situation. 
By 1993, the number had increased to 729, while the national average had dropped to 417. It is significant that there were additional judges added as a result of that December 1990 act of Congress, but it took a full 3 years before the effect of those additional judges had the consequence of reducing the average in the middle district of Florida to 575. No new judges have been added since that period, and currently, at the time of the preparation of this chart, the number was 812 weighted cases per judge in the middle district. I have heard that this figure may have now grown to 855. 
As a result of this, a significant case backlog has developed. Currently, the middle district has 1,200 criminal cases pending and over 6,000 cases pending on the civil side. 
In response to this growing backlog of civil cases, Florida's middle district chief judge, Elizabeth Kovachevich, was forced this summer to declare a state of emergency. She closed the Federal courthouses in Jacksonville and Orlando and reassigned these district judges to work with the Tampa district judges in an aggressive targeting and disposing of the oldest pending civil cases. While such innovative measures may be effective in the short term, Congress will need to find the long-term solution of providing adequate judicial resources. 
This increase in caseload is not only a problem for the Florida courts, but nationally. This chart, again, illustrates the number of States which the Judicial Conference has found additional judicial resources are required. 
The southern district of California is 100 percent above acceptable levels of the Judicial Conference; the district of Arizona, 83 percent above acceptable levels. As our friend and colleague from Alabama has already spoken, the middle district of Alabama is 76 percent over acceptable levels. The western district of North Carolina, 70 percent over acceptable levels. 
The caseload in all of these districts, and all the other districts the Judicial Conference has recommended for additional judgeships, only stand to get worse until Congress acts and acts with a sense of urgency.

Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise to speak on this sense-of-the-Senate resolution with mixed feelings. I would have much preferred to be speaking tonight in behalf of legislation that would have provided for the first time in the 100-year relationship between the United States and Puerto Rico for a congressionally sanctioned plebiscite giving to the people of Puerto Rico the sense of confidence from respect that their voice would be heard as to their desires for their political future. 
Our colleagues in the House of Representatives passed such a plebiscite bill. Unfortunately, after months of hearings, we will not have the opportunity to present from the Energy and Natural Resources Committee to the full Senate such legislation. I commend Senator Murkowski who made a valiant effort to do so, including developing legislation which I think could have been the basis of a consensus on this matter and would have resulted in a favorable vote in the full Senate and the nucleus of a compromise with the House of Representatives. 
But the world goes on. The Governor of Puerto Rico has, with the concurrence of the Puerto Rican Congress, called for a referendum on the political future of Puerto Rico to be held on December 13. It is important that, as a minimal statement of our commitment to the principle of self-determination, we adopt this sense-of-the-Senate resolution and express our position in favor of that plebiscite and indicate that we will take its results with appropriate seriousness. 
We recognize, and the sense-of-the-Senate resolution proclaims, that the ultimate decision as to the political future of Puerto Rico will be made by this Congress, but by giving the degree of recognition to the Puerto Rican-called plebiscite on December 13 that this sense-of-the-Senate resolution will do; it will give additional standing, additional confidence, to the people of Puerto Rico that their vote on that day will have an important impact here as we decide what next steps to take relative to the political future of Puerto Rico. 
Mr. President, it is clear that we cannot continue with the status quo. A decision is going to have to be made, and I believe made soon, as to what the permanent political status of Puerto Rico will be. We have had this expedience throughout America's history. 
After the first 13 colonies, there was the Northwest Ordinance which laid out the basic principle by which future States would be carved out of the large territories of America and joined to the Original States. And that principle included the fact that those new States would join with equal dignity, with equal political rights and responsibilities to the Thirteen Original States. These have been basic tenets of our democracy which now we are called upon to make available to the people of Puerto Rico. 
My colleague, Senator Torricelli, in comments last week made the statement which I think summarizes the essence of the debate that we are having this evening, and that is, that Puerto Rico represents the unfinished business of American democracy. And it cannot be ignored--unfinished business. We need to set about our task of completing that. And that task begins by a respectful listening to the desires of the almost 4 million U.S. citizens who live on the island of Puerto Rico. 
I remind my colleagues that we are not talking about 4 million people who are citizens of a foreign land. Every one of those 4 million people in Puerto Rico is a citizen of the United States of America. These are fellow citizens who have never been afforded the opportunity for a clear congressionally sanctioned expression of their opinion as to what their political future should be. The nearly 4 million U.S. citizens who reside in Puerto Rico are entitled to that opportunity. And this combination of a Puerto Rican congressionally called plebiscite with this degree of sanction by the U.S. Congress is as close as we can reach to that objective in 1998. 
The sense of the Senate is the very least that we can do to honor the request of our fellow U.S. citizens in Puerto Rico and send them a clear message that we are listening to their desires. 
The sense of the Senate, in conjunction with the House-passed bill, takes an important step in the right direction. I thank all of my colleagues who have cosponsored this resolution. I thank all of those who have been so active in the effort to secure a congressionally sanctioned plebiscite in Puerto Rico. 
I say to our fellow citizens in Puerto Rico, we admire your contribution for a century to the development of our land. We admire your patriotism in time of war and your great contributions in time of peace. We extend to you this statement of our respect. 
We urge your full participation in the plebiscite on December 13. We will be anxious to receive your statement of your desires for your political destiny. And then I hope that my colleagues here in this Chamber and our companion Chamber will hear with dignity what you have said and will move towards, with your direction, providing a permanent political status for the U.S. citizens on the island of Puerto Rico. 
Thank you, Mr. President. 
Mr. CRAIG addressed the Chair.

 Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today, along with Senator Grassley, to introduce legislation designed to protect our nation's families hard-earned savings and ensure quality long-term care. 
Our nation has achieved great strides in the 20th century in delivering quality health care and improving the standards of living of its citizens. Just last year Congress added preventive benefits to the Medicare program, thereby ensuring that Americans will have longer, more productive lives. In fact, thanks to these developments life expectancy has increased from 47 years in 1900 to 68 years in 1950, and has steadily increased to 76 years in 1991. These tremendous advances in medicine have also produced challenges because as more and more people live longer, chances increase that they will experience chronic illnesses and disability. 
A three-year stay in a nursing home can cost upwards of $125,000. As a result, nearly half of all nursing home residents who enter as privately-paying patients exhaust their personal savings and lose health insurance coverage during their stay. Medicaid becomes many retirees' last refuge of financial support. 
Another challenge facing America in the future will be the aging of the `baby boomers.' Unfortunately, many `baby boomers' are not planning for the future because they are preoccupied with more immediate concerns. This portion of our population represents more than half of all workers and are the parents of 75% of the nation's children under age 18. Child care, housing expenses and saving for their children's college education tend to dominate their budgets. 
Many Americans mistakenly believe that Medicare will pay for their long-term care needs. `Baby boomers' need to understand the limitations of government programs with regard to long-term care. In reality, this program primarily focuses on hospital stays and physician visits. Without adequate private insurance a significant number of retirees are likely to deplete their assets in order to receive essential long-term care. 
Insurance products are available to ensure that an individual's long-term care needs are met. However, current tax law establishes several obstacles to purchasing long-term care insurance. First, most Americans purchase health insurance through their employer. Over sixty-five percent of 235 million individuals, under age 65, purchase their health insurance through their employer or union. However, tax law prohibits an employer from offering employer subsidized long-term care insurance products through its employee benefits plans. 
Since the enactment of the Kennedy-Kassebaum legislation of 1996, purchasers of qualified long-term care insurance policies are permitted to deduct the premiums as part of their medical expenses. However, for taxpayers other than the self-employed, the tax code restricts the medical expense deduction to the portion of expenses 
exceeding 7.5 percent of their income--a threshold that bars the deduction for 95 percent of non-self employed people. 
Kennedy-Kassebaum also precluded employees from purchasing long term care insurance on a pre-tax basis through their employer. Specifically, the legislation prohibited the inclusion of long-term care insurance in employer-sponsored cafeteria plans and flexible spending accounts. Only if the employer actually pays for the insurance can the employee obtain the coverage on a tax-free basis, but few employers currently are willing to pay for the coverage. The result is that only a small percentage of purchasers of long-term care insurance can obtain the insurance on a pre-tax basis. 
Second, long-term care insurance paid directly by the taxpayer is only deductible if the individual both itemizes his or her deductions and already has deductible medical expenses in excess of 7.5 percent of their adjusted gross income. 
Suppose Mr. and Ms. Jones earn $40,000 per year and want to purchase long-term care insurance. Under current law, health and medical expenses are not deductible unless they exceed 7.5 percent of $40,000, which is $3,000. 
Suppose the premiums for long-term care insurance totaled $1,000. The Joneses would get no tax benefit from the deduction of the premiums unless they already had $2,000 in other qualified medical expenses, and would not get the full benefit of the deduction unless they had $3,000 in other qualified expenses. 
Even if they meet this threshold, the Joneses still will not benefit from the current deduction unless their total itemized deductions--health and non-health--exceed the standard deduction, currently $6,900 for a married couple. 
It becomes clear that the current deduction for log-term care insurance premiums is not providing a very strong incentive to prepare for one's health retirement. A recent survey shows that premium deductibility was cited most frequently as the action that would make non-buyers more interested in long-term care insurance. 
Looking into the future, there are two key goals for retirement security: (1) saving enough money for retirement, and (2) protecting against life's uncertainties, including long-term care costs. An unanticipated nursing home stay can deplete hard-earned savings and threaten a family's financial future. This situation could be especially difficult for the surviving spouse of someone who has had a long-term care stay and depleted all of their retirement savings. The widow or widower can have many years left to live and no remaining retirement assets. 
A recent study by the American Council for Life Insurance indicates that long-term care insurance has the potential to significantly reduce future out-of-pocket and Medicaid expenditures for long-term care. If individuals are covered by long-term care insurance, they are less likely to become Medicaid beneficiaries, thus preserving the individual's savings and decreasing government spending. This would also reinforce Medicaid's intent of serving as a safety net for those who are most needy. 
With the provisions in this legislation, Americans can be more assured of a financially secure retirement.

 Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleague, Senator Grassley, today in introducing legislation that will give many Americans a better chance of financial security in retirement, and make the Federal Government a role model for American companies. 
The issue is long term care insurance. When starting to work on this legislation, several facts seemed most important: 
In 1995 the average cost of nursing home care in the United States was $37,000 per year. In some urban areas of the country, that cost can reach $70,000 per year. Medicare provides short-term care coverage, but the average nursing home stay is two and one-half years. In fact, Medicare paid for only five percent of national nursing home costs. 
Not all long term care occurs in nursing homes--85 percent of nursing home care is nonskilled care. Again, Medicare does not cover nonskilled care, so all of these costs must be covered by the patient and his or her family members. 
Medicaid will provide nursing home and some nonskilled care coverage, but an individual must be extremely low income, or become low income, to qualify for Medicaid. This program currently pays for over half of nursing home expenses in the United States. But who wants to see their lifetime savings, and their children's inheritance, wiped out to pay for the cost of a catastrophic long term illness. 
Unfortunately, many of us will face this circumstance. It is estimated that the majority of women and one-third of men who reach the age of 60 will need nursing home care before the end of their life. Many of the baby boom generation are already facing this issue as they deal with their parents' needs. 
Long term care is one of the most important retirement security issues facing us today. According to a 1997 survey sponsored by the National Council on the Aging, more Americans (69 percent) were worried about how to pay for long term care than were worried about how they would pay for their retirement (56 percent). This level of concern was true for all age groups and income levels among those surveyed. 
Although many companies are considering offering this insurance to their employees, as of 1996 only 13.2 percent of long-term care plans were employer-sponsored. 
Today, Senator Grassley and I are moving the Federal Government into a leadership role by creating a model long term care insurance program for Federal employees. I am very pleased to be working, once again, with Senator Grassley to develop another proposal in our ongoing efforts to improve retirement security for all Americans. 
We are introducing today the Civil Service Long-Term Care Insurance Benefit Act, a companion to the legislation by our colleague in the House, Representative John Mica of Florida. 
We will offer private companies the opportunity to compete to provide long-term care insurance to Federal employees. Our plan will not be at a high cost to taxpayers; premiums will be fully paid by Federal employees--however, by pooling the numbers of workers in the federal government, lower group rates are achieved. 
Only plans qualified under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 may offer this insurance to Federal workers through our legislation, but beyond that, we will let the marketplace determine the cost and services of plans employees may purchase. Flexibility is important in this relatively young industry as insurance companies are still in the process of determining how to most effectively provide this product. Competition among the various carriers, group discounts and volume of sales will keep these premiums affordable. 
Eleven million individuals, including employees and retirees, their spouses, parents, and in-laws would be eligible under our proposal. This bill is just a first step, but an important one. In encourage your support as we continue to improve retirement security, in all of its aspects, for all Americans.

 Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I join the citizens of South Florida in celebrating the distinguished career of Federal Judge C. Clyde Atkins, a man held in the highest esteem by his peers in the community and within the legal profession. 
Born in Washington, D.C., Judge Atkins began his legal career when he attended the University of Florida where his law studies--which he supported by working at campus jobs--earned him a legal degree in 1936. He practiced law in Stuart, Florida before moving to Miami where his distinguished legal performance was highly recognized. He served as President of the Dade County Bar Association from 1953 to 1954, and as President of the Florida Bar Association in 1960. 
In 1966, he was appointed a United States District Judge for the Southern District of Florida, having been nominated by President Lyndon Johnson. He served as Chief Judge from 1977 to 1982, during which time he was appointed by United States Supreme Court Chief Justice Burger as Chairman of the Judicial Conference Committee on Operation of the Jury System. Additionally, President Jimmy Carter appointed him a member of the National Commission for the Review of Antitrust Laws and Procedures, on which he served from 1978 to 1979. In his present position on the federal bench, Judge Atkins has served 32 outstanding years, longer than anyone there presently. 
Integrity and fairness are words synonymous with the characteristics and judicial talents Judge Atkins has exhibited in serving the public. He is particularly credited with ending segregation in Dade County's schools; preserving the rights of the homeless; vigorously upholding the tenets of free speech; and granting the equal treatment of refugees. As an affirmation of his legal acumen, the University of Miami School of Law established the C. Clyde Atkins Moot Court Series, where law students are able to hone their own legal talents. 
A driven and conscientious worker, Judge Atkins has been highly praised by his colleagues and associates, and has garnered the highest respect from within and beyond the legal community. He has been recognized by numerous community organizations, especially the Catholic Church to which he has held a strong and abiding devotion during his lifetime. Judge Atkins has been President of the St. Augustine Diocesan Union of Holy Name Societies and President of the Miami Archdiocesan Council of Catholic Men, as well as receiving the National Conference of Christians and Jews Outstanding Catholic Award. He has been honored by the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith and the Greater Miami Jewish Federation awarded him with the Lifetime Achievement Award. 
Amidst these impressive accomplishments, I believe that Judge Atkins would cite his 61 year marriage to the former Esther Castillo as the most cherished, treasured, and important part of his life. Together, as lifetime partners, they raised three children and have enjoyed the pleasures of grandparenting, as much as my wife Adele and I have. 
Mr. President, I join all those who honor Judge Atkins for his lifetime of commitment to the people of our state. His competence, unswerving integrity and devotion to the bench, his mild and gentle manner, and his consummate respect for the law have given the people of Florida a person who serves as a role model for all to emulate. 
We cherish his service and wish him well as he continues to provide judicial leadership and inspiration to future generations.

 Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, as we approach a new century, we find ourselves in a year of multiple milestones. This year, the world celebrates the 50th anniversary of the founding of the State of Israel, and we also congratulate the pioneering Florida-Israel Institute on its 10-year anniversary. 
The Florida-Israel Institute, created by the Florida Legislature in 1988 to expand ties with Israel, has been a success by any measure: 
Catalyst. Now 23 other states have official links with Israel. Florida set the pace, and its Florida-Israel Institute continues to serve as a model for the rest of the nation. 
Trade boom. Total trade between Florida and Israel tripled between 1987 and 1996, with dramatic increases in exports from Florida to Israel and imports from Israel, according to federal statistics. 
Cultural bridge. The Florida-Israel Institute brings Israel to Florida and Florida to Israel, via the arts, business, academia and research on topics of mutual interest that include agriculture and the environment. 
Examples span the spectrum of the human experience. The Institute brought Israeli jazz pianist Liz Magnes to Florida, and sent Florida professors to Israel and Jordan. It helped sponsor the one-woman show `Nomi' at the University of Central Florida, and sent Florida business leaders to Israel. 
A premier feature of the Florida-Israel Institute is scholarship. The Institute carries out the time-honored precept that knowledge is a key to human understanding and a powerful weapon against fear and hate. 
The Florida-Israel Institute just awarded scholarships to 57 Israeli students for the 1998-99 academic year. These students will study on campuses throughout Florida, enriching campus life for all and then serving as ambassadors for life, linking Florida and Israel. The Institute--co-hosted by Florida Atlantic University and Broward Community College--has strong roots in education. 
As a repeat visitor to the Middle East, I know there is no substitute for first-hand experience in understanding the challenges facing Israel. My wife, Adele, and I were honored to return to Israel this year to help celebrate the 50th anniversary. 
Likewise, the Florida academics, entrepreneurs and civic leaders who visit Israel--thanks to the Florida-Israel Institute--bring back a keener understanding and a deeper appreciation of our special relationship with our ally State, Israel. 
On this special 10-year milestone, I call on my colleagues to join me in saluting the founders, managers and advisory board of this exemplary public-private partnership: the Florida-Israel Institute.

Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, today I rise to honor Hispanic Americans. 
National Hispanic Heritage Month is celebrated every year from September 15 to October 15. 
This month-long observation, established in 1968, is now a celebration of the history and achievements of Hispanic Americans. 
During the August recess, among the many visits I made throughout my state, I had the opportunity to once again visit the historic city of St. Augustine. 
A visit to St. Augustine is always very special but this time it was more so because accompanying me on this trip were my triplet granddaughters. I took advantage of this occasion to teach my granddaughters about the rich and wonderful history of St. Augustine, of Florida and of our Nation. 
And they taught me something about the thrill of seeing castles and historic sites for the first time through the fresh eyes of a 3-year old. 
Hispanic presence in what is now the United States began long before our Nation existed. 
In 1513, Juan Ponce de Leon sailed from Puerto Rico to the east coast of Florida.

 Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, as we approach a new century, I recognize one of the giants of the 20th century: Dr. William Foster, Chairman of the Music Department and Director of Bands at Florida A&M University in Tallahassee, Florida. 
After enriching the lives of thousands of students, and entertaining millions around the globe via superlative performances of The Marching 100 band, Dr. Foster is retiring. A special tribute will be held honoring him in Tallahassee on September 4, 1998. 
Dr. Foster's service to Florida A&M University and the field of music spans half a century. His genius was in melding the varied sounds of musical instruments--along with unique choreography--into one of the most celebrated and sought-after marching bands in the world. 
With each performance, The Marching 100 band proves the axiom that music is an international language. And its director, Dr. Foster, is music's Ambassador at Large, lifting the spirits of all who heard the glorious sounds of this talented group and saw the high-stepping moves that set this band apart from all others. 
Mr. President, this is the time of year that we send our children and grandchildren back to school to begin another academic year. As a nation, we focus on the vital role of education. 
Dr. Foster personifies the finest attributes of an educator. He passed on knowledge to thousands, he built teamwork and instilled discipline, and he had fun along the way. 
The educational leadership of Dr. Foster is one of the reasons why Florida A&M University is ranked among America's leading institutions of higher learning. Last year, Florida A&M University was cited as `College of the Year' by editors of TIME magazine and The Princeton Review. 
Mr. President, I have been honored to visit Florida A&M University on many occasions. I have experienced the spirit on campus, in the classrooms and among the greater Florida A&M University family of alumni, faculty, administrators, and students. 
And, I have experienced the special joy of watching and listening to The Marching 100 under the direction of Dr. Foster. I call on my colleagues in the Senate--and all those who love music--to join me in this tribute to an outstanding American, a gifted educator and band director without peer: Dr. William Foster.

 Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, teachers, students, parents, and school administrators know that the United States faces a school infrastructure crisis. Many of our schools are more than 50 years old and crumbling, and the General Accounting Office estimates that it will cost about $112 billion to bring them into good repair. Moreover, this estimate does not take into account the need for new construction. The U.S. Department of Education projects that some 1.9 million more students will be entering schools in the next 10 years. At current prices, it will cost about $73 billion to build the new schools needed to educate this growing student population. Mr. President, I might add that my own State is gaining 60,000 new students each year. By the end of the decade, Florida's student enrollment will have increased 25 percent more than the population as a whole. 
Education is rightfully a state and local matter, but the Federal government can play a helpful, non-intrusive role in assisting communities overwhelmed by explosive increases in student enrollment. We at the Federal level should help empower local school districts to find innovative, cost effective ways to finance new schools and repair aging ones. Let me quote Mr. Roger Cuevas, who is the superintendent of schools for Miami-Dade County, FL: 
It is important that financing options be defined in as flexible a manner as possible and especially not be limited to general obligation bonds . . . Flexibility in the choice of the type of eligible debt financing, as well as the capacity of the program to adapt to state-by-state differences are as critical to all school districts in the Nation as is its funding level. 
The bill I am introducing today providing new flexibility to state and local efforts to finance new schools and repair older ones. The first provision provides for public school construction the same financing opportunities which are currently available in a wide variety of other public-need areas namely, airports, seaports, mass transit facilities, water and sewer facilities, solid waste, disposal facilities, qualified residential rental projects, local furnishing of electric energy and gas, heating and cooling facilities, qualified hazardous waste facilities, high-speed inter-city rail facilities and environmental enhancements, of hydroelectric generating facilities. In all of these 10 separate areas, the U.S. Congress has provided assistance in the financing through what is known as private activity bonds. 
This bill adds public schools in this list. Mr. President, this legislation was part of Senator Coverdell's A Plus Savings Account bill that was passed by the Senate earlier this session. Unfortunately, this important provision was eliminated by a House-Senate Conference Committee. Mr. President, we now have another chance to do something constructive for our public schools. A recent article in the Washington Post reported that education is one of the American people's highest priorities. It should be one of our highest priorities too. 
This legislation provides to each state the opportunity to issue tax-exempt private activity bonds to finance construction of public schools. These bonds would be administered at the state level, just as are the other 10 categories of private activity bonds. States containing school districts experiencing high growth would be allowed to issue bonds each year in an amount equal to $10 multiplied by the population of the state. For example, if a state with high-growth school districts has a population of 5 million, it could issue up to $50 million of bonds to finance school construction. A high-growth school district is one with an enrollment of at least 5,000 students and the enrollment has grown by at least 20 percent during the five years previous to the year of bond issue. According to the U.S. Department of Education, 286 school districts located throughout the Nation currently meet high-growth qualifications. 
This proposal puts decisionmaking at the local level. Each state would decide how to allocate its bonding authority among its high-growth school districts. The state or local education authority would enter into an agreement--with the most favorable terms it could negotiate--with a private corporation to build schools. The state would issue the bonds, but the private corporation would be responsible for servicing the debt on the bonds. The state or local education authority would then lease back the facility. Ownership of the facility would revert to the state or local education authority upon retirement of the bonds. 
There are multiple benefits to permitting states and local school districts to enter into partnerships with private corporations to build schools. First, this mechanism can reduce construction time. For example, it would take a school district issuing $4 million of general obligation bonds each year, using the traditional `pay-as-you-go' approach, about 11 years to finance the construction of three typical schools. The lease back mechanism permitted through the use of private activity bonds could result in building three schools within three years of issuing the bonds. Perhaps just as important, this arrangement would permit the use of facilities for other worthwhile purposes when school is not in session. 
The other component to this legislation provides relief to small or rural school districts issuing bonds for school construction. Under current law, issuers of school construction bonds worth less than $10 million are exempt from the arbitrage rebate rules. This bill raises that exemption to $15 million, providing relief from burdensome Federal regulations to even more school districts. 
Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support these modest proposals to provide some much needed assistance to our public schools.

Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today together with my friends and distinguished colleague, Senator Mack, to introduce legislation to name five United States Post Offices in Miami-Dade County, Florida after five prominent civic and community leaders. By doing so, we are joining the entire Florida delegation in the United States House of Representatives in honoring these individuals of great importance to our state. 
This legislation honors these five individuals service, commitment, and dedication to their communities. Athalie Range is a multi-faceted local community leader and humanitarian Garth Reeves, Sr. is a publisher, banker, and entrepreneur. William R. `Billy' Rolle was a teacher, coach, and community education leader. Essie Silva was a leader and proponent of business development for South Florida's Africa-American community. Helen Miller was the first African-American female Mayor in Dade County, Florida. 
While these five individuals come from different backgrounds and professions they have one similar quality: dedication to their communities. Through their service, they have made immeasurable contributions to South Florida and our entire state. Mr. President, let me say a few words about each of these outstanding individuals: 
 Athalie Range has been a leader in South Florida for over 30 years. She was the first African-American and second woman to be elected to the Miami City Commission. Governor Reubin Askew appointed her the first African-American department head in the state of Florida. Ms. Range has also been the recipient of over 160 awards and honors. I have had the pleasure of knowing and learning from Ms. Range for many years. Her commitment to improving the quality of life for all citizens has been constant and meaningful. 
Garth Reeves has been committed to excellence and achievement in South Florida for over 50 years. As the owner and publisher of the Miami Times, he has covered many of the important news stories of the last half-century. He has also been an exemplary civic leader who served on the Boards of Trustees of Miami-Dade Community College, Barry University, Bethune-Cookman College, and Florida Memorial College. 
Essie D. Silva was a proponent of South Florida economic development her whole life. She chaired the Government Affairs Department of the Miami-Dade Chamber of Commerce and led groups to lobby in Tallahassee and Washington. In addition to her business activities, Ms. Silva was instrumental in establishing the Sunstreet Carnival, a popular family festival held in Miami. 
Helen Miller became the first African-American female Mayor elected in Miami-Dade County when Opa Locka residents chose her as their Mayor in 1982. She has served on over forty different community boards dedicated to improving the quality of life in South Florida. She was a woman of tremendous vigor and leadership who was recognized as the elder stateswoman of Opa Locka, Florida. She passed away on October 2, 1996, in Opa Locka, Florida. 
William R. `Billy' Rolle dedicated his life in one of our most important professions--teaching. He spent over thirty five years as a teacher, coach, band instructor, and assistant principal. In all these different roles he continued to inspire young people to reach their full potential. Also, Mr. Rolle helped organize the First Annual Goombay Festival, a popular Caribbean event held in Miami. He passed away on January 20, 1998, in Miami, Florida. 
Mr. President, the accomplishments of these five individuals are worthy of having a post office designation. All of these post offices that will bear the names of the individuals will be located in the communities where they lived. It is appropriate that we grant this honor to salute their life long commitment to their community. I urge all my colleagues to join Senator Mack and me in supporting this important legislation.

 Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, today, along with Senators Moynihan and D'Amato, I introduce the Medicaid Children's Health Improvement Amendments of 1998. This legislation, which was introduced in the House of Representatives last week, would attempt to correct a situation currently jeopardizing the health of many of the children living in our territories. 
Last year Congress passed what was the single largest investment in health care for children since the passage of Medicaid in 1965.' As a result, the United States will invest an additional $24 billion in children's health care over the next five years. However, not all of our nation's poor children are celebrating this victory. 
In the negotiations over the budget reconciliation, the initial proposal providing 1.5 percent of the funding to our nation's territories, which represented a fair distribution, was reduced to a mere 0.25 percent. The children's health care program ultimately included in the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 provides Puerto Rico with approximately 0.22 percent of the overall national funding for the program and 0.03 percent for Guam, the U.S. Virgin Islands, American Samoa and the Northern Mariana Islands. For Puerto Rico alone this would mean less than $11 million per year for a jurisdiction with close to four million U.S. citizens. 
It is absolutely outrageous that the United States would continue to endorse a discriminatory policy that denies equal health care to the children of its territories. If this legislation was enacted most of Guam's 5,000 uninsured children would finally receive the coverage that they rightfully deserve. It would also approximately multiply the number of children covered in the U.S. Virgin Islands by six. 
In addition to providing additional funding for the children's health insurance program in our territories, this legislation includes a provision that would grant states the option to provide health care coverage to legal immigrant children who entered the United States on or after August 22, 1996. Welfare reform prohibits states from covering these immigrant children. 
As we know, children without health insurance do not get important care for preventable diseases. Many uninsured children are hospitalized for acute asthma attacks that could have been prevented, or suffer from permanent hearing loss from untreated ear infections. Without adequate health care, common illnesses can turn into life-long crippling diseases, whereas appropriate treatment and care can help children with diseases like diabetes live relatively normal lives. A lack of adequate medical care will also hinder the social and educational development of children, as children who are sick and left untreated are less able to learn. 
I hope that with the help of my colleagues in Congress we will be able to rectify the discrimination against the children of our territories and afford them the same treatment as the other children in the nation. They deserve no less. Programs created to protect our nation's children should represent the highest and most pure ideals of our society.

 Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I want to commend Senator Chafee, Senator Lieberman, Senator Specter, and Senator Baucus for your outstanding leadership on an issue of vital importance to the country--protecting patients from abuses by managed care organizations. 
Mr. President, what looms before the Senate is ominous. If nothing changes, when we return in September, we appear destined to be witnesses to the Senate's version of a massive train wreck in the form of managed care debate. 
The Republican train and the Democratic train are racing toward each other with ever-increasing speed and hostility, neither side willing to apply the brakes and switch tracks--neither side mindful of the havoc the wreck could cause. 
If we don't switch tracks, the wreck is inevitable. And the casualties will not be either political party. Instead, they will be the American public, who have asked us to provide them with basic federal protections. 
My colleagues and I are simply not willing to sacrifice the opportunity to pass meaningful managed care reform this year for the opportunity to score political points. 
Over the past few years, it has become increasingly clear that the American people are anxious about their health security as a consequence of managed care. Even managed care plans are nervous about the possibility of declining enrollment due to an increasing lack of consumer confidence. 
Our bill seeks to leave the decision-making to doctors and their patients, and to ensure that patients get what they are paying for with their hard-earned dollars. 
Our goal is to hold insurance companies accountable for the benefits and services they claim to be delivering. Patients want the right to see a specialist when they need one; our bill assures that. Patients want assurances they will get the medicines their doctors say they need, not just what's on a plan's formulary; our bill assures that. Patients want to know that plans are not providing financial incentives to their doctors to withhold medically necessary treatment; our bill assures that. Parents want to know that a pediatrician is available to serve as their child's primary care provider; our bill assures that. 
Women want to know that they can see their ob/gyn without first getting permission from the plan's gatekeeper; our plan assures that. 
However, having said all of that, it is vitally important to look at the fine print when comparing the patient protections contained in each of these proposals because, as the saying goes, the Devil is in the details. 
For example, all of the plans would require insurers to pay for emergency services. However, the GOP plan lacks a critical protection which was enacted into law for Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries as part of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997--reimbursement for post-stabilization care. 
Each bill contains an external appeals process to allow patients to appeal denials or limitations of care to an independent entity. However, the Republican proposal would prevent any complaint for a service valued at less than $1,000.00 from being referred to an external appeals body. Picture the situation where a woman is denied a mammogram which, had it been done, would have resulted in early detection of breast cancer and you begin to understand why this provision is problematic. 
In closing while the idea of playing the blame game up to the fall elections might be appealing to some, we are asking our colleagues, through this legislation, to take another course of action--to pass meaningful and effective patient protections for 161 million Americans this year.

Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I would like to agree and emphasize the remarks of my colleague. Unfortunately, there has been a debate over the status of these emitters which are presently at Eglin Air Force Base. Some believe the Base Closure and Realignment process mandated the relocation of these emitters. However, the BRAC also insisted that training requirements must be met. I believe these emitters should remain at Eglin to meet the warfighters training requirements until we can resolve this dispute. I believe this would be consistent with the BRAC direction.

Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, thank you for the opportunity to address the Senate on the passage of the `Commercial Space Act,' introduced by Senator Mack and myself in November 1997. 
I am pleased this bill has passed today because it is critical in allowing United States launch companies to compete effectively in the growing commercial space race. 
Having already passed the House by a large margin, the Commercial Space Act needed to be considered by the Senate. I was pleased to work with my colleagues to ensure the future of our nation's high-tech economic frontier: commercial space. 
I speak to you today as a Senator concerned about both our national security and our nation's economic position. The United States cannot afford to descend into another `launch gap.' Our recent discussions over why U.S. satellites are being launched from China demands that the U.S. Senate act quickly to make the commercial launch environment in this country as progressive and productive as possible. 
When the space race began with the launch of Sputnik in October 1957, American citizens listened in indignation and fear as the first man-made satellite--a Soviet satellite--beeped its way around the earth. In the two decades that followed, an aggressive U.S. space program, both civil and military, brought our country back to its rightful lead in technology by putting a man on the moon and securing many other achievements in space. 
But there is no denying that today, the United States preeminence in commercial space is threatened. If you were to step back in time 30 years to the nation's premier launch facility, Cape Canaveral, you would have seen a forest of launch vehicles ready on the pads. Visit our launch facilities today and you will see under-utilized launch facilities while at the same time U.S. commercial companies struggle to develop new space vehicles under constraints of outdated laws and policies. 
A recent aerospace survey predicts over 2,000 satellites will be launched into earth orbit over the next decade. The good news is that the U.S. government and American companies may launch up to 65 percent of those payloads if the Commercial Space Act is implemented. The bad news is that many commercial satellite companies are already looking to foreign countries for launch services due to the restrictive environment in which they must operate in the United States and the lack of available launch vehicles. 
In other words, Mr. President, while our space industry is rapidly preparing for the 21st Century, federal policy in dealing with this important source of economic activity is stuck on the launch pad. 
The single most important provision of the Commercial Space Act is an amendment to the Commercial Space Launch Act of 1984 that gives the federal government the authority to license commercial space re-entry activities. In short: what goes up, must come down. 
Can you imagine the Wright Brothers flight at Kitty Hawk ever being made if the government told them, `Sure you can fly it, just don't land.' The way the law presently exists, commercial companies can launch but cannot land any vehicle returning from space. Only the U.S. government is allowed this privilege. 
This provision must be changed to allow the development of future generations of spacecraft, such as the Reusable Launch Vehicle. This is the business of space: providing services, repeat services, to entrepreneurs. We must regulate in an efficient and expeditious manner to support this growing market. 
That brings me to my next point: this bill, to borrow from Neil Armstrong, will take a giant leap in clarifying complex and sometimes divergent commercial space licensing requirements in federal agencies. By streamlining the regulations and licensing, we will allow commercial companies to raise capital, develop business plans, and create job opportunities that might otherwise go overseas. 
Mr. President, U.S. commercial space industry faces a number of competitors from abroad. The most serious are the Russian Proton, the Chinese Long March, and the European Space Agency Ariane rockets launched from French Guiana in South America. But this is not a comprehensive list. There are numerous competitors who would be more than happy to see the U.S. commercial launch industry locked in a web of regulations and limitations. 
I am proud to report that one thing our bill does not do is spend any new taxpayer dollars. As a policy bill, we are seeking to level the playing field without creating any new government programs. Our bill does require studies, but those studies will be accomplished using the existing resources of agencies involved and data that has already been collected. 
For instance, our legislation would require the Department of Defense to conduct an inventory of its range assets and determine what, if any, deficiencies exist. Much of this information is already available through existing Defense Department reports. Armed with this information, we can convert our nation's launch ranges back to the busiest space facilities in the world. 
But this legislation does more than just refrain from new spending. It actually saves money by allowing the conversion of excess ballistic missiles into space transportation vehicles. Due to the START treaty, these missiles can no longer be used for their original intended purpose. Furthermore, they are extremely expensive to store or destroy. 
By using these missiles as launch vehicles, the government will be able to launch small scientific and educational payloads that cannot afford the larger and more expensive rocket systems. This is a legal and efficient way to dispose of an expensive asset. Our Russian counterparts have been firing their missiles as opposed to spending money to destroy them. We will implement one more practical step by firing them with a payload. 
In closing, let me remind you of remarks that President John F. Kennedy made in the midst of the hotly contested space race. During one of his visits to Cape Canaveral, President Kennedy declared, `We choose to go the moon in this decade and do the other things, not because they are easy, but because they are hard.' 
As we consider this bill, we should all ponder that quote. It is not easy for the federal government to change the way it has done business for many years. It is hard; it is a challenge, for forward-thinking people both in and out of the government. But it is what we must do to protect our investment in the nation's economic future and our national pride. It is vital that we ensure our nation's position in the commercial space race of the 21st century. 
I thank the distinguished Chairman and Ranking Member of the Senate Commerce Committee Senator McCain and Senator Hollings, and the Chairman of the Science, Technology, and Space Subcommittee Senator Frist for supporting this legislation and guiding it through the Senate process.

 Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, today I submit a resolution that designated October 11, 1998 as National Children's Day. 
Our children are our future. Over 5 million children, however, go hungry at some point each month. There has been a 60 percent increase in the number of children needing foster care in the last 10 years. Many children today face crises of grave proportions, especially as they enter their adolescent years. 
The establishment of a National Children's Day would help us focus on our children's needs and recognize their accomplishments. It would encourage families to spend more quality time together and highlight the special importance of the child in the family unit. 
It is important that we show our support for the youth of America. This simple resolution will foster family togetherness and ensure that our children receive the attention they deserve. 
I urge my colleagues to join me in establishing National Children's Day.

Mr. GRAHAM. Madam President, I rise today to offer an amendment to the Treasury-Postal appropriations bill that will bring justice to thousands of Haitian nationals who fought for democracy and freedom against the greatest odds. 
Last November, Congress passed the Nicaraguan Adjustment and Central American Relief Act to protect those who fled Communism and oppression in Central America during the 1980s. 
But while that legislation was a monumental step forward for fairness, it left one deserving group completely unprotected. 
Just as brave Central Americans resisted tyranny in their native countries, Haitians struggled to free themselves from oppression. 
In fact, many Haitians seeking asylum in our country are here because they challenged a regime that was wantonly violating basic human freedoms. 
Mr. President, these brave Haitians have suffered greatly for the causes of freedom and democracy. 
They should not be forced to endure serious disruptions in their life once again. 
Even though conditions in Haiti have improved greatly since 1994, Amnesty International reports that human rights abuses still occur. 
As people who contribute mightily to the strength of our communities, the Haitians living in the United States should not be forced to risk returning to the scene of their prior persecution . . . to face the possibility that it might happen again. 
This amendment is a bipartisan effort. Senators Mack and I--along with the cosponsors of the bill I introduced last year, Senators Kennedy, Abraham, Moseley-Braun, D'Amato, Moynihan, Feinstein, Kerry of Massachusetts, Durbin, and Lautenberg--have joined together to ensure that the Haitian people who have sought fairness and justice for so long receive it in 1998. 
We have the bipartisan support of leaders ranging from President Clinton to Republicans like Jack Kemp and my Florida colleagues Ileana Ros-Lehtinen and Lincoln Diaz Balart. 
Mr. President, we have left no stone unturned in crafting this legislation. We've asked for input from all sources. 
Senator Abraham held a hearing on this bill in December of 1997. The bill was marked up and passed out of the Senate Judiciary Committee on April 23, 1998. 
I have personally met with Senator Lott and explained the importance of this legislation to my state of Florida. 
Now we ask our Senate colleagues to take action. The 40,000 Haitian nationals in the United States face deportation in December if Congress does not act. 
Our nation was built as a bastion of freedom and a haven for those fleeing oppression around the world. We embrace that heritage in this legislation. 
Specifically, our bill helps three groups of individuals--a total of 40,000--adjust their status to legal residency. 
Those who were paroled into the United States from Guantanamo Bay, after careful screening by immigration personnel. 
These individuals were flow to the United States for review because their asylum cases were deemed to be valid and credible. 
Our bill also helps those who were not paroled from Guantanamo, but who came to our nation and filed an application for asylum before December of 1995. 
Finally, it reaches out to a small group of unaccompanied or orphaned Haitian children. 
The members of each of these three groups are legally here in our country. 
They have followed all the laws of our land. This legislation will give them the chance to continue working here. It will help them as they build small businesses. It will keep their U.S. citizen children in school. 
Most importantly, it will keep their vibrant spirit and determined work ethic alive in our cities and communities. 
During our field hearing, I saw the problem that Haitians face through the eyes of a bright, young student. She couldn't come to the hearing because she was working at one of the two jobs she holds to pay her community college tuition. Alexandra Charles is eighteen years old. 
She is an orphan who came to the United States when she was ten years old--after her mother was brutally murdered by Haitian military officials. 
She has over a dozen relatives in the United States who are legal residents, but who are not closely related enough to be sponsors. 
She has virtually no relatives left alive in Haiti. 
Like many individuals in similar circumstances, Ms. Charles was granted a suspension of deportation. 
But this relief was withdrawn after the Board of Immigration Appeals ruled that the 1996 immigration law retroactively affected cases like hers. 
Alexandra's future in the United States looks bright. 
She is a hard worker and a model student. 
But without this legislation, our nation will lose the benefit of her special skills and her dedication to our community. 
Alexandra is just one of the thousands of law-abiding, hard working individuals who will not be allowed to pursue their valid asylum claims due to the retroactive nature of our 1996 immigration law. 
I ask for your help in this fight for justice and fairness. 
Let us prove once again that our nation values those who put their lives on the line in the struggle for freedom and democracy.

Our democracy depends upon a very special relationship between the people and those who are fortunate enough to be their representatives. We must not break that bond. We must be prudent in our actions, but not closed in our demeanor toward the thousands of citizens who come here on a daily basis to observe their democracy.

Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, 100 years ago this past Saturday--July 25, 1898--U.S. Major General Nelson Miles and his troops arrived on Puerto Rico's shores to liberate the island from tyranny. On that historic occasion, he declared that the United States came `bearing the banner of freedom . . . the fostering arm of a nation of free people, whose greatest power is in justice and humanity to all those living within its fold.' 
One hundred years after those valiant actions and eloquent words, the nearly four million people of Puerto Rico--excuse me, the United States citizens of Puerto Rico--continue to wait for the fulfillment of that promise of justice and humanity. For the last century, they have been denied the most fundamental right of a free people: the right to choose their own political destiny. 
Mr. President, enough is enough. In the last 100 years, Puerto Ricans have fought for freedom as part of the U.S. armed forces. Through their vibrant culture and tireless spirit, they have made invaluable and lasting contributions to American democracy. But they have never had a real opportunity to exercise that freedom fully or enjoy the complete benefits of living in that democracy. Congress must right that wrong in 1998. 
Make no mistake: Puerto Ricans are ready for this opportunity. In its quest to gain the right of political self-determination, Puerto Rico has on three occasions held local plebiscites to express preferences for the political options of statehood, independence, or commonwealth. But since these votes were not sanctioned by Congress, they had little more than symbolic value. 
In 1997 and 1998, the Puerto Rican Legislature passed resolutions asking Congress to provide Puerto Ricans with a real opportunity to determine their political future. But our loudest action on this request has been inaction. 
It is high time that we move forward. The 105th Congress--and others before it--has held numerous hearings. The House of Representatives passed its version of Puerto Rico status legislation more than four months ago. The Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee has thoroughly examined the many issues surrounding Puerto Rico's self-determination. We are fully educated. The only work that remains to be done are a committee mark-up and vote, Senate floor action, and a House-Senate Conference Committee. 
Congressman Carlos Romero-Barcelo, Puerto Rico's non-voting member of Congress, told the Energy and Natural Resources Committee that  
The unresolved dilemma of Puerto Rico's status is the single most important long term issue of concern to all Puerto Ricans. It permeates every aspect of our political and economic life and holds our future hostage. 
Mr. President, the United States does not hold innocent hostages. It frees them, just as it did 100 years ago when General Miles and his troops waded ashore in Puerto Rico to rescue the residents of that beautiful island from tyranny. 
In 1998, as the United States and Puerto Rico celebrate 100 years together, the U.S. Senate can decide to act as our colleagues in the House of Representatives have already done. I urge my colleagues not to make that decision by indecision. The 3.8 million United States citizens in Puerto Rico are counting on us to give new life to their long-frustrated dream of political self-determination. We must not let them down. One hundred years is far too long to wait.

 Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, today along with my distinguished colleague from Oklahoma, Senator Inhofe, I introduce the Disaster Mitigation Act of 1998, legislation that will refocus the energies of federal, state and local governments on disaster mitigation, and will shift our efforts to preventative--rather than responsive--actions as we ready the nation for future disasters. 
Since the outset of this year, I have been working closely with Senator Inhofe to develop this bi-partisan legislation that will more comprehensively and efficiently address the threats we face from disasters of all types. The bill is composed of two titles: Title I seeks to reduce the impact of disasters by authorizing a `pre-disaster mitigation' program; Title II seeks to streamline the current disaster assistance programs to save administrative costs in addition to greatly simplifying these programs for the benefit of states, local communities, and individual disaster victims. 
In addressing the challenges we face from the threat of disaster, I have found it very helpful to use a `doctor/patient' analogy to guide our efforts. First, we diagnosed the problem: over the last ten years, disasters have affected the nation with more frequency--and at a greater cost--than we have experienced in the past. In fact, over the last several years, the supplemental appropriations bills required to respond to disasters have been unusually large compared to the previous decade due to a series of unprecedented disasters including: Hurricanes Andrew and Iniki in 1992; the Midwest floods of 1993; the Northridge earthquake of 1994; and the Upper Midwest floods of 1997. 
Second, we offered a prescription to address the problem: comprehensive pre-disaster mitigation. This bill will authorize a five-year pre-disaster mitigation program, funded at $35 million per year, to be administered by Federal Emergency Management Agency, or FEMA. The pre-disaster mitigation program will change the focus of our efforts, at all levels of government, to preventative--rather than responsive--actions in planning for disasters. Such a change in ideology is critical to reducing the short- and long-term costs of natural disasters. It will encourage both the public and the private sector, as well as individual citizens, to take responsibility for the threats they face by adopting the concept of disaster mitigation into their everyday lives. Just like energy conservation, recycling, and the widespread use of seat belts, disaster mitigation should become a concept that all citizens incorporate into their day-to-day lives. 
Since 1993, under the leadership of Director James Lee Witt, FEMA has truly changed their way of doing business. In the past five years, FEMA has become more responsive to disaster victims and state and local governments, and has `reinvented' itself by choosing to focus its energy on mitigating, preparing for, responding to, and recovering from the effects of natural hazards. FEMA has already taken an important first step in advocating pre-disaster mitigation by establishing `Project Impact,' their new mitigation initiative, in local communities throughout the nation. I am proud to say that Deerfield Beach, Florida, was the first community to be chosen as a participant in Project Impact. By authorizing the conduct of Project Impact for five years in the legislation, we are making a definitive endorsement of both the program and Director Witt's leadership, and we expect that the initiative will produce measurable results in reducing the costs of disaster in the future. 
Mr. President, this legislation is the result of coordination and cooperation with FEMA, the National Association of Emergency Management, the National League of Cities, representatives of the private and voluntary sectors, and numerous other state and local governmental organizations. I wish to take this opportunity to thank all who provided important input into the development of this bill, and I am confident that our joint efforts have resulted in a truly comprehensive `diagnosis' of the problem, as well as a `prescription' to address it. 
In his testimony before the Environment and Public Works Committee, Florida Director of Emergency Management Joe Myers called this legislation a `defining moment' in emergency management. I too believe that this legislation represents a historic change in the nation's efforts to prevent the effects of natural disasters. By taking proactive steps to implement mitigation now, we will reduce the damage, pain, and suffering from disaster that have become all too familiar. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support Senator Inhofe and myself by joining with us in our efforts to protect the citizens of the U.S. from disasters now and in the future.

Mr. GRAHAM. Thank you, Mr. President. 
Mr. President, the current system is broken. Let me just give a few examples of that collapse. According to the General Accounting Office report issued the end of 1997, there were 600,000 illegal agricultural workers in the United States--600,000. In my State of Florida, a major agricultural production State, in 1997 the number of H-2A visas, the visas that would create a legal status for an alien agricultural worker, were four; not 400 or 4,000, but four. 
Third, the American worker is disadvantaged under the current system. As an example, if an American agricultural worker is employed by an American farmer, the American farmer must pay Social Security and other employment taxes on the wages earned by that American farm worker. But if the American farmer employs a non-U.S. farm worker, those taxes do not have to be collected 
and, thus, there is an incentive to employ the foreign worker before employing the American worker. 
Farmers are in a sea of complexity. There is a process under the current law in which a farmer can make an application for an H-2A worker. Supposedly, that application is to be processed within 20 days. In 1996, more than one-third of the applications failed to meet that 20-day processing period, and so the farmer was not able to get a signal as to whether his request for legal foreign workers would be met. 
This fails the foreign worker. It fails the foreign workers by forcing most of them into an illegal status where they lack the respect and protection that a legal program would provide. 
If I could give one example: In August of 1992, after Hurricane Andrew hit south Dade County, FL--a major agricultural production area--there was concern about a public health epidemic and therefore there was the desire to have people immunized against a variety of potential diseases. 
The public health officials found it extremely difficult to get the agricultural workers to come forward to be immunized for their own protection and the protection of the general public because they knew they were illegal and were afraid that, by presenting themselves for an immunization shot, they would be making themselves subject to deportation. That is the kind of fear and terror in which we have over 600,000 human beings in the United States, who are harvesting our food, live on a daily basis. 
Finally, the current system fails the American consumer. We have the opportunity in this country and have had historically access to the best food produced under the most sanitary conditions and the most affordable food in the world. But if we have many more instances, as the Senator from Idaho talked about occurred recently in Georgia, where a major crop rots on the field because of the inability to secure a legal workforce, we will be denying the American consumer what we have traditionally assumed is an American birthright. 
Mr. President, the current system is broken. The Senator from Oregon and others, who have joined together in this bipartisan effort, have attempted to understand what those problems are that contributed to the brokenness of the current system and to present a series of prescriptions to correct that. 
We look forward to working with our colleagues in a process of refining the proposal that we have made, but we believe this represents a significant step forward in terms of protecting the rights of American workers, of creating a legal workforce for the American farmer, and particularly the interest of the American consumer. 
Thank you.

Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I am introducing an amendment to the Commerce/Justice/State Appropriations bill regarding the Consular Service and the issuing of tourist visas. 
I strongly endorse tight immigration controls and strict visa policies to ensure that illegal aliens and criminal activity do not cross our nation's borders. 
At the same time, we must recognize the economic importance of tourism in this country and ensure that legitimate foreign travelers are not penalized by an overwhelmed consular service. 
To that end, I am asking the State Department to report to Congress on a regular basis the status of visa backlogs at our embassies worldwide and to conduct a study on whether the appropriate resources are being dedicated to the consular service. 
Tourism is a $473 billion dollar business in the United States and our country's second largest employer, behind the health care industry. 
We bring in more tourists to the U.S. than we send overseas, creating a $26 billion dollar trade surplus, equal in size to the car and auto parts trade deficit with Japan. 
By the year 2007, less than ten years away, the World Tourism Organization predicts the U.S. tourism market will double to nearly $885 billion dollars. 
We must make certain our consular services and visa procedures are streamlined, improved, and protective of national security interests in order to capitalize on the growing international tourism market. 
I hope you can support me in requiring the State Department to study consular resources and report back on what improvements or resources are needed to make it the best in the world, a secure system that can help promote U.S. as an international destination.

Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of H. Con. Res. 298, expressing our deepest condolences and support to the State and people of Florida for the losses they have suffered as a result of wild land fires that occurred throughout June and July of this year. 
Many of my colleagues will remember that Andrew roared ashore in the middle of the night and vented its fury on the people of South Florida. The storm severely disrupted the lives of thousands of families. This August, Floridians will remember Hurricane Andrew with another natural disaster on their minds. Since May 24, a deadly combination of intense heat and prolonged drought sparked more than 2,200 forest fires in Florida's 67 counties. 
Even for a state that is experienced in dealing with natural disasters, these fires have been spawned during what may be one of the worst years in Florida meteorological history. In late January and early February--in the midst of our state's dry season--several Northern Florida counties were deluged by massive floods. Not long after, parts of Central Florida were devastated by thunderstorms and tornadoes that are more typical in the summer months. 
The fire crisis is the latest example of our state's climactic reversal of fortune in 1998. Florida's hot summer temperatures are typically accompanied by afternoon thunderstorms and tropical weather. This year's heat and drought, and the lush undergrowth and foliage that sprung up in the wake of Florida's unusually wet winter, combined to fuel the fires that have put the state under a cloud of smoke and chased nearly 112,000 residents from their homes--7,040 of them into emergency shelters. 
Florida has sustained almost $300 million in private damage, and state and local governments have spent over $100 million in responding to the fires. In a step never before taken in Florida's long history with violent weather, every one of the 45,000 residents of Flagler County--a coastal area between Jacksonville and Daytona Beach--had to be evacuated from their homes over the Independence Day weekend. 
Mr. President, Mother Nature has once again subjected Florida to unprecedented weather conditions. But with the memories of Andrew's aftermath still fresh in our minds, we know that the national response to our pleas for help is anything but unprecedented--and are moved by the immediacy of Americans' heartfelt offers of assistance. 
In response to this crisis, Americans from 44 states are fighting side-by-side with Floridians to prevent these fires from endangering families and engulfing even more homes, businesses, and roads. For example, U.S. Marines, National Guardsmen, and National Weather Service meteorologists from all over the country have converged on Florida. 
California, Oregon, and South Dakota--states whose residents are not strangers to violent weather and natural disasters--sent nearly 1300 fire fighting personnel to Florida. North Carolina, a state that is even more heavily forested than my own, sent 47 fire trucks and 169 firefighters to Florida. Pennsylvania, which lost more than 2,200 citizens in less than ten minutes during the catastrophic Johnstown flood of 1889, has contributed 89 volunteers to combat this natural disaster in 1998. In fact, so many states have donated equipment that two-thirds of all the firefighting helicopters in the United States are now working in Florida. 
Mr. President, I have lived in Florida for more than sixty-one years. In that time, I have never observed wildfires as widespread and unmanageable as those that have plagued our state for the last forty-four days. On behalf of 14 million Floridians, I offer my deepest thanks to the thousands of Americans who have voluntarily left their homes and risked their lives so that our state's fire victims might not lose theirs. They are true heroes, and all of us who proudly call Florida our home are forever in their debt. 
I am pleased to announce that the Herculean efforts of these brave firefighters were not in vain. Floridians who were forced from their homes have now returned, and almost all of the fires have been brought under control. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues in the Senate to support H. Con. Res. 298 to pay tribute to the citizens of Florida and those from around the nation who came to our assistance.

 Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I am proud to join Senator DeWine and my other colleagues in introducing the Western Hemisphere Drug Elimination Act of 1998. This bill will provide an additional $2.6 billion over a 3-year period to implement a more comprehensive eradication, interdiction, and crop substitution strategy for our nation's counter-drug efforts. 
The bill will help the United States meet its goal of reducing the flow of cocaine and heroin into the U.S. by 80 percent in three years by combining a reduction in availability with demand reduction efforts. This is accomplished by providing more funding to those doing the heavy lifting in this fight--the Coast Guard, the Customs Service, the Drug Enforcement Administration, and the Department of Defense.

Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, this amendment has been requested by the National Sheriffs' Association, the Western States Sheriffs' Association, sheriffs' associations from the largest States. It relates to a very narrow issue of the use of surplus aircraft, primarily helicopters, which have been made available to a local law enforcement agency. Today, there are serious restraints on the ability of a local jurisdiction which has an aircraft to make it available to an adjacent jurisdiction for things like search and rescue, overflights for drug control purposes, and a variety of other issues. This has been a major issue, an irritant to local law enforcement. 
It serves, in my opinion, no legitimate national purpose to impose these restraints on the use of donated surplus property aircraft to local law enforcement. I urge adoption of this amendment which will comply with the requests of American law enforcement.

<TEXT>
Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, this evening I rise to offer an amendment with my distinguished colleague, Senator DeWine. This amendment is intended to assist law enforcement in doing a better job of protecting our citizens and the public safety. 
The background of this amendment goes back to 1994. Congress made what I think was an error when it passed Public Law 103-411. Under this law, aircraft belonging to law enforcement agencies are considered to be `commercial' if costs incurred from flying missions to support neighboring jurisdictions are reimbursed. 
Unfortunately, this law has placed unnecessary restrictions and costly burdens on Government agencies which operate public aircraft, particularly law enforcement agencies. The law restricts those agencies from using their aircraft resources in assistance of Government agencies and severely limits their ability to recover costs from those agencies which they are assisting. This law even limits the ability of neighboring jurisdictions to enter into mutual aid agreements. 
Let me give a typical example of how the current law is operating. In my State of Florida, it is not uncommon to have one medium-sized county which is surrounded by a number of smaller jurisdictions. That medium-sized county has the capability to make an application and secure surplus Government property, frequently a helicopter. That helicopter is used in a variety of public safety and law enforcement activities, often under the jurisdiction of the local sheriff. It may be that one of those smaller counties has a need for a helicopter or other aviation support. 
An example of that is, in the northern part of our State we have had instances in which locally grown marijuana has become a serious law enforcement problem. In order to identify that marijuana and effectively eradicate it, the helicopter is an enormous law enforcement asset. Yet, under the current law, if the sheriff from that smaller community wishes to contract, either on an individual case basis or through a mutual aid agreement, with that medium-sized county to get a certain number of hours of utilization of the helicopter and they agree to reimburse the medium-sized county for the cost of that operation, they are in violation of the conditions under which the medium-sized county secured the helicopter in the first place and sanctions might be imposed upon the medium-sized county's sheriff and their capacity to provide effective law enforcement for their smaller neighboring communities. 
At the very time when law enforcement faces the growing sophistication and organization of criminals, the Federal Government should not be placing increased mandates on our law enforcement officials. Today, law enforcement officials are forced to call around and check the availability of a private pilot and commercial aircraft before sending out the helicopter of that medium-sized county. Only if no one is available can law enforcement officials respond to the scene. 
Under this amendment, public agencies would be permitted to recover costs incurred by operating aircraft to assist other jurisdictions for the purposes of law enforcement, search and rescue, or imminent threat to property or natural resources. 
I might say, we just have had a dramatic example of that threat to property or natural resources in the number of wildfires we have experienced across our State, many of them occurring in precisely these smaller counties that are limited in their capability to respond. 
Mr. President, law enforcement organizations are strongly supporting this amendment. This legislation has been endorsed by the National Sheriffs Association, the Airborne Law Enforcement Association, the International Association of Chiefs of Police, the Florida Sheriffs Association, and the California State Sheriffs Association. 
Some months ago, sheriffs from throughout the country contacted my office seeking help. From my home State of Florida, I have heard from Sheriff Stephen M. Oelrich of Alachua County. Sheriff Oelrich stated, `Public Law 103-411 restricts the ability of a law enforcement aviation unit to assist Government jurisdictions or other governmental agencies. Instead, it mandates that a local government must first turn to a costly private operator for air service.' 
This is by no means a problem in my State of Florida alone. I have heard this from sheriffs across the country. Specifically, we have a resolution from the sheriffs of California. 
In the words of Sheriff Larry Carpenter of Ventura County CA, Public Law 103-411 has had `a chilling effect on the ability of local governments to provide safe, cost-effective and professional air support capabilities to the very citizens we serve.' Let me further quote from an article that Sheriff Carpenter wrote in the Summer 1996 issue of California Sheriff:  
The issue of `compensation' fuels this issue to a large degree. According to the FAA interpretation of this law, a sheriff cannot simply recover costs for flying a governmental mission . . . which is `outside a common treasury.' This flies in the face of mutual aid agreements between public safety agencies. For example, let's say the Santa Barbara Sheriff's Department, which has no aviation unit, contacts my aviation unit and requests our helicopter fly an observation and surveillance flight of a suspected drug lab which their narcotics and SWAT teams plan to raid in a few days. We fly the mission, undoubtedly with the Santa Barbara deputy sheriff on board, and charge Santa Barbara County only our cost. There is no profit involved. Obviously, this is a sensitive law enforcement mission. Public Law 103-411 says we can no longer do this. Instead, a private operator would need to be contracted at a higher cost to taxpayers. 
This is only common sense that instead of restricting the ability of local law enforcement agencies to assist each other, we should be facilitating their ability to serve the public good in as efficient and economical manner as possible. 
I urge the adoption of this amendment.

Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleagues in introducing legislation that will simplify and streamline one of the most frustrating aspects in the life of a farmer: Finding qualified, legal farmworkers. 
There are two large issues that cause this problem: (1) According to the December 1997 GAO report, there are at least 600,000 farm workers in the United States illegally--and most have false, but realistic-looking, documents. 
The farmer can go to extreme lengths to verify his workforce, and still be vulnerable to INS enforcement action. 
Our bill, through an Agricultural Registry of workers, ensures that a farmer is able to get a legal, reliable workforce, and our bill ensures that these American workers are paid a premium wage and receive the benefits that they deserve.

Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, earlier today a group of my colleagues representing both sides of the aisle joined together to announce that we would be introducing legislation to increase the security in the retirement of Americans. I want to especially recognize my colleague, Senator Grassley, who has put a tremendous amount of effort into this legislation and, through his position as Chair of the Aging Committee, has demonstrated his commitment to the well-being of older Americans. Senator Grassley and I recognize that for our Nation to solve what would be one of this generation's greatest challenges, building a retirement security for today's workers, we need to move in a commonsense, bipartisan fashion. 
Many of the original cosponsors of this bill were key in crafting the sections of this legislation. Senator Grassley's efforts have expanded fairness for women and families and focused on the benefits of retirement education. Senator Baucus has brought the ideas that expanded pension coverage and eased administration burdens on America's small businesses. Portability, so important as we become a more mobile society, received the specific attention of Senator Jeffords. All businesses will have the hard work of Senator Hatch to thank for many of the regulatory relief and administrative simplification elements of this bill. And Senator Breaux, who focused on the big picture of retirement security leading the CSIS task force, has incorporated some of his ideas and the ideas of that task force into the legislation that we introduced this evening. 
Throughout this process of putting the bill together, our principal task has been one to listen and attempt to understand what we were hearing. We listened at the recent SAVER Summit, which was held here in Washington, DC, held at the direction of this Congress. We listened at town hall meetings throughout our States. We have listened at the Retirement Security Summit, which I held in January of this year in Tampa, FL, and the Women's Summit, which I held in Orlando in April. 
The ideas have come from pension actuaries, tax attorneys, Cabinet leaders, and some of the best ideas from everyday Americans. I want to thank those who have endorsed our proposal. 
Mr. President, with reason, much of the public debate has now focused on President Clinton's call to `Save Social Security first.' I wish to say, as the Senator from New Hampshire has just commented, I, too, benefited by the remarks that were made this evening by the Senator from Minnesota on what is happening on a global basis, in terms of meeting the type of problems which we face in providing retirement security for Americans. We all agree, on both sides of the aisle, that we need to assure that Social Security is as viable for my nine grandchildren and all of their peers, as it was for my parents and will be for me. However, Social Security is only one part of the picture. Pensions and personal savings will make up an ever-increasing part of retirement security. So, when Congress takes action to assure the future of Social Security, we are only addressing one-third of the problem. Our bill addresses the other two-thirds of the problem. 
Social Security will play less of a role for each succeeding generation of Americans. We must develop personal savings. We must assure that years of work pay off in reliable pensions. Our bill will help hard-working Americans build personal retirement savings through their employers, through 401(k)s, through payroll deduction IRAs, through higher limits on savings. The employers and workers both will win. Employers get simpler pension systems with less administrative burden and more loyal employees, and workers build a secure retirement and watch savings accumulate over their years of work. 
How, specifically, will our bill help? The first focus of our bill is small business. The reason for this primary focus is because this is where the greatest difficulties in achieving retirement security are lodged. 
Fifty-one million American workers have no retirement plan at work--51 million Americans without any retirement plan at the place of their employment; 21 million of these employees work in small businesses. The problem: Statistics indicate that only a small percentage of workers in firms of less than 100 employees have access to a retirement plan. 
This chart indicates that there is a direct correlation between the number of employees in a business and the likelihood that there will be a pension retirement plan. Firms with less than 25 employees have a retirement plan of 20.2 percent. Firms of 100 or more have a proportion of retirement plans of almost 85 percent. 
We are particularly focusing our attention on these smallest firms which are the least likely to have retirement plans, but which are the fastest growing segment of our economy. In the State of Florida, these firms of less than 25 have represented well over 70 percent of the job growth in our State in the last 5 years. 
We take a step forward in eliminating one of the principal hurdles that small businesses face when establishing a pension plan. 
What is that problem? It is the Federal Government having two hands: On the one hand, the Federal Government is encouraging these businesses to start pension plans, but when they hand out the second hand, they find that the Federal Government wants a palm turned up because the Federal Government is asking for up to $1,000 for a small business to register its plan with the Internal Revenue Service. 
We eliminate this fee for small businesses. We need to encourage small businesses to start plans, not discourage them with high registration fees. 
Mr. President, the second target of our legislation is women and families. Historically speaking, women live longer than men. Therefore, they need greater savings for retirement because they will have to stretch those savings over more years of life. Yet, our pension and retirement laws do not reflect this fundamental reality. Women are more mobile than men, moving in and out of the workforce due to family responsibilities. Thus, they are less likely to vest in a retirement system. Most retirement systems require a minimum period of time before the employee becomes eligible and has a legal entitlement to the retirement funds. Women are the least likely to meet those minimum years of employment. 
As this chart indicates, of women retirees today, 68 percent of women who retire have no retirement benefits; fewer than 32 percent have a pension for their retirement. 
Currently, two-thirds of working women are employed in sectors of the economy that are unlikely to offer a retirement plan--service and retail and small businesses. 
What is the solution? In an effort to address one of the problems of preparing for a longer life expectancy, we realistically adjust upward the age at which you must start withdrawing funds from your own 401(k) or other similar pension instrument. 
Under the current law, you must, you are obligated to start withdrawing money from your retirement plan once you reach the age of 70 1/2 , 70 years and 6 months. At the age of 70 years and 6 months, you are obligated to commence the process of withdrawing funds from your retirement plan. However, a woman at the age of 70 can still have three decades to look forward to 
in retirement. I know this because I represent many of these wonderful people in my State of Florida. 
At the retirement summit I hosted in Tampa, several retirees mentioned that they wanted to keep their money in retirement savings for as long as possible. We propose to raise the 70 years and 6 months age to 75 for mandatory distribution. We do this for both genders, because I am happy to say that men are also living longer. It just happens that women will be the most affected group of Americans by this proposal. 
We go beyond raising the age from 70 years and 6 months to 75 years by also providing that $300,000 of any defined benefit contribution plan will be exempt from minimum distribution rules. 
This accomplishes several important objectives: Simplifying the bureaucracy for thousands of Americans who have less than $300,000 in their retirement fund, and protecting a vital nest egg for the last years of retirement so that items such as long-term care and other expenses that are part of the aging process can be covered. 
Next, Mr. President, we deal with the issue of increasing portability. Over an average 40-year career, the current U.S. worker will have seven different employers. This represents a dramatic shift from the current worker's employment pattern from that of their grandparents where it was common for a person to commence their career and end their career with the same employer. 
We have the possibility of a generation of American workers who retire with many small retirement accounts, creating a complex maze of statements and features different for each account. 
The solution that we propose includes addressing one element of this by allowing employees, such as teachers, who happen to move from one State to another, to buy into their current locality's defined benefit pension system through the purchase of service credits so that when they retire, they will have one retirement account. It is easier to monitor, less complicated to maintain records about and builds a more secure retirement for the worker. 
The next issue that our legislation confronts is that of reducing red tape and administrative complexities. As I mentioned earlier, 51 million Americans have no pensions. The main obstacle that companies face in establishing a retirement program is often bureaucratic administrative burden. 
For example, for a small plan, the plan that would deal with companies that have 25 or fewer employees--in this case, the specific example is for a plan with 15 employees--it costs $228 per employee per year just to comply with all the forms, tests and regulations required to maintain a pension plan. 
We have a commonsense remedy to one of the most vexing problems in pension administration: figuring out how much money to contribute to the company's plan. It is a complex formula of facts, statistics and assumptions under the current law. We want to be able to say to plans that you have no problem with underfunding. To help make these calculations, you can use the prior year's data to make the proper contribution, and if you do so, you will not be subject to any after-the-fact sanctions. You don't have to re-sort through the numbers each and every year. If your plan is sound, use reliable data from the previous year and then verify when all the final details are available. Companies will be able to calculate and then budget, not wait until figures and rates out of their control are released by external sources. 
Another issue is pension security. Under current law, companies cannot fully fund their pension determination liability; that is, provide for a sufficient amount of funding in their pension retirement trust fund to be able to fund that particular pension to its full actuarial amount. 
The inability to do so puts workers at risk that the appropriate funds will not be available when their workforce retires. Solution? It makes little sense for the Federal Government to discourage companies from fully funding their pension plans. We propose to repeal this limit, the limit that keeps companies from fully funding their plan. In last year's tax bill we phased this limit up. Now we have a chance to take the final step and allow companies the flexibility to put more money in their pension plans when their economic circumstances allow. 
The next provision in our legislation, Mr. President, encourages retirement education. The unfortunate reality is that many Americans do not prepare for retirement because they just do not know that they need to. It has been said in jest, but unfortunately it happens in too many cases--it is true--that Americans spend more time planning a 2-week summer vacation than they do 20 or 30 or more years of retirement. 
Studies show that with education, participation rates in retirement savings vehicles jump dramatically. Eighty-one percent of Americans say retirement education has encouraged them to earmark more money for the future. So as Americans have a better understanding of what is involved in retirement--the financial aspects of retirement, the issues of personal health, issues of utilization of leisure time, and all of the other challenges that come in retirement--Americans respond as we would expect, with intelligence and appropriate steps to protect their and their families' interests. 
Our solution is to let the Federal Government serve as a role model. Programs already in place to educate our own Federal employees about the need to prepare for retirement should be broadly shared with other firms, both private and public. We ask that the paradigm for these discussions be made available to the general public so that they can be used by American workers who are employed by organizations beyond the Federal Government. 
We also ask that the Small Business Administration, which is so helpful to America's entrepreneurs in getting ventures off the ground and expanding when times are right, be involved in outreach in the retirement arena. Through web sites, brochures, whatever means they feel best, the Small Business Administration can help spread the word on what has already been accomplished--simple accounts, payroll deduction IRAs, and more--and keep businesses up to date with each opportunity to save for a secure retirement. 
Mr. President, I thank my colleagues who have worked so hard on this measure. I ask for the support of those in this Chamber on this important legislation.

Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, this amendment would require Country of Origin labeling of perishable agricultural commodities imported into the United States. I offer this amendment to ensure that Americans know the origin of every orange, banana, tomato, cucumber, and green pepper on display in the grocery store, and to improve the safety of food consumed by all Americans. 
In March of 1996, shoppers throughout California and nineteen other states discovered that the produce they had brought home from the grocery store was accompanied by an uninvited and unwelcome guest--cyclospora, a harmful parasite that invades the small intestine and causes extreme diarrhea, vomiting, weight loss, and severe muscle aches. 
Immediately, the federal government's Center for Disease Control (CDC) sprang into action. The agency traced the illness to contaminated Guatemalan raspberries and directed consumers to avoid buying fruit from the Central American nation until the outbreak could be investigated, contained, and eradicated. 
Americans take this kind of urgent health directive seriously. But millions of shoppers found that their hands were tied against following the CDC's instructions. In 49 states, consumers discovered that grocery stores were not required to post where their fresh fruits and vegetables had been grown. The information required to prevent other Americans from getting sick simply wasn't available. 
Florida was the exception. For nearly twenty years, Floridians shopping at their local Publix, Winn Dixie, Food Lion, and other grocery stores have been able to make educated choices about the food products they purchase for their families. In 1979, in my first year as Governor, I proudly signed legislation to make country-of-origin labels commonplace in produce sections all over Florida. 
Country-of-origin labelling is not new to the American marketplace. For decades, `Made In' labels have been as visible as price tags on clothes, toys, television sets, watches, and many other products. It makes no sense that they are nowhere to be found in the produce section of grocery stores in the vast majority of states. 
President Clinton has unveiled a number of food safety initiatives over the past several months. Although his plans commendably call for strict safety measures in the growing and harvesting of domestic fruits and vegetables, and establish the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as another line of defense against potentially contaminated imported produce, they do not empower individual shoppers with the knowledge they need to make educated choices in the produce section. 
As the Guatemalan case illustrated, that is a dangerous omission. The current lack of identifying information on produce means that Americans who wish to heed government health warnings about foreign products or who have justifiable concerns about other nations' labor, environmental, and agricultural standards are powerless to choose other perishibles. 
Contrary to many claims opposing this legislation, compliance with a country of origin law would be of minimal cost to our nation's retailers. Both Publix and Winn Dixie have estimated that compliance costs most individual grocery stores less than $10 each month. The total cost for more than 25,000 retail stores in Florida is less than $195,000 annually. 
That's a small price to pay for consumers' peace of mind, and to preserve the concept of choice that is the foundation for our nation's free market system. Any first-year economics student knows that the laws of supply and demand do not work unless consumers have adequate information about goods and services for sale. Fruits and vegetables are no exception. 
In addition, a study by the U.S. Department of Agriculture found that twenty-six of our key trading partners, including Guatemala, require country of origin labeling for fresh fruits and vegetables. By adopting this amendment, our law will become more consistent with the laws of our global trading partners, and would not constitute an unfair barrier to trade. 
Giving consumers greater confidence in the produce they buy should be a central part of our nation's efforts to improve food safety. Congress can take a major step toward meeting that goal by enacting this amendment, and restoring American shoppers' ability to make an informed decision.

Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I thank the Chair. 
I rise to strongly oppose this amendment, and I believe that the amendment has been mischaracterized, or at least the most reasonable reading of this amendment is different from the interpretation it has been given. If in fact it is the intention to have this amendment not apply to applications for national security purposes or purposes of punishing those who have engaged in terrorist activities or other events which were directed against the citizens or the society of the United States of America, then the amendment should be clarified, because the plain reading of the amendment on page 1 beginning at line 14 states: 
Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the President shall not restrict or otherwise prohibit any exports (including financing) of food, other agricultural products (including fertilizer), medicines or medical equipment as part of any policy of existing or future unilateral economic sanctions imposed against a foreign government. 
Now, the sanctions are the remedy for the action that has led us to be in a state of opposition to that foreign government. The cause of that might be that they were encouraging terrorism or they were engaged in activities that were considered to be a threat to our national security. 
The means of achieving that retaliation against a foreign government is a sanction, in this case an economic sanction. The economic sanction is not the reason that we are imposing; it is the means of the imposition. And so this language does not speak to the causation of why we are imposing the sanction; it just says that whatever the cause, whether it is terrorism, national security, or whatever reason, the President is prohibited from having as one of his arrows in the quiver of remedies an economic sanction that includes all of those items which are listed in this amendment.

Mr. GRAHAM. But clearly, the plain interpretation of the sentence that I just read is that the remedy against whatever the cause might be, whether it is nuclear proliferation, support of terrorists, attack against our national security, harboring drug traffickers, or whatever the cause may be, we are just saying that, notwithstanding any other provision of law, we have denied from the President of the United States as one of the remedies against that causation the use of unilateral economic sanctions when those sanctions include food, agricultural products, medicines, and medical equipment. 
If that is not the intention, then I think the sponsors of this amendment should offer a modification--and I believe that is now within their power to do so--to clearly state it is not intended that the use of food, agricultural products, medicines, and medical equipment not be a restriction on the President's ability to use those products where the causation is terrorism, causation is an attack against national security, or some other cause. And then we could have a reasoned debate on just what would be the reach of this amendment. 
I might also say, I am concerned about the language of this amendment in that we have been focusing on food--wheat, corn, other products of human nutrition. But the language goes on to say `other agricultural products (including fertilizer).' 
Now, with that parenthetical, it seems to me that we are not to sanction not only food but other agricultural products, including those products which are used by that country in the production of its own indigenous agricultural food and fiber. That obviously would be the only reason to specifically exempt fertilizer. What about seed? Would that be an agricultural product against which the President could not impose a sanction? Would tractors, combines, other of the mechanics and equipment of agricultural production be similarly excluded from the President's range of sanctions that could be used? 
I believe the very fact that those questions are raised goes to one of the reasons that it is imprudent, at 7:50 p.m. on this Wednesday evening, for us to be considering this amendment. This amendment has been introduced as freestanding legislation. I assume it is before some committee of the Senate. The normal manner in which we would consider an issue of this importance would be to have a hearing, to have the language subjected to close scrutiny, not just the kind of scrutiny that can be provided here on the Senate floor by those of us who have an interest in and some knowledge of this matter, and a genuine public debate. 
After the idea has withstood that kind of inquiry, then it is mature to come to the Senate for consideration, for adoption, adoption that would reverse three to four decades of powers which the President of the United States has been granted by this Congress in order to achieve important U.S. national objectives. 
It is also ironic that we are doing this at this time, when we have recently established a separate task force whose purpose will be to review our current sanctions policy and to bring to us their reasoned judgments as to what we should do. It seems to me that prudence would indicate that the appropriate thing to do would be to at least wait until that group that we have just established has an opportunity to complete its work and give us the benefit of its recommendation, as to what our policy should be in this area.

<DOCNO>105-graham-fl-8-19980715</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
Mr. GRAHAM. I am sorry that we didn't have a question, but the Senator has moved me to point 2 of my remarks, which is the undercurrent of much of this debate, where we focus on the poor, particularly the hungry children. Everyone is moved by those emotions. There is a natural humanitarian concern about people, particularly innocent people, being denied access to the basic necessities of life. 
What offends me is the assumption that it is the U.S. embargo policy, whether it is against Iraq, Iran, North Korea, Cuba, or whatever rogue state, that is the cause of that impoverishment. This is a return to that classic `Let's blame America first' argument. Let's find out what is wrong with the world and then let's blame the United States of America for being responsible. 
The person who is responsible for the economic conditions in Cuba is not sitting in this room and is not residing at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. The person who is responsible for Cuba's impoverishment is named Fidel Castro and he lives in Havana. Whether we do or do not adopt this amendment tonight, he still is going to be living in Havana and he still is going to be following discredited economic policies. He is still going to be following a personal attitude of disrespect to his own people. He still is going to be following authoritarian dictates--because he wants to stay in power. 
So, Mr. President, the idea that we have to blame America first and find ourselves to be at fault for the poverty and the misery of the poor, particularly the young and the halt and the elderly, in these rogue nations, I reject and I find to be offensive personally, I find to be offensive to the values of the United States of America. 
Mr. President, let me move to the third point, if I could, and that is I do want to speak specifically.

Mr. GRAHAM. I think the Senator's question makes the first point I made, and that is the inappropriateness of trying to write a piece of legislation that is as nuanced and delicate as this on the floor. I pointed out what I thought was clearly an interpretation that said that whatever the cause, we were going to be denying as a remedy the use of unilateral economic sanctions which included this prescribed list of food, agricultural products, medicine and medical equipment. Now the Senator is suggesting that he doesn't really want to go as far as this language and would like to say, at least in the area of national security, that we don't have to deal with our enemies. 
I think, personally, that is too narrow a construction. I think there are a variety of types of activities that the President of the United States, with the authorization of Congress, ought to be able to sanction in the most severe possible way, including denying them the products that are listed in this legislation. 
I don't think we ought to try to write that on the Senate floor at now 8 o'clock at night. This is exactly the type of considered judgment that we would say in this great deliberative body ought to be deliberated in an appropriate committee with appropriate public input.

<DOCNO>105-graham-fl-13-19980715</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
Mr. GRAHAM. I would be very happy if this amendment would ride into the sunset as long as it didn't return. 
Point 3 does relate specifically to Cuba which is an object case of the point 2, which is that the reason that Cuba is in its desperate economic circumstances is not to be blamed on the United States and our policy, it is to be blamed on Fidel Castro. The reason it didn't happen 20 or 30 years earlier is because as long as there was a Soviet Union, the Soviet Union was subsidizing Cuba to the extent of 20 to 30 percent of its gross domestic product. When the Soviet Union collapsed in the late eighties, its ability to continue to provide that kind of subsidy to Cuba also collapsed and all of the underlying inadequacies of a statist, Communist economic policy surfaced. 
For us to say that we are responsible for the impoverishment of the Cuban people because we have denied them access to food, agricultural products, medicine and medical equipment, I think, is, frankly, absurd and an affront to the people of the United States of America. It is Fidel Castro who has placed his people in that condition, not the people of the United States. 
Maybe the most dramatic example of that, just a few years ago when our colleague and visionary, the Senator from New Jersey, was a Member of the House of Representatives, he sponsored legislation which established the modern U.S. embargo policy relative to Cuba. I am pleased to say that I was honored to be the Senate sponsor of that legislation. 
In that legislation, medicine was excluded from the commercial sanction against Cuba. There is a license policy required in order for a Cuban entity to purchase medicines from the United States, but that is available. 
Do you know what has happened in the intervening now some 5 years since that access to commercial purchases of U.S. medicines by Cuba has been in effect? What has happened is zero has happened, because Cuba has not availed itself of this opportunity it had. Why hasn't it availed itself? I suggest primarily because Fidel Castro has some higher priorities in terms of his use of Cuban resources, like continuing to fund one of the most oppressive state police in the world, continuing to try to maintain what is left of a military capability. Those have all had higher priorities and, therefore, there were little resources left to use the special access through license policy for U.S. medicines.

Mr. GRAHAM. Thank you. I appreciate those kind remarks, and no one is more dedicated to the freedom of the people of Cuba than is our friend and colleague from New Jersey. He has demonstrated that dedication time and time again. 
As he said in his earlier remarks, not only are we not the source of the blame of the impoverishment of the people of Cuba, in fact, the United States, both governmentally but primarily through the generosity of its people, has provided through donations more humanitarian assistance to Cuba in the last 4 years than the foreign aid of all other governments in the world combined. Now to say blame America first, make us the object and the source of Cuba's poverty is an affront. 
My final point is that by adopting this policy, we will also be missing the opportunity to adopt a policy that has the potential of making a significant difference in terms of the U.S. national interest, but more importantly the human interest of the people living in Cuba. 
What is that policy? It is also one to which the Senator from New Jersey alluded in his opening remarks, and that is a policy that says: Let us increase the opportunities for the people of the United States with modest Government assistance to join that philanthropy to provide humanitarian needs to the people of Cuba. But instead of being done on a commercial basis, which means that Fidel Castro will be in control of what is purchased and how it is distributed and how it is used to either reward or punish activities which the state considers to be beneficial, let us use the nongovernmental organizations, such as the religious organizations in Cuba, to be the means of distributing the humanitarian products. Let us use that as a means of assuring that this humanitarian effort will not be perverted for political goals. 
Let us use it as a means of increasing the strength of those nongovernmental organizations, because they will play a critical role today in the life of the people of Cuba, attempting to lift some of the burden which Fidel Castro has imposed upon those people. Those same nongovernmental organizations will play a critical role during the period of transition in Cuba. 
One of the key questions for the United States is not whether there will be change in Cuba. Of course there will be change. No one can tell you exactly the hour and the date of that change, but that it will come is assured. What we do not know is whether that change will be more like Czechoslovakia, a `velvet revolution,' relatively without bloodshed or conflict, or whether it will be more like the nation whose head of state spoke to us earlier today, Romania, where thousands of people were injured or killed during the course of the transition from an authoritarian to a democratic government. 
I believe the nongovernmental organizations in Cuba will play a critical role in facilitating a peaceful transition and that by using them rather than, as this amendment would propose to do, the Government of Cuba, as the instrument for the distribution of humanitarian assistance, we have the opportunity to strengthen and elevate those nongovernmental organizations.

Mr. GRAHAM. As well as every other aspect of the embargo. And with great respect, I believe that the policy that says, rather than lift the embargo, strengthen Fidel Castro, with no real prospects, with a country so impoverished as Cuba, that they are going to be able to compete in the commercial market to buy agricultural products--why aren't they buying medicines today? They have been authorized to do it for 5 years, and yet they have not availed themselves. 
The reason is probably that it is not a high enough priority of Fidel Castro to use his limited resources to buy antibiotics. He would rather buy equipment that his military and secret police can use to suppress the people. There is no expectation he is going to use any availability of the commercial purchase of foods to any greater extent that he has used his potential of commercial purchase of medicines. 
What I think does offer hope is to encourage a policy of U.S. private citizen, with limited Government support, philanthropy through nongovernmental organizations to the people of Cuba, both to meet and alleviate some of their current deprivations and build up some institutions that will help in the transition in Cuba. 
Mr. President, for those four stated reasons, I believe this amendment, well intended as it might be, is inappropriate for our consideration at 8:14 p.m. on the evening of July the 15th. I hope that it will be the wisdom of the U.S. Senate, if we are given the opportunity, to set this aside through a motion to table, and that we would see the wisdom of that opportunity and then would look to the bipartisan commission on sanctions as well as the standard traditional processes of deliberation in the Senate as a means to fully explore whether we, in fact, want to change a 40-year policy of the use of economic sanctions against some of the most rapacious or rogue states on this planet.

Mr. GRAHAM. I hope that at some point someone will explain what that modification is. But this question relates to a different issue. 
One of the typical restraints that the United States has imposed on the sale of food and medicine to suspect countries has been that there has to be an independent source of distribution so that the food and medicine will not be, as allegedly has occurred in North Korea, diverted just to feed the soldiers and let the civilian population starve. 
In light of that, I am concerned with the language on line 15, where it states that `the President shall not restrict or otherwise prohibit any exports,' and then it lists the items. 
Would this mean that the President could not impose a restriction, such as the requirement that, yes, we will provide food and medicine, but in a manner that will assure that the people for whose good we intended it to be utilized will be fed, will be medicated, not the elite or those elements of the society that are serving to oppress the people? Would the President be prohibited from making those kinds of restrictions?

Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, members of the Senate, today I join my colleague, Senator Mack, in offering an amendment to the Agriculture Appropriations bill that will provide much needed relief to agriculture in the State of Florida in the wake of the extreme drought and severe wildfires that have plagued our State in the last two months. 
The fire crisis is the latest example of our State's meteorological reversal of fortune in 1998. Florida's hot summer temperatures are typically accompanied by afternoon thunderstorms and tropical weather. This year's heat and drought, and the lush undergrowth and foliage that sprung up in the wake of Florida's unusually wet winter, combine to fuel the fires that have put the State under a cloud of smoke and chased nearly 112,000 residents from their homes, 2,000 of them into emergency shelters. 
These fires have had severe consequences. More than 220 homes, businesses, or buildings have been destroyed or heavily damaged. Nearly 100 individuals, mostly brave firefighters battling the blazes, have been injured. A 140-mile stretch of Interstate 95 was closed for several days. 458,000 acres of land have burned. 
Florida has sustained almost $300 million in damage. In a step never before taken in Florida's long history with violent weath, every one of the 45,000 residents of Flagler County--a coastal area between Jacksonville and Daytona Beach--had to be evacuated from their homes over the Independence Day weekend. 
On June 19, 1998, President Clinton declared all 67 Florida counties as a major disaster area and made them eligible for immediate federal financial assistance. In the weeks that followed that declaration, FEMA officials skillfully coordinated relief efforts and worked hard to channel additional aid to the hardest hit areas. 
Both the fires and their original cause, the extreme drought throughout the state, have contributed to a drastic impact on Florida agriculture, particularly in the North and West areas of the State. 600,000 acres of summer crops were destroyed or severely damaged by the drought conditions. Hardest hit has been corn which has suffered a 100 percent low on about 80,000 acres and 50 percent yield loss on another 20,000 acres. Value of the lost corn crops as of June 22, 1998, was identified to be $20 million. Cotton, peanuts, soybeans, and watermelons have suffered 25 to 30 percent losses. 
At the end of June, virtually none of the $60 million hay crop was harvested, causing the potential for a major shortage of winter feed even when the drought subsides. 
In the Panhandle area, many of the 7,000 farmers are facing their third straight year of destructive weather conditions after tropical storms and hurricanes in 1996 and 1997. In this region alone, farmers have invested more than $100 million in borrowed money to plant this year's crop, only to find themselves with no prospect of harvest at this time. 
In response to this dire situation, on July 9, 1998, Secretary Glickman declared the state of Florida to be an Agriculture Disaster area, making agriculture in Florida eligible for federal financial assistance. 
This declaration makes Florida agriculture eligible for several Department of Agriculture programs including:

Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, this amendment will increase by $2 million the funds available to the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service in their battle against the Mediterranean Fruit Fly, or medfly. I am, unfortunately, all too familiar with the devastation caused by these tiny pests, and I am particularly concerned this year, because Florida has experienced an unusual number of medfly infestations. 
In the past, medflies have caused significant damage to Florida fruit and vegetable crops. This year's infestation is particularly troubling, because it has occurred in the heart of Florida's citrus and tomato growing country. In Lake County, over 1,300 medflies have been detected since the end of April. In Manatee County, over 550 medflies have been detected since the first find in mid-May. In fact, just last week, a medfly was discovered in Highlands County, and as of today, over 100 new flies have been detected in this area. 
Unless fully eradicated, the medfly has the potential to cause hundreds of millions of dollars in damage to Florida fruit and vegetable crops. In addition, medfly infestation provides our trading partners with a convenient reason to deny the entry of Florida fresh fruits and vegetables into their country. Florida's growers have spent a considerable amount of time and money in their efforts to gain access to important markets, like Mexico. Each time medflies are discovered in Florida, growers are forced to take a giant step backwards in their markets access efforts. 
The eradication efforts themselves, through ground or aerial spraying and the release of sterile medflies, are also expensive, costing the State of Florida and the federal government over $20 million last year. 
The funds provided by this amendment will enhance APHIS's efforts to exclude and detect the medfly. Funds will be utilized to increase trapping and detection activities, particularly in urban areas and near ports-of-entry, where the introduction of this pest is most likely. Increasing funds for this program will also help to reassure our trading partners that the U.S. is committed to medfly control, and will deter them from restricting the entry of citrus products and other important agricultural exports. 
In conclusion, I would like to make it very clear that this is only the first step in a more comprensive strategy to address this critical problem. Because medflies commonly enter the United States via larval-infested fruit carried through ports-of-entry by travelers or by commercial fruit smugglers, I have asked the Department of Agriculture to undertake an immediate review of their inspection procedures at Florida ports-of-entry, in order to evaluate the effectiveness of the inspection process. The Department of Agriculture has indicated that this review will be completed within the next three to four months. The results of the review will provide us with a roadmap for future actions, including the appropriate funding levels for a fully effective inspection program. I look forward to working closely with the Chairman and Ranking member to find a more permanent solution to this critical problem.  On page 67, after line 23 add the following:

Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today, along with Senators Chafee, Johnson, Grassley, Harkin, Hollings, and Inouye to introduce the Nursing Home Patient Protection Act--legislation to protect our nation's seniors from indiscriminate patient dumping. This bill modifies the original legislation to include several simple changes to alleviate the concerns of the nursing home industry and senior citizen advocates. It is with their support that we encourage the Senate to take action on this important piece of legislation. I have also included the following letters of support from the American Home Care Association and the National Seniors Law Center. 
A few months ago, it looked like 93-year old Adela Mongiovi might have to spend her 61st Mother's Day away from the assisted living facility that she has called home for the last four years. 
At least that's what son Nelson and daughter-in-law Gina feared when officials at the Rehabilitation and Healthcare Center of Tampa told them that their Alzheimer's Disease-afflicted mother would have to be relocated so that the nursing home could complete `renovations.' 
As the Mongiovis told me when I met with them and visited their mother in Tampa last March, the real story far exceeded their worst fears. The supposedly temporary relocation was actually a permanent eviction of all 52 residents whose housing and care were paid for by the Medicaid program. 
The nursing home chain which owns the Tampa facility and several others across the United States wanted to purge its nursing homes of Medicaid residents, ostensibly to take more private insurance payers and Medicare beneficiaries which pay more per resident. 
This may have been a good financial decision in the short run, however, its effects on our nation's senior citizens, if practiced on a widespread basis, would be even more disastrous. 
In an April 7, 1998 Wall Street Journal article, several nursing home executives argued that state governments and Congress are to blame for these evictions because they have set Medicaid reimbursement rates too low. 
While Medicaid payments to nursing homes may need to be revised, playing Russian roulette with elderly patients' lives is hardly the way to send that message to Congress. And while I am willing to engage in a discussion as to the equity of nursing home reimbursement rates, I and my colleagues are not willing to allow nursing facilities to dump patients indiscriminately. 
The fact that some nursing home companies are willing to sacrifice elderly Americans for the sake of their bottom-line is bad enough. What's even worse is their attempt to evade blame for Medicaid evictions. 
The starkest evidence of this shirking of responsibility is found in the shell game many companies play to justify evictions. Current law allows nursing homes to discharge patients for inability to pay. 
If a facility decreases its number of Medicaid beds, the state and federal governments are no longer allowed to pay the affected residents' bills. They can then be conveniently and unceremoniously dumped for--you guessed it--their inability to pay. 
Evictions of nursing home residents have a devastating effect on the health and well-being of some of society's most vulnerable members. 
A recent University of Southern California study indicated that those who are uprooted from their homes undergo a phenomenon known as `transfer trauma.' For these seniors, the consequences are stark. The death rate among these seniors is two to three times higher than that for individuals who receive continuous care. 
Those of us who believe that our mothers, fathers, and grandparents are safe because Medicaid affects only low-income Americans, we need to think again. 
A three-year stay in a nursing home can cost upwards of $125,000. As a result, nearly half of all nursing home residents who enter as privately-paying patients exhaust their personal savings and lose health insurance coverage during their stay. Medicaid becomes many retirees' last refuge of financial support. 
On April 10, the Florida Medicaid Bureau responded to evidence of Medicaid dumping in Tampa by levying a steep, $260,000 fine against the Tampa nursing home. That was a strong and appropriate action, but it was only a partial solution. Medicaid funding is a shared responsibility of states and the federal government. 
And while the most egregious incident occurred in Florida, Medicaid dumping is not just a Florida problem. While nursing homes were once locally-run and family-owned, they are increasingly administered by multi-state, multi-facility corporations that have the power to affect seniors across the United States. 
Mr. President, let me also point out that the large majority of nursing homes in America treat their residents well and are responsible community citizens. Our bill is designed solely to prevent potential future abuses by bad actors. 
And this new bill is better, simple and fair. It would prohibit current Medicaid beneficiaries or those who `spend down' to Medicaid from being evicted from their homes. And that is a crucial point, Mr. President. 
Adela Mongiovi is not just a `beneficiary.' She is also a mother and grandmother. And to Adela Mongiovi, the Rehabilitation and Health Care Center of Tampa is not an `assisted living facility.' To Adela Mongiovi--this is home. 
This is the place where she wants--and deserves--like all seniors--to live the rest of her life with the security of knowing that she will not be evicted. And through passage of this bill, Mr. President, we can provide that security to Adela Mongiovi and all of our nation's seniors.

Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I am here with a sense of disappointment in that the President of the United States today is visiting my State and, particularly, visiting areas of the State that have recently been ravaged by an unprecedented series of wildfires. I regret that because of the schedule of the Senate, particularly the votes we have just taken this morning and those we will take later in the day, I was unable to accept the President's invitation, which he had generously extended to my colleague, Senator Mack, and myself. Therefore, I would like to take this opportunity to make a statement to my colleagues as to the circumstances in Florida. 
Mr. President, next month--on August 24--Floridians will observe the sixth anniversary of one of the worst natural disasters in recent memory: Hurricane Andrew. 
Many of my colleagues will remember that Andrew roared ashore in the middle of the night and vented its fury on the people of South Florida. The storm severely disrupted the lives of thousands of families. It damaged 128,000 homes and left approximately 160,000 people homeless. The insurance industry estimates that Andrew cost our state nearly $30 billion. 
Perhaps even more sobering than these numbers is the knowledge that the devastation and loss of life would have been even worse had the storm struck just twenty miles to the north, in the heart of downtown Miami. 
These facts demonstrate the unprecedented nature of Hurricane Andrew's destructive force. 
But perhaps even more unprecedented was the tremendous generosity shown by people outside of Florida in the aftermath of Andrew's driving rains and fierce winds. Americans from every corner of our nation put their lives on hold to assist those Floridians whose lives had been turned upside down by Mother Nature. Some sent food and supplies. Others packed up cars, loaded vans, and boarded buses so that they could join relief efforts. 
State disaster agencies lent personnel, expertise, and know-how to the Florida Department of Community Affairs in its clean-up efforts. 
This enormous outpouring of support by Americans for people they had never met and neighborhoods they had probably never visited reaffirmed our belief in the vitality and essential goodness of the human spirit. 
This August, Floridians will remember Hurricane Andrew with another natural disaster on their minds. Since May 24, a deadly combination of intense heat and prolonged drought has sparked more than 2,000 forest fires in Florida's 67 counties. Even for a state that is experienced in dealing with natural disasters, these fires have been spawned during what may be one of the worst years in Florida meteorological history. 
In late January and early February--in the midst of our state's dry season--several Northern Florida counties were deluged by massive floods. Not long after, parts of Central Florida were devastated by thunderstorms and tornadoes that are more typical in the summer months. 
The fire crisis is the latest example of our state's climactic reversal of fortune in 1998. Florida's hot summer temperatures are typically accompanied by afternoon thunderstorms and tropical weather. This year's heat and drought, and the lush undergrowth and foliage that sprung up in the wake of Florida's unusually wet winter, combined to fuel the fires that have put the state under a cloud of smoke and chased nearly 112,000 residents from their homes--7,040 of them into emergency shelters. 
The numbers that I have just cited, and those that I will provide hereafter, are the result of analyses done by local and State emergency agencies and the Federal Emergency Management Agency. 
These fires have had severe consequences. More than 350 homes, businesses, or buildings have been destroyed or heavily damaged. Nearly 100 individuals, mostly brave firefighters battling the blazes, have been injured. 
Fortunately, as of today there have been no lives lost directly as a result of the wildfires. 
A 140-mile stretch of Interstate 95 which was closed for several days was recently reopened. Four hundred and eighty-three thousand acres of land have been burned. As of the current estimate of damage, with higher estimates anticipated as a full economic accounting can be completed, there has been damage sustained of almost $300 million to private interests and over $100 million in costs to local, State, and Federal Governments. 
In a step never before taken in Florida's long history with violent weather, on Friday of last week every one of the 45,000 residents of Flagler County, a county that is just north of Daytona Beach, had to be evacuated from their homes. That evacuation continued over the Independence Day weekend. 
I happened to be with Governor Chiles when he made that mandatory evacuation order. There is no more difficult requirement of a Governor than to order people out of their homes for their safety. Governor Chiles was resolute, he was prompt, he was compassionate in that order, and it no doubt resulted in substantial saving of lives, of potential injuries, and the homes of those persons who were evacuated. 
Mr. President, Mother Nature has once again subjected Florida to unprecedented weather conditions. 
But with the memories of recent disasters, such as Hurricanes Opal and Andrew, and the aftermath still fresh in our minds, we know that the national response to our pleas for help is anything but unprecedented and are moved by the immediacy of America's heartfelt offers of assistance. 
The Clinton Administration and Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) moved quickly to ensure that Florida could rely on the federal government as a full partner in its battle against the fires. On June 19, President Clinton declared all 67 Florida counties as a major disaster area and made them eligible for immediate federal financial assistance. 
In the weeks following that declaration, FEMA officials have skillfully coordinated relief efforts and worked hard to channel additional aid to the hardest hit areas. We greatly appreciate the continued efforts of FEMA Director James Lee Witt and his agency. Director Witt has spent much of his six years on the job in the Sunshine State--responding to Hurricane Opal, floods in North Florida, tornadoes in Central Florida, and now fires in every corner of the state. 
I commend him and his fellow FEMA employees for their long-standing dedication to helping Floridians recover from Mother Nature's wrath. 
But it is not just FEMA that has responded to this crisis. Americans from 44 states are fighting side-by-side with Floridians to prevent these fires from endangering families and engulfing even more homes, businesses, and roads. For example, U.S. Marines, National Guardsmen, and National Weather Service meteorologists from all over the country have converged on Florida. Two hundred and twenty-six firefighters and 53 firefighting vehicles have been airlifted from California, Oregon, and South Dakota, states whose residents are not strangers to violent weather and natural disasters. 
North Carolina, a state that is even more heavily forested than my own, has sent 47 fire trucks and 95 firefighters to Florida. 
Pennsylvania, which lost more than 2,200 citizens in less than ten minutes during the catastrophic Johnstown flood of 1889, has contributed 80 volunteers to combat this natural disaster in 1998. 
So many states have donated equipment that two-thirds of all the firefighting helicopters in the United States are now working in Florida. 
Even foreign governments have been eager to lend a hand. As Miami Herald Staff Writer Cyril Zaneski reported on July 4th, the Canadian provinces of Quebec and Ontario `offered firefighting tanker planes capable of dropping about 9,500 gallons of water an hour and refilling their tanks without landing.' 
I am pleased to announce that the Herculean efforts of these brave firefighters have not been in vain. The tide is turning. 
Over the last few days, those Floridians who were forced from their homes have returned. Most of the fires have been brought under control. Meteorologists are predicting lower temperatures and more rain in the coming days. 
We have not reached the end of this crisis--but I am hopeful that this good news marks the beginning of the end. 
Before I conclude today, I want to share a story that I think demonstrates why Floridians are so grateful for the efforts of our friends from around the nation.

Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I am very pleased that the President of the United States is going to Florida today, meeting with the victims and thanking the firefighters for their valiant effort. 
Mr. President, I have lived in Florida for more than sixty-one years. 
In that time, I have never observed wildfires as widespread and unmanageable as those that have plagued our state for the last forty-four days. 
On behalf of over 14 million Floridians, I offer my deepest thanks to the thousands of Americans who have voluntarily left their homes and risked their lives so that our state's fire victims might not lose theirs. 
They are true heroes, and all of us who proudly call Florida our home are forever in their debt. 
Thank you, Mr. President.

Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise before you today to offer an amendment on behalf of myself and Senators Dorgan, Coverdell, Murray, and Hagel. I offer this amendment to correct an injustice in our current student financial aid policy. Since June 1 of 1987, the Montgomery GI bill has guaranteed basic educational assistance for most persons who are or have been members of the Armed Forces or the selected reserves for significant periods of time. 
This legislation was created in 1987 to achieve a number of important national objectives. It was to assist veterans in their readjustment to civilian life, to aid in the era of an all-volunteer military, in the recruitment and retention of qualified personnel in the Armed Forces, and to develop a more highly educated and productive workforce. 
Unfortunately, currently, the Montgomery GI benefits are considered `other financial aid' in the determination of a student's need. In other words, when a veteran applies for financial aid, colleges and universities are required to take into account any benefits received under the Montgomery GI bill program in arriving at a judgment as to what resources that student would be entitled to receive. 
The ultimate result is that the total financial aid award is substantially reduced.

<DOCNO>105-graham-fl-6-19980709</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, this penalty, which is currently subjected to veterans' benefits, does not apply to other analogous benefits. 
For instance, the current law states that those persons who receive benefits under the National Service Program Educational Award Program, which is generally known as the AmeriCorps Program, will not have their financial assistance treated as a deduction in their eligibility for other forms of student financial aid. 
In fact, Mr. President, the amendment I offer is an amendment to precisely that section of the law adding the Montgomery GI bill to the current exemption for AmeriCorps as the basis of calculating student financial aid. 
Mr. President, this unjust treatment of veterans' benefits has had a number of perverse affects. Although over 80 percent of persons in the military today are applying to become eligible for the Montgomery GI benefits--in fact, the latest statistics from the Department of Defense are that 94 percent of veterans are signing up for this program--less than 40 percent are actually using the program. And this discriminatory treatment is cited as a significant reason for that low level of utilization. It also is undercutting the ability of those who are attempting to recruit persons into the volunteer armed services by having to state that the real value of these benefits is substantially reduced and, therefore, this major inducement--in fact, the major inducement for many young people to come into the military--is diluted. 
Mr. President, I offer this amendment today, which has been costed at $85 million over the next 10 years by the Congressional Budget Office, and is offset by reducing accounts in the Secretary's discretionary fund as a step towards achieving the objectives that this Congress sought when it first adopted the Montgomery GI bill in 1987. 
Mr. President, our country has had a long experience, particularly the experience since the end of World War II, in encouraging returning veterans to continue their education. I believe that the GI bill of 1944 ranks with legislation that has already been referred to by the chairman of the committee, the Morrill Act, that established the Land Grant College system, and Social Security as premier examples of congressional legislation that has had a positive effect on our Nation. 
I urge the adoption of this amendment which will assure that the full benefits of the Montgomery GI bill, our current national statement of appreciation to those who have served in our armed services, that the injustice that is currently attached to that program be eliminated, and that the full benefits of the program be available to not only the veterans but to all Americans. 
Mr. President, that concludes my statement. If there are no other statements, I ask for the consideration of this amendment.

I thank Mr. Atwell. This is an example of a citizen with a legitimate concern who has made a difference in the lives of potentially many thousands of future veterans who will get the benefit of this removal of an injustice from our student financial aid program.

<TEXT>
Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I wish to express my appreciation to my colleague and good friend from Utah for his kind remarks, as well as for his excellent analysis of this legislation. I join him in the same enthusiastic reform of the Internal Revenue Service and see this as an important chapter in a longer book which will soon bring us to the pages of simplification of the Internal Revenue Code. 
Mr. President, this legislation does mark a new era for the Internal Revenue Service. The hearings that we had disclosed some of the culture of the IRS as it has operated in the past. We focused on how to change that cultural orientation. Let me just mention three areas that we uncovered. 
One was typical of many large organizations, public or private, and that is a loss of focus on the mission and a tendency to become too internal in the way in which issues were reviewed. That tendency to become incestuous, to answer questions based on what is in the best interests of the organization rather than what is in the best interests of the customers--in this case, the taxpayers served by the organization--is, unfortunately, a typical transformation and a transformation which we found that the IRS had succumbed to. The new IRS will begin to analyze issues from the perspective of their customers, the American taxpayers, and, with that new reorientation, will become more effective in carrying out its mission and will be seen by the taxpayers as being less intrusive in their lives. 
A second aspect of the old IRS was its evaluation of employees based on how much money was collected. This is analogous to a police department which requires its officers to issue so many parking tickets or speeding tickets per day. It changes the priorities, it changes the perspective, it changes the public respect of the organization. I am pleased that the new IRS will evaluate employees based on how they deal with taxpayers as well as on their collection efforts. 
A third factor in the old IRS was the tendency to threaten taxpayers with enforcement action if they didn't agree to extend terms of payment or enter into other measures that would make tax collection easier for the IRS. We had an example of this recently, in which the IRS--and I commend them for having come forward with this--became aware that there were threats being made to taxpayers who already had entered into a multiyear installment payment, where a portion of that installment payment would be beyond the statute of limitations, beyond the reach of the IRS. Taxpayers in that circumstance were being threatened that, if they did not agree to waive the statute of limitations, they would be subjected to immediate cancellation of their installment agreement and required to make full payment at that time. 
The IRS had uncovered that there were approximately 22,000 instances of that improper threat and are in the process of notification. I am pleased to say on June 29 of this year, in Tampa, FL, the first actual check of over $1,500 was paid to a taxpayer as a refund because of the consequences of such a threat. 
Mr. Carl Junstrom, who was the taxpayer receiving that refund, has become a hero of American taxpayers because of his efforts to overcome the travails to which he was subjected and now has become a symbol that individual taxpayers can prevail in their own cases and can benefit many thousands of others. 
One of the significant parts of this reform effort is that it was a grassroots-up effort. It was an effort that didn't start by Washington telling American taxpayers what their problems with the IRS were, but rather listening, understanding, and then being willing to act on what we had heard. 
This is in the best tradition of democracy. Many of these individual issues came to the attention of the IRS and to congressional offices through taxpayers who had specific problems with the IRS, and they brought them to the attention of a taxpayer advocate in the IRS or to their Member of Congress. 
That kind of information began to accumulate, and it was seen that the problems were not specific and focused, but rather began to disclose a pattern of IRS problems, a pattern of needs for taxpayers to have a new relationship with their tax collection agency. 
Those individual taxpayer concerns then became the focus of hearings that were held by the Senate Finance Committee and the House Ways and Means Committee. Some of those were held here in Washington; others were held across the Nation. In January of this year, I participated in such a hearing with Congresswoman Karen Thurman in Orlando, FL, in which we heard, again, some of the specifics of taxpayer concerns which had previously been the subject of specific constituent complaints. Let me just mention a couple of those. 
Karen Andreasen, from Hillsborough County, FL, when filing for divorce discovered that her soon-to-be ex-husband had failed to file tax returns for 1993 and 1994. She then found that the IRS, having launched its case against her ex-husband, swiftly turned its attention to her. Tax liens were placed on her home; the bank holding her mortgage threatened her with foreclosure. 
A separation or divorce is painful enough for both of the parties and the children and others who are affected, without suddenly realizing--like Karen Andreasen, a spouse who had placed confidence in her ex-husband and signed joint returns--they are subject to a deficit of thousands of dollars in back taxes on income they never earned and on tax returns that they never understood. 
Congress has now recognized the problem of Karen Andreasen and, in this legislation, we have provided that divorced or separated spouses can elect to be responsible for only their proportionate share of the taxes. 
We have also liberalized the circumstances under which other taxpayers may obtain innocent-spouse relief, and we have made this retroactive to currently opened cases so that Karen Andreasen and thousands of other spouses like her will be able to get the benefit of these new provisions. 
Thomas Jones was a decorated Naval veteran from Clearwater, FL. His business partner absconded with the company's payroll taxes. Mr. Jones did what a responsible citizen should do: He notified the authorities. IRS initially thanked him for his assistance, then proceeded to hold him 100 percent responsible for the partnership debt. Under pressure and unable to afford legal representation, Mr. Jones elected a monthly payment plan. 
When I met with him at an IRS reform hearing in Orlando, he told me that he was bankrupt. Interest and penalties were piling up at a staggering $2,000 a month. Twice during his 13-year-long fight, Thomas had offered to compromise with the IRS, but was summarily rejected by the same collection agent who a few days earlier had been bugging him for additional money. 
Good news. Thomas Jones may be the last taxpayer to suffer from such unfair conflict of interest, because this reform legislation expands the authority of the IRS to accept offers of compromise and guarantees to Americans an independent third party review of their offers and compromise. This will prevent the same IRS division from serving as prosecutor, judge, jury and executioner. 
Mr. President, those are just two examples of Americans with specific problems who now have contributed to relief for themselves and for thousands of current and future taxpayers. 
There are some lessons in this experience which I think we in Congress need to understand, appreciate and absorb into our future actions. 
First, much of our success, in addition to taking advantage of 
the experiences of individual Americans, was the result of an IRS reform commission which was established 2 years ago. I applaud Senator Grassley, who is with us this afternoon, and Senator Bob Kerrey, for the work they did on that IRS reform commission. That gave to us the basis of thoughtful recommendations and analyses which substantially accelerated the work of the Congress and the effectiveness of that work. 
This indicates to me that we need to commit ourselves as a Congress to ongoing oversight of the IRS; that we can't wait until there is an occasional commission formed to review this matter; that we must have an ongoing responsibility to see that this agency does not slip back into the patterns of conduct that necessitated the legislation that we will be adopting later today. 
Second, we must recognize that this is but a chapter in the larger book of how to make the Internal Revenue Code more understandable, more appropriate, more taxpayer friendly. I suggest that the next chapter, which will be simplification of the Tax Code, use some of these lessons that we have just learned. That it, too, take advantage of the experience of individual Americans in what they would like to see, based on their own experience, in a more simplified tax structure for America; that we look to the use of expert panels, such as the IRS reform commission, to help give us indepth advice and advance our ability to engage in this next step of simplification of the Tax Code. 
My own sense is that a third lesson learned is that Congress can make substantial steps if it does it in digestible increments. I suggest that as we look at the Internal Revenue Code we ask the question: What are the building blocks of the Internal Revenue Code? How can we take each of these blocks in turn and systematically have it reviewed based on taxpayer experience, based on expert review and then, finally, congressional hearings and congressional action? 
I believe if we take that digestible, incremental approach, in a reasonable period of time we will be able to say to the American people that we have reformed not only the administration, but also the Tax Code itself, and reformed it in a way that will make it more understandable and more acceptable to the American taxpayer. 
I conclude by applauding Senator Roth for his great leadership and Senator Moynihan in holding the hearings that first exposed the problems of the IRS. I urge that we continue our active involvement as we see that this legislation achieves its intended result and move to the next chapter of simplification of the Internal Revenue Code. 
Mr. President, this is a happy day. I will, with enthusiasm, join what I am confident will be a large majority of my colleagues in voting for this conference report which will move us substantially towards the goal of an IRS Code that all Americans, that all those affected by its administration, will feel prouder about as citizens and will make their task of compliance with their tax responsibilities somewhat easier. Thank you, Mr. President.

Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about an issue which is of vital importance to our nation's brave veterans and their families. 
The Montgomery GI bill, which was made permanent on June 1, 1987, guarantees basic educational assistance for most persons who are, or have been, members of the Armed Forces or the Selected Reserve for significant periods of time. 
The Montgomery GI bill was created to help veterans in their readjustment to civilian life, to aid in recruitment and retention of qualified personnel in the Armed Forces, and to develop a more highly educated and productive work force. 
Currently, Montgomery GI benefits are considered `other financial aid' in the determination of need. 
In other words, when a veteran applies for financial aid, colleges and universities are required to consider veterans' educational benefits as a resource when computing the financial award. 
The ultimate result is that the total financial aid award is reduced. 
This penalty does not exist for other Americans who serve our country. 
The National Community Service Act of 1990 decrees that a national service educational award or post-service benefit shall not be treated as financial assistance. 
Mr. President, this inequity is an affront to the many veterans who have sacrificed to defend our nation from harm. 
Today, I am introducing the Veterans Educational Benefits Protection Act of 1998 to prevent GI bill benefits from being considered a resource in the computation of financial aid. 
Let me read to you from a letter that I received from a Florida veteran. He writes: 
I do not think that VA education benefits should be calculated into the financial aid equation for two reasons. 
First, I paid for the Montgomery GI Bill, albeit only $1200, but more so with a sacrifice of time serving my country. 
I previously paid for these benefits and am currently being penalized for that through financial aid . . . I did not qualify for any type of federal educational grant this year in part because my veterans benefits were counted as financial aid in my package. 
It's ironic, Mr. President. 
We created the Montgomery GI bill to reward veterans for their dedication to the defense of our liberties. 
They earn its benefits through years of service and help to finance them through paycheck deduction. 
But current law unfairly penalizes the 94 percent of veterans who sign up for the program and the 40 percent who actually use the benefits to which they are entitled. 
Our bill will revoke this self-defeating approach and restore common sense to this important veterans educational program. 
If it is enacted, Montgomery GI bill benefits will no longer be treated as other financial assistance for purposes of the need analysis formula. 
This is a critical change. 
It is well-known and well-documented that education has a dramatic impact on earning potential and employment success. 
Employees with a college education are more likely to earn higher salaries--and less likely to become unemployed--than those workers who did not advance beyond high school. 
Even worse, failure to enact this legislation will harm our efforts to attract our best and brightest young people to the armed services. 
The Department of Defense has identified the Montgomery GI bill as its best available recruitment tool. 
Mr. President, just over fifty years ago, in 1945, tens of thousands of American servicemen returned home from defeating totalitarian aggression around the globe. 
Because Congress had enacted the original GI bill a year earlier, they arrived with the assurance that the federal government would reward their brave defense of freedom and heroic sacrifice with a chance for a better life. 
When Congress passed that first GI bill, it made a covenant with the men and women who put their lives on the line to protect our cherished freedom and democracy. 
By making it more difficult for veterans to finance higher education once they leave the armed services, current law has undermined that compact. 
I am confident that the Veterans Education Benefits Protection Act will help us reaffirm our commitment to these courageous Americans, and give veterans access to the higher education that they so richly deserve.

Does this provision jeopardize the 90.5 guarantee rate of return even if a State's gas tax revenues to the highway trust fund are to grow significantly over the life of the bill?

Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to ask for your attention to an issue of great importance to the future of science and space exploration: the International Space Station. We have debated the merits of this project on many occasions. It is time to end this debate and declare our permanent support. We must press ahead with mankind's exploration of the cosmos. 
President Franklin Roosevelt once said: 
The only limit to our realization of tomorrow will be our doubts of today. Let us move forward with strong and active faith. 
I ask my colleagues to embrace Franklin Roosevelt's vision and support efforts to move the International Space Station forward. 
The International Space Station is one of the most promising space projects in history. Over 60 percent of the station hardware, nearly half a million pounds, will be assembled by the end of this year. More than 75 percent of the developmental activities are completed. The end result of this 16-nation effort will be an international university in low-earth orbit and a launching pad for further exploration of the stars. 
Mr. President, constructing this space station will not be simple or cheap. But why would we expect it to be? For the first time in the history of manned space exploration, we are assembling a laboratory, energy plant, and apartment complex the size of a football field in orbit 200 miles above the Earth. This is an ambitious technical feat. 
Our nation's exploration of the galaxy has never been easy. While we prefer to remember glorious moments like our distinguished colleague John Glenn's first orbit, Neil Armstrong's first moon landing, and the majestic first launch of the space shuttle, we should not forget that America's four decade adventure in space has also been plagued by technical difficulties and political struggles. We've faced tragedies--namely the three brave astronauts who lost their lives in the Apollo I fire, and the seven others who perished on the Challenger. Space exploration has been exciting, but it has never been easy. 
But perseverance and patience have powered our space program past these difficulties, and they will be necessary ingredients in our effort to construct and maintain this International Space Station. Without the perseverance and patience of early space pioneers, we might not have been the first nation to land on the moon or successfully operate a reusable launch vehicle. 
The International Space Station will excite the nation and the world. I cannot imagine any other project that will so readily inspire young people across our country to focus their attention on math and science. The first launch of space station components will cultivate the next generation of mechanical engineers, software designers, flight controllers, and of course, our astronaut corps. Throughout its lifetime, the space station will include student experiments and teleconferencing and telescience projects. 
For this investment, we will have a permanent facility in space in which we can conduct numerous scientific and medical experiments, the end results possibly being cures for diseases known and unknown. 
For instance, space-grown insulin crystals created in a microgravity environment are larger and better defined than those developed on Earth. Scientists from NASA and the pharmaceutical industry hope to develop drugs that will bind insulin and attack the third leading cause of death in this country, diabetes. 
Microgravity can also be used to study proteins and three-dimensional tissue samples. Previous success in advanced cell-culturing has led to partnerships with the National Institutes of Health in the study of transmission of the AIDS virus. This application of space technology has also led to new studies of cancer tumors. 
Space flight is particularly applicable to studying the aging process, since astronauts experience many of the same symptoms seen in the elderly, such as anemia, loss of muscle, and imbalance. Women are five times more likely to suffer from osteoporosis, the medical term for weakening bones. What better way to study it than to simulate it in space? The results could be fewer broken bones in the years to come as baby boomers advance in age. 
In addition to the tremendous health benefits we will reap from medical studies on the space station, our daily lives will be affected by numerous spin-offs and product developments. Aerogel is the lightest known solid, only three times heavier than air. Space-manufactured samples are four times better in quality than any produced on earth, allowing for the creation of superinsulators. Fortune magazine predicts the aerogel market could result in 800 potential product lines, from satellite parts to surfboard material. 
Finally, as demonstrated by the devastating Florida fires, combustion represents a threat in many forms. Fires cause 5,000 deaths and $26 billion in property losses every year, a figure I am certain will be higher due to the terrible losses we have suffered in Florida. How can a space station help? In space, researchers can study flames without the interference of the earth's gravity. Such studies will help us better understand how combustion happens and better address problems such as air pollution and forest fires. 
The House and Senate share a vision for the future of space and we must continue to act together on behalf of this visionary project. The future will soon be upon us. We don't want to see it pass us by. I urge my colleagues to vote against this amendment and endorse the International Space Station. We must not let the doubts of today stand in the way of the possibilities of tomorrow.

Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I would like to commend the efforts of the conferees of the Child Support Performance and Incentive Act of 1998 for the hard work they have done to secure passage of child support reform legislation. The legislation that has passed the House and Senate represents a significant victory for children who are getting the support they need from both parents. I am pleased that the conferees accepted a provision offered by Senator Grassley and I to further enhance the states' efforts along with banks to streamline the matching process that is required to gather financial information to support our children. 
The changes we have proposed through this provision will allow the Federal Parent Locator Service to aid our State agencies in their collection efforts. Financial institutions doing business in two or more States would be able to use the Federal Parent Locator Service to assist them in matching data for child support enforcement purposes. The language included in this provision will provide a structure for a centralized and coordinated matching process, thereby streamlining data matches for the financial institutions and state child support enforcement programs. We believe that such measures will prevent the duplication of efforts by states and banks and assist us in the ultimate aim of getting more money to more children more quickly.

Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I am here today to introduce an amendment to the Defense Authorization bill which is now before us. But first, I would like to congratulate the members of the Armed Services Committee for the excellent work they have done in preparing this legislation. I know they are being asked to do more and more with less and less, and they are having to make some very tough choices. The Committee has done an outstanding job and they deserve to be commended for it. 
I would also like to pay special tribute to the Chairman, Senator Thurmond, who is managing this legislation for the final time. His record of service to this country is remarkable. It is symbolic of the greatness of this country that this paratrooper who landed in Normandy on D-Day, who fought the tyranny of Nazi Germany and saw it defeated, fought the tyranny of the Stalinist Soviet Union and saw it defeated, rose to the Senate of our great nation and then to become Chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee. His experience and commitment to our national security has strengthened democracy and peace here and abroad. We all owe a great debt of gratitude to this great American. 
Mr. President, defense spending has declined for the last 14 years, and is now at the lowest point as a percentage of GDP since before the Second World War. We have decreased military personnel by 39% since the end of the Cold War. I supported these reductions during the time that I was privileged to serve on the Armed Services Committee. At that time, the federal budget deficit was spiraling out of control and balancing the budget was one of my highest priorities. 
I think the pendulum may be beginning to swing the other way. We now expect to realize a significant budget surplus this year, perhaps more than $50 billion. In light of this, it may be appropriate to review the limits we have set on defense spending so that we can halt the annual decreases in defense spending. Even holding the defense budget constant in real terms would make a significant difference to all those who serve in our armed forces. 
I know that my colleagues Senator Stevens and Senator Dominici share this concern. It has been reported that Navy Secretary Dalton believes that the Navy cannot afford to both modernize and recapitalize our naval forces within current fiscal guidance, placing readiness at significant risk. I would urge all of my colleagues to recognize the great strain we are placing on our soldiers, sailors, airmen and marines as we continually ask them to do more while providing them with less. 
I now would like to turn to an amendment that I have introduced, together with Senator Bennett, which deals with the Y2K problem. I understand that this amendment will be accepted by both the majority and the minority, and I would like to thank both sides for their assistance in finding a formulation which is acceptable to both sides. 
We now are undertaking a massive effort to deal with this problem within the U.S. Government. The Defense Department alone has over 2800 critical systems that must be `cured.' The Russians, however, have not yet determined if they have a similar problem, let alone begun to fix it. 
Given the potential impact of such a problem on military weapons systems, it is in our national interest to work with Russia, and other nations with similar problem, to help them identify the scope of their Y2K problem in strategic systems and to fix it. Our amendment authorizes the Secretary of Defense to enter into cooperative agreements with foreign governments to assist them in identifying and correcting their Y2K problems in strategic and communications systems that would otherwise threaten the national security interests of the United States. 
It would be detrimental to our interests if the Russians awoke on the morning of January 1, 2000, with blank screens on their early warning radars and command and control systems. What would be even worse is if their critical systems continued to operate with false and corrupted information. It is in both U.S. and Russian interests for our countries to maintain the highest level of confidence in our command and control systems. We must build this confidence through transparency and other cooperative measures. The recent nuclear escalation on the Indian subcontinent demonstrates the importance of mutual trust and confidence, and the danger and instability that can result when uncertainty and miscalculation arise. Assisting the Russians with their Y2K problem is an example of cooperation that will enhance both Russian and U.S. national security.

 Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, today with my good friend and colleague Senator Mack I introduce the `Florida Coast Protection Act'. This legislation will protect Florida's fragile coastline from outer continental shelf leasing and drilling in three important ways. 
First, it transforms the annual moratorium on leasing and preleasing activity off the coast of Florida into a permanent ban covering Planning Areas in the Eastern Gulf of Mexico, the Straits of Florida, and the South Atlantic Planning Area. 
Second, it raises the bar for approval of development and production requests on existing leases off the coast of Florida. It establishes a Joint Federal-State Outer Continental Shelf Task Force comprised of experts from the Environmental Protection Agency, the Minerals Management Service, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the Fish and Wildlife Service, the National Marine Fisheries Service, the Biological Resources Division of the United States Geological Survey, state representatives, and professional scientist nominated by the National Academy of Sciences. This Joint Task Force will ensure that all data required to make a determination of the environmental and economic effects of oil and gas production and development on local communities is available to the Secretary of Interior and the State of Florida. 
Third, the Florida Coast Protection Act corrects an egregious conflict in regulatory provisions where an affected state is required to make a consistency determination for proposed oil and gas production or development under the Coastal Zone Management Act prior to receiving the Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) from the Mineral Management Service. Our bill requires that the EIS is provided to affected states six months before they make a consistency determination. 
Mr. President, you may recall that we introduced similar legislation under the same title in June of 1997. The focus of that bill was the cancellation of the lease tract 17 miles off the coast of Pensacola, resulting in the elimination of six oil and gas leases. Since that time, these leases were relinquished by the Mobil Corporation back to the control of the U.S. Department of the Interior. In addition, these areas are covered by the moratorium on leasing in the Eastern Gulf--a protection that President Clinton recently extended through 2012 as part of the Year of the Ocean efforts to protect this extremely valuable natural resource. 
What would this bill mean for Florida? The elimination of preleasing activity and lease sales off the coast of Florida protects our economic and environmental future. 
In 1997, over 47 million tourists visited Florida, spending $41 billion. The five western 
counties of the Florida Panhandle brought in over $8 million from tourist development tax in 1996. Three cities in this area--Panama City, Pensacola, and Fort Walton Beach--recorded over $1.5 billion in tourism and recreation taxable sales during the same period. 
It is home to some of the richest estuarine areas in the world. These habitats provide an irreplaceable link in the life cycle of both marine and terrestrial species. Florida's commercial fishing industry relies heavily on these estuaries as they support the nurseries for most commercially harvested fish. In addition, nearly 90 percent of the reef fish resources in the Gulf of Mexico are caught on the West Florida Shelf. 
Mr. President, the environmental and economic value of this area is evidenced by the many state and federal land holdings in designated environmental preservation, conservation, and recreation areas. Fifty of these areas are located along 175 miles of coastline in the Florida Panhandle. 
In testimony before the House Resources Subcommittee on Energy and Mineral Resources on May 14, 1998, Florida Governor Lawton Chiles provided the following perspective on the potential damage to Florida's coastline that could be caused by offshore drilling. He said that `oil spills remain the most visible . . . however, there are other detrimental environmental effects that these activities could have on the shallow, clean water marine communities found on the Florida outer continental shelf . . . [including] . . . physical disturbances caused by anchoring, pipeline placement and rig construction, the resuspension of bottom sediments, and the chronic pollution from discharges of drilling effluents, production effluents, and possible accidental releases of oil or other toxic material . . .' 
Throughout my time in the Senate, I have opposed offshore oil drilling off the coast of Florida because of the threat it presents to the state's greatest natural and economic resource--our coastal environment. With my colleagues in the Florida delegation, I have worked successfully to obtain moratoria on additional leasing off the west Florida coast. With the passage of the Florida Coast Protection Act, this annual moratoria will evolve into permanent protection for the Florida coastline. 
The Florida Coast Protection Act is a milestone in our attempts to protect our natural coastal resources in the State of Florida and throughout the nation. I urge my colleagues to support this effort.

Mr. GRAHAM. Thank you, Mr. President. 
Mr. President, I supported this bill when it passed the Senate several weeks ago. And I regretfully rise to oppose this conference report. As has been said by several of the speakers, there are many positive elements in this legislation. I am particularly supportive of those, for instance, which will make it easier for families to plan and prepare for the college/university education of their children and family members through things like the education savings account and the prepaid college tuition plans which Florida and several other States have established. Those are all positives. 
When I face legislation at the final vote, there are two questions that I ask of myself. One is, Is this legislation better than the status quo? And, second, If it is better than the status quo, is it sufficiently an improvement to justify the investment of public attention, political energy, and the likelihood that, should this become law, it will be considered this Congress' final statement on this subject? 
I find this bill, as it returned from the conference committee, to fail to meet that test. I think this bill is too minimalist in terms of its capacity to identify those major challenges that face this Nation, in terms of education, and to construct an appropriate Federal policy to move us forward in an area that will probably, more than any other, determine our Nation's status into the 21st century--the education of our people. 
I believe that this legislation in the conference committee lost its focus. It did not return with the balance that it had when it left this Chamber. I am particularly concerned about the issue of school construction. 
Admittedly, I come from a State which has experienced a dramatic increase both in new students entering our school system--40,000 to 50,000 new students every year entering the public schools of Florida--and a State which is reaching a point of maturity where many of its older schools are requiring substantial rehabilitation. And almost all of our schools require the new technologies to bring them up to current standards of educational modernity. 
In this legislation, as it left the Senate several weeks ago, there was what I thought was a creative provision, which received broad support in the Senate, which would have encouraged public-private partnerships in the construction and rehabilitation of schools. It would have used a financing 
technique, called private facility bonds, which has been used effectively in areas such as water and sewer, transportation, and housing for public school construction. 
Ironically, a provision almost identical in final impact to what was contained in the Senate version is now being used for private elementary and secondary construction. But for reasons which are inexplicable to me, the conference dropped that provision and therefore will deny, through the Federal Tax Code incentives, the opportunity for many school districts that are facing enormous pressures to be able to utilize that technique as a means of building and rehabilitating schools. 
I hope that when we come back to this issue--and that hope is that we will return before this Congress adjourns--that the central role of adequate school facilities in achieving adequate education, and the role which the Federal Government can play creatively in helping us provide those adequate physical facilities, will be reexamined. 
I am also concerned, Mr. President, as to a provision which was dropped at the front door but seems to have reentered at the back door relative to block grants for Federal education. 
Since the 1960s, the Federal Government has focused its attention on education in three primary areas: One, civil rights; two, the at-risk student, whether that was a handicapped student, a student from a disadvantaged background, or other factors which made that student a greater educational risk and generally a more expensive student to educate than the general student population; and, third, access to higher education through a variety of Federal grants and loans. 
There was a provision which many of us objected to which would have provided that those carefully crafted, long-standing pillars of Federal education policy would be collapsed into block grants. I am pleased that that attack through the front door was dropped. But I am concerned that there still is in this legislation an attack through the back door. 
I bring your attention to page 12 of the report which outlines the legislation. And under the category of `State Incentives For Teacher Testing And Merit Pay,' the first section talks about State incentives through a grant program for teacher testing and merit pay. 
I would like to say, as an aside, personally, while I was a member of the Florida State legislature, and later as Governor, I supported concepts of teacher testing, both upon entry into the profession and while in the profession. And we established what we called a career ladder, which was a form of recognition of the superior teacher. So I am, as a matter of policy, inclined to support the principles. 
But what concerns me is a provision that says, under paragraph (e), `Notwithstanding any other provision of law, a State may use Federal education funds--to carry out [these two purposes of teacher testing and establishing a merit pay program for teachers].' 
As I read this, what we are saying is that we have returned to this concept of a block grant by saying that a State, without any other constraints, because `notwithstanding any other provision of law'--it is not limited to elementary, secondary funds, but all education funds--vocational funds, higher education funds, elementary, secondary funds, maybe even funds for specialized programs such as veterans educational benefits--that a State can collapse all of those funds into a block grant for the purposes of teacher testing and establishment of a merit pay plan. I think that is a very bad educational policy and, in and of itself, makes this conference report unacceptable. 
So, Mr. President, I reluctantly will oppose this legislation. I do so in the hope that when the President has exercised his stated intention to veto this legislation, and we are back to ground zero with what should the Congress do relative to a Federal role in enhancing our Nation's educational opportunities for its children and for its adults, that we will come back to this task with a new spirit of bipartisanship, with a commitment to a clear diagnosis of what are the principal shortfalls in our education system, and what the Federal role should be in attempting to overcome those deficiencies. 
There is no task more important to our Nation, as we face a new century, than a renewed commitment to education. It will be the key to our ability, in an increasingly globalized economy, to be able to maintain the American standard of living while we are also competitive in the world economy. 
The only means by which we will do so will be to assure that each American is as fully prepared to be as productive and as contributing towards our total economy and our total society as they can be because we have given them the opportunity of the best possible education. 
Mr. President, again, I regret that we are not able to move forward with this legislation today, but I commend the Senator from Georgia for his very genuine interest and his leadership in this area, and hope that leadership will soon be rewarded. Thank you. 
Several Senators addressed the Chair.

Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, at this point in the debate, it is appropriate to ask one very simple question: Why are we here? Why have Members of the Senate spent months of their time focusing on this issue? Why, with a busy schedule, and few legislative days left this year, are we occupying the Senate's time with this bill? 
The answer to this question is equally simple--the most important thing the Senate can do this year is to make significant inroads in cutting youth smoking. 
If you accept this simple premise--that the goal of a tobacco bill should be about reducing teen smoking, then the decision on how to vote on the Coverdell amendment is clear. The amendment should be opposed. 
Mr. President, let me be perfectly clear. I support increased appropriations for drug enforcement and drug interdiction. I represent a State that has experienced major crises related to drug trafficking and drug use. And I know better than most, as a member of the Senate Caucus on International Narcotics Control, the importance of fighting the scourge of drugs in America. 
Last year, I joined my House colleague and fellow Floridian John Mica in establishing a new High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area in Central Florida. I was also an original co-sponsor of the Drug Free Communities Act. I have co-sponsored a bill with Senator Grassley that will establish a national strategy to attack money laundering. I have fought to increase funding for our counternarcotics efforts time and time again. 
Just next week I will be holding a field hearing in Miami on the current interdiction efforts in the Caribbean. I know how serious the drug threat is, and I have been and will be committed to doing whatever it takes to keep drugs away from our children. 
I support many of the measures in the Coverdell amendment. And if the United States Senate ever gets serious about addressing this issue, perhaps funding these measures through general revenues, I would support them wholeheartedly. 
In fact, we will have an opportunity to vote on an alternative which addresses the drug problem by authorizing funds to increases the number of border patrol agents, Coast Guard officers, and money for the Department of Defense to increase interdiction. And we will be able to augment these programs without gutting anti-tobacco efforts. 
Mr. President, let's stay focussed, stick to the purpose, and send a message to parents right now that we are serious about reducing teen smoking. 
If we adopt the Coverdell amendment, here's what happens: five million smokers will not receive smoking cessation services. Those who argue that the tobacco taxes are regressive should remember that cessation and other public health programs are targeted toward helping those who will actually pay the tax. 
Over 20 million children will not receive the benefits of effective counter advertising to discourage them from taking up the deadly habit of cigarette smoking. 
Fifty million children will not participate in school-based prevention programs. 
States will not have the funds to develop their own anti-smoking programs which are so vital in protecting our children. 
We will not have the benefit of future biomedical advancement through increased funding for NIH research. 
In addition, we have solid scientific evidence to suggest that if we stop kids from smoking, they may never take up the use of illicit drugs, such as cocaine and marijuana. This `gateway effect' has been well documented. 
Let's look at the findings of the Surgeon General's 1994 report, `Preventing Tobacco Use Among Young People'--ninety-eight percent of all cocaine users smoked cigarettes first. 
Among 12 to 17 year olds--those who smoke are 114 times more likely to use marijuana and 32 times more likely to use cocaine. 
By contrast, less than one percent of those children who never smoked end up using cocaine or marijuana. 
Mr. President, if we are interested in cutting drug use among our children, we should pass this tobacco bill now, and leave the funding to States and public health intact, and then come back and fund the real anti-drug initiatives in the Coverdell proposal and the Democratic alternative amendment. There is simply no reason why we cannot and should not do both. Our kids are worth it. 
This is simply the greatest opportunity, and perhaps our only opportunity to take a huge step toward reducing youth smoking. This bill is our best chance to have a significant impact on the Nation's public health. We shouldn't blow it. 
Mr. President, those who attempt to gut this bill through funding extraneous programs--are going to be on the wrong side of history. For all of these reasons, I urge the rejection of the Coverdell amendment. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I look forward at the appropriate time to discuss the amendment of the Senator from Georgia because I agree with his premise that there is a relationship between tobacco smoking and the use of drugs. I have spent a great deal of my time in public office trying to increase our ability to deal with illicit use of drugs, both in terms of effective enforcement at all levels of government and those things that will reduce the likelihood of persons desiring to use drugs. 
Let me say the most fundamental relationship between the tobacco issue that we debate today and the amendment of the Senator from Georgia is that virtually no one starts with the use of illicit drugs. Tobacco is the gateway to the use of illicit drugs. So our ability, by effective legislation or otherwise, to substantially reduce the number of persons who commence the process of experimentation, use and then addiction to tobacco will make one of, if not the most, fundamental contributions to the reduction of the use of illicit hard drugs. 
That is an issue that we will have an opportunity to discuss in more detail later. 
My concern today is a series of ads that are being run, ads that are being run either under the specific sponsorship of the tobacco industry or by organizations which we know are supported by the tobacco industry. 
Typical of these ads is one in which there is a lady, a waitress who is looking into a television camera and is stating how much her cost of smoking will increase if legislation such as that proposed by the Senate Commerce Committee were to become the law. 
There are other ads that make the same point through other appealing messages. There is a fundamental error in those ads. There is a fundamental deception. There is the latest example of the manipulation for which this industry has become so well known. What is that error? What is that fraud? What is that manipulation? It is the assumption that the status quo is an option. It is the assumption that we can roll back the events of the last several years and go back to 1970 and everything will be as it was then; that that lady in the ad will not be threatened with the possibility of higher prices for her cigarettes. 
The fact is that the status quo is not an option. There are two basic options that are before us as we continue this debate, and I think that it is important that we reassert what our real alternatives are. 
Our alternatives are either comprehensive, and I believe as Senator Chafee and Senator Harkin and I have believed for many months, that it also must be bipartisan, health-oriented national legislation. That is one alternative. 
The other alternative is not the status quo. The other alternative is a continuation of the pattern of State-by-State litigation, a pattern which has already increased the price of cigarettes in America between 17 to 20 cents per pack to pay for the settlements that have been reached thus far in only four States--Mississippi, Florida, Texas and Minnesota. 
It is projected that if the increase in cigarettes that will be a result of the other 46 States successfully pursuing litigation against the tobacco industry is at the same per capita level as these first four States, Mr. President, that the cost per pack will go up by an additional dollar or to a level higher than that which is being proposed by the Senate Commerce Committee. 
So the option that we have is not one of whether there is going to be an increase in the price of cigarettes; the question is whether it will come through a comprehensive, bipartisan, health-oriented national legislation, or whether it will come by a series of State-by-State litigations augmented by the kinds of litigations that are now being brought by Blue Cross-Blue Shield as an example of insurance carrier litigation, being brought by labor unions on behalf of their members and, Mr. President, I believe eventually will be brought by the Federal Government to secure its appropriate compensation for the additional cost that it has paid for tobacco-related illnesses through programs such as Medicare, the Veterans' Administration, CHAMPUS--the health care program for military personnel and their dependents--and a variety of other programs in which the Federal Government is either the total or a substantial contributor to their financing. 
The choice is either we do this through comprehensive, bipartisan, health-oriented national legislation, or it occurs on a State-by-State, litigation-by-litigation basis. 
My personal feeling is that by every criteria that we have used to assess what is the public interest, that the public interest would be better served by a comprehensive, bipartisan, health-oriented national legislation. 
What are some of those interests? Our most fundamental interest, the issue that has brought us here today and for the last several days and will for several more to come, has been our concern over teenage smoking. We know that every day 3,000 American youth, under the age of 18, commence the process that will eventually lead to the regular use of tobacco. We know that of that 3,000, that a third--1,000--will become so addicted to tobacco that they will die, that they will die prematurely of a tobacco-related affliction. 
That is the fundamental objective of this legislation, to reduce this unnecessary carnage of America's youth and adult population because of the continuation of a youthful introduction to tobacco. 
Which of the two approaches is most likely to achieve the objective of reducing youth smoking? We know some things, Mr. President, as to what is the effective combination of initiatives. We know that the most effective plan will be a broad-based, comprehensive public health-oriented plan. It will include items such as the funding of smoking cessation programs and the funding of education programs on the consequences of the use of tobacco. It will include limitations on marketing and promotion. It will include penalties against the industry and individual companies which fail to meet national standards for the reduction of teenage smoking. It will include, and probably most significantly, a substantial increase in the price of cigarettes, because it is that increase in price that will have the greatest deterrent effect on the use of cigarettes. 
The Centers for Disease Control has estimated that in the initial stages of an increase in price, that for every 10-percent increase in price, there is a 7-percent reduction in use. Those relationships begin to change as you reach higher levels of price increases. But the legislation that the Senator from Arizona has presented to us is projected to have, by the price alone, a reduction in teenage use of in the range of 40 to 50 percent. 
It is also important, Mr. President, that that price be instituted on a shock basis. If the price increase is gradual, incremental, drop by drop, then it is more likely to be absorbed, become the norm, and set the foundation for acceptance of the next increase. But if that price increase is dramatic--is imposed quickly--it will have the greatest affect in terms of achieving our objective of reducing teenage smoking. 
It is obvious that on all of those counts, comprehensive, bipartisan, public health-oriented national legislation will better achieve our objective of reducing teenage smoking than will the pattern of State by State, litigant by litigant courtroom action that will be the alternative to a national, comprehensive, bipartisan public health-oriented resolution of this issue. 
On the standard of enforcement, much is made in these ads that the tobacco industry is promoting that there will be a burgeoning of black-market sales if there is a substantial increase in the price. The fact is that by a legislative settlement--which among other things will provide the funds for those areas of enhanced enforcement that may be necessary, a national settlement that can contain provisions for strengthening our enforcement, a national settlement that will result in less variation State to State in terms of the price of cigarettes, and therefore less likelihood of black-market sales domestically within the United States--that a national 
legislative settlement will reduce the potential of black-market activities to a substantially greater degree than the alternative of State-by-State litigation. 
We also know that, on the issue of tobacco farmers, there is great recognition of the necessity to provide some transition. That transition is contained in every serious piece of legislation that has been introduced in the national Congress. 
There will be a debate over which of those alternatives is preferred, but the fact that it is a recognized part of a national, comprehensive, bipartisan health-oriented tobacco resolution is unanimously agreed to. But, Mr. President, that has not been included in the State-by-State settlements, and will not likely be included. Only a relatively small number of States are directly affected by the issue of tobacco farmers and, therefore, could not be expected to include, in their settlements with the tobacco industry, funding for tobacco farmers. 
If there is going to be a transition, it has to be done at the national level, not at a State-by-State level. So the interest of that constituency and that important part of this overall complex issue will be much better served by national legislation than they will be by a State-by-State settlement. 
Finally, having a rational distribution of the funds, yes, this is going to raise a substantial amount of money. It may raise more money on the State-by-State basis, it may impose higher costs on the industry, and eventually on the users of this product than national legislation, but in either event there will be a substantial amount of funds raised by either national legislation or by State-by-State litigation. But it is at the national level that we will have a better likelihood of being able to allocate the funds to important programs, such as research in our national health institutes so that we will learn more about the consequences of past tobacco use and an effective means of avoiding such use in the future. 
It is less likely that the States will be equitably treated through a series of State-by-State matters as opposed to doing it on a national basis. There will not be the funds likely to be available for effective counteradvertising, which will require a national program just as the national program that the Federal Government is now underwriting as it relates to advertising against the use of illicit drugs. 
So, Mr. President, based on our principal objective, which is the reduction of youth smoking, and other important subissues of this current effort, including appropriate use of the funds, enforcement against black marketing, the effect on tobacco farmers, it is much more likely that we will achieve our objectives through a national legislative settlement than what is the real alternative, which is for us to do nothing and then allow the course of action which is already in place, State by State, private, soon to be, I hope, Federal litigation against the tobacco industries to be the alternative. 
So, Mr. President, as we conclude this week's debate, I hope as we return next week we will be prepared to focus on what the real options are and get the business of America done and stop the carnage of American children that is resulting every hour we delay in this effort to mitigate the carnage of American youth that occurs as they take up the use of tobacco.

Mr. GRAHAM. Senator, I agree with your statement. We have one principal objective with this legislation, and that is to reduce teenage smoking, to reduce this unconscionable level of death and damage that is inflicted upon our young people by their early addiction to tobacco. 
There are other issues that are being suggested--from reforming the tax law to an enhanced enforcement effort against illicit drugs--which are all important issues, and many of us have supported and advocated and led the charge on those issues on other days and in other forums. 
Our concern is--and I will not impugn the motives of any of the advocates of those other provisions--that some outside, and maybe a few inside, this Chamber would be pleased at the objection of these `tantalizing but extraneous issues' because they would see them as a means of delay, obfuscation, and, eventually, defeat of comprehensive national legislation. 
What stuns me is that they don't also see what the alternative is. The alternative is not that defeat here will mean the American public will throw up its hands and say, `I guess we have to accept the fact that 125 American young people will take up smoking every hour of every day of the 365 days of the year.' That will not be the alternative. The alternative will be that the American public, having disdained of our ability to deal with this problem, will go to their States, will go to their labor unions, will urge their insurance carriers to enter the fray, as they have in other States, and we will have a 50-State shootout in the courts on this issue. 
We will move toward our objective, but not nearly as effectively as if we accept the responsibility and the opportunity to probably make the greatest contribution to the enhancement of public health of Americans that has occurred in this century by the adoption of this legislation.

Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I appreciate this opportunity. I strongly support the Nuclear Waste Policy Act. As the Senator from Alaska just stated, I was one of the 65 Senators who voted for it when we last passed it. I think it is very important that we pass a Nuclear Waste Policy Act as part of a national effort to assure that nuclear energy will continue to play a significant part in America's energy future. This importance is underscored by the contribution which nuclear energy can make to the United States meeting its global warming commitments without incurring major economic disruption in the rest of our economy. 
I am concerned, however, Mr. President, that I do not believe what we are about this afternoon is serious legislation but, rather, is a subterfuge. If I felt that by invoking cloture today and then passing it today or tomorrow we would move toward the adoption of the National Waste Policy Act, I would be a strong supporter. But the Speaker of the House, through a statement of an honorable Member of the House, has indicated that it is not his intention to take this legislation up in the House of Representatives. Therefore, unless we are willing to adopt precisely what the House has submitted and send it directly to the President for signature, any amendment that we might consider would have the effect of dooming this legislation. 
I am also concerned, Mr. President, that the effect of this would not only be to send the Nuclear Waste Policy Act to sure death in the House of Representatives, but it would also kill the tobacco bill here in the U.S. Senate. Without a unanimous consent agreement that assures that we would return immediately to the tobacco legislation, I am unwilling to take the risk of removing it as the business before the Senate and substituting the Nuclear Waste Policy Act, as much as I support that legislation. 
So for those reasons, I will vote against invoking cloture.

 Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, as the senior Senator from the state that launched the Mercury astronaut pioneers into space, sent Apollo astronauts to the moon, and has hosted numerous space shuttle launches since 1981, it is a tremendous privilege to lead the U.S. Senate in recognizing May 21 as `International Space Day.' 
Our nation's exciting adventure in space began just over forty years ago, with the launch of the Explorer I satellite on January 31, 1958. The celebration of this anniversary gave us cause to look back at America's four decades in space. `International Space Day' gives us a chance to look forward and assess how to seize the space opportunities of the future. 
Mr. President, forty years after we launched our first satellite and nearly thirty years since Neil Armstrong took mankind's first steps on the lunar surface, Americans remain captivated by the exploration of space. 
Students across the nation eagerly study past achievements and future adventures in space exploration. In Florida, tourists flock to the Kennedy Space Center on Cape Canaveral to see the famed launch pads and rockets that have boosted man into space. Right here in Washington, the National Air and Space Museum, National Space Society, and the aerospace industry have put space right on Congress' doorstep. 
`International Space Day' is an appropriate occasion to reflect on how our exploration and utilization of space dramatically affects our day-to-day lives. It is especially timely this week, when the breakdown of the Galaxy Four satellite has wreaked havoc in our nation's telecommunications sector. Many of us have constituents who were unable to listen to National Public Radio's reports on this week's floor debate on comprehensive tobacco legislation. Thousands of Americans have been inconvenienced because their pagers do not work. Doctors, businesses, television viewers and radio listeners--virtually everyone in our society--have been affected. 
Relatively few Americans have had the opportunity to escape the Earth's atmosphere and gravity, but space affects all of us. Galaxy Four is just one example of how critical the utilization of space is to our economy. We are on the brink of a new frontier in commercial space activity, with almost weekly launches of new communications satellites and the most competitive space launch market in decades. 
In 1998, the Senate will have a unique opportunity to remove barriers that impede U.S. companies in the exploration of this new frontier. U.S. Senator Connie Mack and I introduced the Commercial Space Act in the Senate last fall and we hope to see it passed soon. 
Mr. President, this is an exciting time to be discussing space issues in the U.S. Congress. At NASA's Kennedy Space Center--the nation's premiere launch base--the space shuttle continues to faithfully serve our manned space program. An international team of engineers and astronauts is assembling a new space station. In 1997 and early 1998, the Mars Pathfinder blazed a four-wheel drive trail on the Red Planet and the launch of the Lunar Prospector marked our return to the moon. In October, my colleague John Glenn of Ohio will return to space after thirty-seven years on Earth. VentureStar is under development as our nation's space vehicle of the future. And space tourism--featuring space planes that operate from traditional airports--is becoming more and more of a likelihood. 
I hope these developments inspire young Americans to develop the science, math, and engineering expertise that our nation needs to maintain its leadership in space. Congress should encourage efforts like that of the U.S. Space Foundation's Mission Home, a program that brings together space societies and aerospace companies to educate communities all over the nation about our exciting future in space. 
Mr. President, Disneyland will rededicate its Tomorrowland on Friday--forty-three years after it first inspired young adventurers to aim beyond the stratosphere. I will depend on all 100 members of this legislative body to help make sure that the United States is actively preparing for its tommorowland by keeping our nation on the forefront of the exploration, utilization, and commercialization of space today. Working together, we can ensure that every day is space day in the U.S. Senate.

Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, we have just been subjected in the U.S. Senate to what I think could appropriately be described as a filibuster--4 hours of wandering discussion on an amendment that is now before the Senate. 
During those 4 hours of that filibuster, 500 American youth under the age of 18 commenced their first use of tobacco products. One-third of those 500 American youth during that 4-hour filibuster who started to use tobacco will die, die prematurely of a tobacco-related affliction. 
I have heard as I walked through the Chamber during this 4 hours mocking comments: Does anybody believe that we are really here to try to reduce teenage smoking? Does anybody really feel we are here to reduce teenage smoking? The answer is yes, we are here to reduce teenage smoking. That is the only legitimate reason that we can be here. Anyone who does not start their debate by a clear statement of their commitment to that objective has debased this national debate about the future of tobacco and the youth of America. 
In 4 hours, 500 American youth have taken up smoking. Since May 20 of 1997, 1 year ago, the number is 1,095,000 American youth under the age of 18 have taken up the use of tobacco, and 365,000 of those American youth who have taken up tobacco in the last 1 year will die prematurely of a tobacco-related affliction. It is to them that this debate is directed. 
Mr. President, the best public health advisers available to us have recommended that we set as a goal a 65-percent reduction in teenage smoking over the next 10 years. That is a challenging goal, but it is an attainable goal. It is a goal which is going to stretch us in the political community. It is going to stretch those in the health, the education, and especially the families of America to their best in terms of beginning to attack this scourge which, as my colleague from Rhode Island has just indicated, is a growing scourge of teenage smoking. 
I believe that an important part of achieving that goal of a 65-percent reduction is to raise the price of cigarettes to as high a level as can be achieved without inducing other negative consequences, and to do that as quickly as possible. For that reason, I am a cosponsor of this amendment which would raise the price to what has been recommended by the public health community, $1.50 per pack, and to do so in 3 years. This is consistent with legislation which I have cosponsored with Senators Chafee and Harkin. 
It is not the only thing we need to do. We also need to have a comprehensive attack against teenage smoking. That comprehensive attack needs to include weapons such as restrictions on marketing and promotion--no more Marlboro Man, 
no more Joe Camel, appealing to our young people. It needs to include effective cessation efforts in the schools through public methods of communication. It needs to include look-back provisions which will surcharge the industry and individual companies if they fail to meet the nationally established goals for reduction of teenage smoking. All of those are important. 
But the reality is that the single most important part of achieving the goal of a 65-percent reduction in teenage smoking is to get the price to as high a level as reasonable as quickly as possible. The best estimates are that 85 percent of the effectiveness in terms of reducing teenage smoking will come through monetary means. The other 15 percent will be the softer, more psychological efforts at education and restraint on promotion and advertising. 
It is appropriate that we should be using the monetary means as the principal force to achieve the goal of a 65-percent reduction. Some of those who have spoken, either spoken directly or spoken through the form of very elongated questions, have inferred that there is something wrong with inserting the economic component into this debate. The fact is, there already is a substantial economic component. 
As Members know, four States, including my own, have reached very significant settlements with the tobacco industry, in which the industry essentially admitted that their costs in terms of cost to treat people with addictions related to their use of tobacco are in the billions of dollars. This is not a cost-free decision if we do nothing. If we do nothing, we accept the fact that we will continue having the American taxpayers pay these enormous annual costs to treat the illnesses of people who have been induced to smoke tobacco. 
It is also appropriate in this era of free-market economies, where we are looking to laws such as supply and demand rather than laws of regulation as a mean of affecting human behavior, that we insert as the cornerstone of this legislation a significant economic disincentive for people to utilize tobacco products, a disincentive which we know will have its primary effect on younger smokers, smokers to whom discretionary income is more limited, smokers who are less physically addicted to the use of tobacco. 
Mr. President, for those who will oppose this amendment, I issue this challenge. If you are not prepared to accept the goal of a 65-percent reduction in teenage smoking, then what is your goal and why are you prepared to support a lessened goal, recognizing that every percentage point below 65 percent means that you are consigning thousands of American young people each year to the scourge, the cost, the social issues related to the use of tobacco, and one-third of those who start the process will end up dying prematurely because of a tobacco-related affliction? 
If you are not prepared to accept the 65-percent goal, defend an alternative. If you accept the 65-percent goal but are unwilling to accept those things which are necessary to achieve it, then what is your alternative? What will be the additional items that you will substitute for what the best experts in the public health community say is required to achieve that 65-percent goal? 
We know that some of those noneconomic factors are already under assault, such as the promotion in advertising. So it becomes even more important that we adopt the amendment, as offered by Senator Kennedy and others, which will raise the price to the $1.50 level.

 Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today with a heavy heart and bearing the sorrow that Floridians and Americans everywhere feel at the death of a national treasure--Marjory Stoneman Douglas. 
Marjory Stoneman Douglas is and will always be the `Mother of the Everglades.' That title was made official in 1993, when President Clinton presented here with the Presidential Medal of Freedom--our nation's most prestigious civilian honor. 
Over 130 years ago, upon meeting Harriet Beecher Stowe for the first time, President Abraham Lincoln greeted the author of Uncle Tom's Cabin with this salutation: `So this is the little woman who started the great war.' 
Marjory Stoneman Douglas was equally influential in her own time. She was the feisty woman who started the great effort to save the Everglades from mankind's abuse and neglect. 
She was born on April 7, 1880 in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Perhaps it was this connection to `The Land of Ten Thousand Lakes' that was responsible for her intense passion for environmental preservation. She graduated from Wellesley College just over two decades later with the prophetic title of `Class Orator.' 
These two characteristics--a love of nature and a powerful determination to make her voice heard--would soon come together to the benefit of the Florida Everglades. In 1915, Marjory arrived in Miami and joined the staff of the Miami Herald. With the exception of a brief stint as a Red Cross worker during World War I, she spent the next eighty-three years working to save the Everglades from destruction. 
When Marjory Stoneman Douglas arrived in South Florida, many people thought of the Everglades as nothing more than another Florida swamp. Indeed, Governor Napoleon Bonaparte Broward, who served from 1905 to 1909, had proposed draining the Everglades to reclaim the land there. 
Marjory did not brook ignorance about the Everglades. Instead, she poured time, energy, blood, sweat, and tears into re-educating the people of Florida about the crowning jewel in Florida's collection of environmental treasures. Long before scientists became alarmed about the effects on the natural ecosystems of south Florida, she was taking public officials to task for destroying wetlands, eliminating the sheet flow of water across the Everglades, and upsetting the natural cycles upon which the entire South Florida ecosystem depends. 
Marjory's oratory and hustle produced tangible accomplishments. Her crusade to win federal protection for the wetlands scored a major victory when President Harry Truman dedicated Everglades National Park in 1947. 
That same year, she published the work that would jump-start the modern era of Everglades restoration: The Everglades: River of Grass. To this day, that tome stands as the definitive descriptive of the national treasure she fought so hard to protect. 
Visitors travel thousands of miles to see the Everglades. Scientists and naturalists spend entire lifetimes studying the Everglades' diverse habitats and unique collection of plants and animal life. Today, public officials from every ideological persuasion and geographic location line up to support efforts to protect the Everglades. None of this would have been possible without Marjory Stoneman Douglas' Herculean efforts. 
She supplemented her hard work and determination with a disarming candor. Some people will remember that Marjory co-authored a 1920's anti-gangster play entitled Storm Warnings. That title was well-suited to the personality of its author. She would frequently blow in like a Florida summer thunderstorm and give you her thoughts in no uncertain terms, leaving you dazed and drained but unmistakably sure of her intentions. 
When I was a state legislator in the late 1960's, Marjory came to Tallahassee to speak to the Dade County delegation. She conveyed one simple, blunt message: we would safeguard the health of the Everglades and if we didn't, we would all spend an uncomfortable afterlife in hell. 
I took those words to heart. When I was Governor from 1979 to 1987, Marjory and I teamed up to launch a campaign to safeguard the Florida Everglades. It is an effort that has attracted broad, bipartisan support over the years--a testament to Marjory's persuasive powers. 
In 1997, I joined Senator Connie Mack and U.S. Representative Peter Deutsch in introducing legislation to name over 1.3 million acres of the Everglades after its modern saviour. President Clinton signed that legislation in mid-November, and I helped to dedicate the `Marjory Stoneman Douglas Wilderness' on December 4, 1997--Everglades National Park's 50th Birthday. Marjory's ashes will be scattered over that wilderness area. 
Marjory Stoneman Douglas was a friend and mentor to me for many years. I will miss her greatly. I want to conclude today by reading from John Rothchild's introduction to her autobiography. Recalling her appearance at a 1973 public meeting in Everglades City, Mr. Rothchild offered this apt description:  
Mrs. Douglas was half the size of her fellow speakers and she wore huge dark glasses, which along with the huge floppy hat made her look like Scarlet O'Hara as played by Igor Stravinsky. When she spoke, everybody stopped slapping [mosquitoes] and more or less came to order. She reminded us all of our responsibility to nature. Her voice had the sobering effect of a one-room schoolmarm's. The tone itself seemed to tame the rowdiest of the local stone crabbers, developers, and the lawyers on both sides. I wonder if it didn't also intimidate the mosquitoes. 
Marjory Stoneman Douglas always got your attention--she was the most eloquent spokesperson that the Everglades will ever have. The embattled wetland lost is `Mother' last week, but we must keep her memory and legacy alive by continuing our efforts to preserve the Everglades for future generations of Floridians and Americans.

Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I am proud to join Senators Helms, Lott, Mack, and nearly twenty other Senators in introducing the Cuban Solidarity Act. This bill will capitalize on the historic opportunity provided by Pope John Paul II's visit to Cuba this past January. It provides for $100 million in humanitarian assistance directly to the Cuban people over four years, and does so in a way that will strengthen the Catholic Church and other independent organizations in Cuba. We must seize this opportunity to help our Cuban brothers and sisters who have suffered under Castro's brutal rule for far too long. 
Communism has collapsed around the world, and the only countries that maintain this economic sytsem--Cuba and North Korea--are crumbling under their own weight. This failed system has created shortages of food and medicine, and Castro has denied the basic freedoms that we take for granted to millions of ordinary Cubans. 
In addition to providing humanitarian assistance to Cuba, this bill also directs the administration to expedite the licensing of sales of medicine and medical supplies to Cuba. Since 1992, the embargo has been lifted on the sale of medicines, medical equipment, and medical supplies to Cuba. While Castro continues to claim that the United States is responsible for Cubans' lack of access to much needed medicines, the truth is that we are doing everything we can to ensure that the Cuban people can get the medical supplies denied them by the Castro government. 
Pope John Paul II called the world's attention to the suffering of the Cuban people during his visit to Cuba in January. I feel the time is right to make assistance to oppressed Cubans more easily available through organizations such as the Catholic Church and other independent groups. Targeting additional aid in this matter will have three important effects. First, it will provide humanitarian assistance directly to the Cuban people who have suffered under communism. Second, it will strengthen the position of the Catholic Church as a more independent, viable institution in Cuba. Finally, it will help to undermine Castro's policy of denying food and medicine as a means of political control. 
Pope John Paul II asked the world to open up to Cuba, and asked Cuba to open itself to the world. This bill will begin that process by providing humanitarian assistance to the Cuban people. We hope that Castro will respond by opening Cuba to the world. 
Just yesterday, Cuban Cardinal Ortega expressed concern that the Castro regime was not making an effort to open Cuba to the world--specifically regarding the political prisoners that continue to fill Cuban jails. Four of these political prisoners are in particularly desperate condition--Marta Beatriz Roque, Vladimiro Roca, Felix Bonne, and Rene Gomez Manzano--and Castro has refused appeals by the Pope and Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien to release them on humanitarian grounds. In fact, Marta Beatriz Roque is very ill with breast cancer and is being denied medical attention in jail. I hope that these political prisoners, as well as thousands of others, live to see a time when expressing one's political ideas does not mean a death sentence. 
This legislation will provide an upwelling of support for the advocates of freedom and human rights in Cuba. A number of periodic reports on exploitative labor conditions and the plight of political prisoners in Cuba will help bring the world's attention to the reality of Castro's oppression. Democracy efforts in Cuba will be bolstered through pro-active U.S. support for the Cuban opposition. Direct mail delivery from the U.S. to Cuba and additional Radio and TV Marti broadcasts will allow the Cuban people to receive uncensored news from the outside world, breaking Catro's monopoly on the dissemination of information. 
Let us not forget that U.S. support for the democracy movements of Eastern Europe helped millions of people there win the freedom to express their ideas, live without fear, and create better lives for their children. We should not turn our backs on the Cuban people now, when they need our help more than ever. The Castro government does not need food and medicine: the Cuban people do. We must ensure that our aid does not go to those who torture and kill. The Cuban Solidarity Act works to give food and medicine to those who are forgotten by Castro's regime--the poor mothers who need prenatal care, the children who need bread and milk, the elderly who die of easily curable diseases. 
Mr. President, the 11 million Cubans imprisoned by Castro's reign of terror are counting on us to enact this vital and historic piece of legislation. I hope that all of my colleagues will join Senators Helms, Lott, Mack, myself, and nearly twenty others in supporting this effort to provide a lifeline to the Cuban people.

Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I am very pleased to join my colleague Senator Boxer in introducing the `Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act.' It is a key step forward in Florida's long battle to preserve our beautiful coastal and marine ecosystems. 
Floridians oppose offshore oil drilling because it poses a tremendous threat to one of our state's greatest natural and economic resources--our coastal environment. Florida's beaches, fisheries, and wildlife draw millions of tourists each year from around the globe. Tourism directly or indirectly supports millions of jobs all across Florida, and the travel industry generates billions of dollars in economic activity every year. 
The Florida coastline boasts some of the richest estuarine areas in the world. These brackish waters, with their mangrove forests and seagrass beds, are an irreplaceable link in the life cycle of many species, both marine and terrestrial. Florida's commercial fishing industry relies on these estuaries because they support the nurseries for the most commercially harvested fish. Perhaps the most environmentally delicate regions in the Gulf, estuaries could be damaged beyond repair by even a relatively small oil spill. 
Over the years, we have met with some success in our effort to protect Florida's OCS. In 1995, the lawsuit surrounding the cancellation of the leases around the Florida Keys was settled, removing the immediate threat of oil and gas drilling from what is an extremely sensitive area. 
In June of 1997, Senator Mack and I introduced the Florida Coast Protection Act to cancel six leases in an area 17 miles off the coast of Pensacola. This bill would have provided leaseholders with the absolute right to just compensation from the federal government in order to recover their investment in these leases, while simultaneously protecting the Florida coastline that is so critical to our economy. 
Luckily, it was never necessary. Less than a week after we introduced our legislation, Mobil Oil announced that it was ending its drilling operation off the Northwest Florida coast and cancelling its exploratory leases. While Mobil's action did not completely eliminate the threats posed by oil and gas drilling, it did mean that the residents of Florida's Gulf Coast faced one fewer environmental catastrophe-in-the-making. 
The Florida delegation has also been successful in blocking other attempts to search for energy resources off our state's precious coastline. We've worked--and will continue to work--in a united, bipartisan fashion to maintain the federal moratorium on drilling in sensitive coastal areas. 
Mr. President, the bill that Senator Boxer has introduced today will provide further protection to all coastal states that have taken action to prevent offshore oil drilling by issuing a state moratorium on oil, gas, or mineral exploration, development, or production within state waters. Florida will benefit greatly from this bill, and I urge its speedy passage.

 Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I am delighted to recognize and congratulate a group of exemplary citizens upon their induction into the 1998 Dr. Nan S. Hutchinson Senior Hall of Fame. These men and women have each given a great gift to their communities--they have given of themselves. 
Arnold Abbott, 73, works everyday to fulfill his self-appointed mission to feed and help the homeless on the streets of Broward County. He also organized a small, dedicated core of volunteers to assist him in finding clothes, counseling and living arrangements, and to reunite the homeless with their family members. 
Ruth Forbes, 76, began her work of community service in 1993 with the Area Agency on Aging's Advisory Council. In her time there, she has held the positions of Legislative Chair, Vice Chair, and Chairperson. In addition to improving the lives of those in her own age group, she also aids disadvantaged children. 
Arnold & Joann Lanner, 76 and 79, respectively, work with the `I Am Somebody' program at elementary schools. This program is aimed at increasing students' self esteem. In addition, they have raised over $120,000 for the Hepburn Center, an intergenerational, community-based organization that provides after-school care and organizes activities for the elderly. 
Evelyn Jones Lewis, 70, began her volunteer work when she was appointed to serve on the Florida Advisory Council on Aging. Since then, she has been active in urging Congress to pass legislation that would improve the ever-changing nutritional and transportation needs of the elderly. 
Claire F. Mitchel, 76, is truly an asset to the elderly community because she promotes acceptance and celebration of the aging process. She promotes these values in work with organizations like the Rape Crisis Center, Women in Distress and the Older Women's League. 
Estella Mae Moriarty, 62, exemplifies the true meaning of altruism by embracing foster-care children of all ages who have been abandoned, abused or neglected. Realizing that children need a permanent home in the developing stages of their lives, she co-founded the SOS Children's Village, which provides care and comfort for children in distress. 
Lily Ann Olfern, 68, is involved with a telephone service bank to build a public safety building. Thanks to her many hours on the phone, the new facility will be opening in Davie next year. She also bags toys for children on Christmas, feeds the homeless on Thanksgiving, and teaches senior citizens how to avoid various scam operations. 
Reuben Sperber, 90, came to Florida to retire. However, he has worked just as hard during his twenty years in this community as while he was in the workforce. Over the years, Reuben has served in his temple, given of his time at the Margate General Hospital, and become one of the most respected members of the Alzheimer's Family Center's Board of Directors. 
Jacob Statemann, 76, has dedicated his time to the Southeast Focal Point Senior Center in Hollywood for over 10 years. At the Center he has taught classes ranging from current events to foreign language, and he has never hesitated to organize holiday events or assist other classes that need help. He also leads a senior choral group at HUD housing. 
Ira Subin, 83, spends much of his time and efforts helping the Area Agency on Aging's Advisory Council plan social events and fundraisers. His advocacy for the Seniors for Seniors Dollar Drive, along with matching funds that the program has received from the state, has substantially increased the quality of services that the Area Agency on Aging can provide. 
Mr. President, all of these outstanding seniors have diligently and selflessly given of their time and energy to make Broward County a better place for all its residents. Florida is very fortunate to have these inspiring senior citizens who give so much to our communities. I congratulate them today and wish for them many more productive and healthy years.

Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, approximately ten days ago, the Senate voted to ratify the accession of Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic into the North Atlantic Treaty Alliance. 
I joined 79 of my colleagues in supporting this historic measure. 
This vote occurred at the end of a week of debate in the Senate on this matter. But it signaled the beginning of an equally important process--that of redoubling or diplomatic efforts to build greater trust and cooperation with Russia. 
Many who argued against expanding the alliance did so on the assumption that such expansion would sour our relations with Russia and reduce the chances for progress in arms control. I believe that the consequences of expanding NATO are still undetermined, and that those consequences will depend largely on how we conduct our relations with Russia in the coming years. 
Russia currently has 6,680 strategic nuclear warheads, thousands of tactical warheads, and hundreds of tons of fissile material that could be used to produce additional nuclear warheads. 
Ensuring that these weapons are properly controlled and further reductions in strategic warheads are made is one of the principal national security interests of the United States. 
This is why it is critical that we take greater steps to reach out to Russia and demonstrate our desire to work with them in a cooperative fashion. 
Mr. President, in 1996, I was a member of the Commission on America's National Interests. This commission, which included my colleagues Senator McCain, Roberts, and former Senator Nunn, as well as other foreign policy experts, was charged with identifying American national interests in the Post-cold-war era. 
The Commission specifically addressed the question of expanding NATO, saying, `NATO enlargement is in the U.S. interest, but it will be essential to manage the process in ways that take account of Russian concerns.' 
We have already taken several important steps, including the U.S.-Russian Founding Act, the Nunn-Lugar programs, and the Partnership for Peace. Indeed, U.S. and Russian forces have served side by side in Bosnia. But there is much more to be done. 
We must seek new ways to cooperate and build trust between our two great nations. What is needed is a sustained creative program of outreach to demonstrate that NATO expansion was not a hostile act designed to build a new Iron Curtain closer to Russia's borders. 
Nor was it a signal that we have lost interest in helping Russia work through one of the most significant societal transformations in history. 
One suggestion for creative outreach involves the Year 2000 Problem, which is sometimes referred to as Y2K. 
We have undertaken a massive effort to deal with this issue of the reliability of our information systems after the year 2000. The Defense Department has alone identified 2800 critical systems that must be `cured' before Y2K. 
The Russians have not yet determined if they have a similar problem, not to mention they have not commenced the process of attempting to fix it. 
It is in our interests to work with Russia to help them identify the scope of their Y2K problem and to remedy it. 
It would be detrimental in the extreme to our interests if the Russians awoke on the morning of January 1, 2000, with blank screens on their early warning radars and command and control systems. What could be even worse is if their critical systems continue to operate with false and corrupted information. It is in both U.S. and Russian interests for us to have the highest level of confidence in our command and control systems and to build confidence through transparency and other cooperative measures. 
Another area that presents opportunity for sustained outreach to Russia is interparliamentary cooperation. Each member of Congress, regardless of their feelings on NATO enlargement, should make an effort to reach out to our counterparts in Russia to foster greater trust and cooperation. 
During the Cold War, intermittent attention was paid to interparliamentary relations. Unfortunately, since 1989, Russians believe that U.S. interest in such contacts has dwindled. 
Some efforts at interparliamentary cooperation are underway. I will mention two of them. The Aspen Institute has held yearly meetings since 1994 that bring together U.S. and Russian parliamentarians. Speaker Gingrich has established an initiative, under the direction of Congressman Curt Weldon, to reach out to the Russian Duma. But more should be done. Because of its responsibility to provide advice and consent on treaties, the Senate has a special responsibility to play a role in this effort. 
We can be instrumental in creating an environment in which the Russian Duma will seek to cooperate with the United States. In fact, the commission on America's National Interests spoke of `direct contact--engaging Russia in ways that demonstrate the benefits on nonaggressive behavior,' as one of the principal ways that we can promote a benign Russian foreign policy. These types of contacts will also serve to strengthen Russian democracy. All of these are very much in the United States national interest. 
While I supported NATO expansion, I was concerned that the Senate entered into the debate after the United States had already committed to expanding the alliance. 
The vote for NATO expansion in the Senate was bipartisan, but in my judgment that support was not very deep. Many senators, including myself, felt we were too deeply committed to reject expansion, calculating that the cost of non-action at this point would be greater than the risk of action. 
Preventing a repetition of this if and when there is to be additional expansion of the alliance is critical. A serious dialogue must involve Congress, the White House, and the American people, and must take place before commitments are made. 
An example of this was the structured consultations that took place between a Congress which was shifting in terms of its partisan leadership and a Democratic President immediately following the end of the Second World War. 
In fact, Senator Tom Connelly and Arthur Vandenburg, the Chairman and Ranking Member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, were personally involved in negotiating many of the post-war treaties, spending much of 1946, 
for instance, not in the Senate Chambers but overseas involved in the detailed negotiations of what was to become the framework of our cold war strategy. 
President Truman used these close consultations to build a bipartisan consensus that led, among other things, to the establishment of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization in 1949, and the strong vote of support which that treaty received from the U.S. Senate. 
Divided government raises the level of partisanship on domestic issues. As a nation, we cannot accept similar destabilization of our international values, goals, and responsibilities. 
It will be on our ability to meet those challenges that the ultimate test of the wisdom of our vote to expand the North Atlantic Treaty Organization will be predicated. 
Thank you, Mr. President.

Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, along with Senators Chafee, Johnson, Grassley, and Harkin, I will be introducing today the Nursing Home Patient Protection Act. This is legislation to protect our Nation's seniors from indiscriminate patient dumping from nursing homes. 
Approximately one month ago, it looked like 93-year-old Adela Mongiovi might have to spend her 61st Mother's Day away from the assisted living facility that she had called home for the last four years. 
At least that's what her son Nelson and daughter-in-law Gina feared when officials at the Rehabilitation and Health Care Center of Tampa told them that their Alzheimer's disease-afflicted mother would have to be relocated so that the nursing home could complete `renovations.' 
As the Mongiovis told me when I met with them and visited their mother in Tampa last month, the real story far exceeded their worst fears. The supposedly temporary relocation was actually a permanent eviction--a permanent eviction of all 52 residents whose housing and care were paid for by the Medicaid program. 
The nursing home chain that owns the Tampa facility, and several others across the United States, wanted to purge its nursing homes of Medicaid residents, ostensibly to take more private insurance payers and Medicare beneficiaries, which pay more per resident. 
While this may have been a good financial decision in the short run, its effects on our Nation's senior citizens, if practiced on a widespread basis, would be nothing short of disastrous. 
In an April 7, 1998, Wall Street Journal article, several nursing home executives argued that State governments and Congress are to blame for these evictions because they have set Medicaid reimbursement rates too low. 
While Medicaid reimbursements to nursing homes may need to be revisited, playing Russian roulette with elderly patients' lives is hardly the way to send that message to Congress or to state legislatures. While I am willing to engage in a discussion as to the equity of nursing home reimbursement rates, I and my colleagues are not willing to allow nursing homes to dump patients indiscriminately. 
The fact that some nursing home companies are willing to sacrifice elderly Americans for the sake of their own economic bottom line is bad enough. What is even worse is their attempt to evade blame for Medicaid evictions. 
The starkest evidence of this shirking of responsibility is found in the shell game many companies play to justify evictions. Current law allows nursing homes to discharge patients for--among other reasons--inability to pay. 
If a facility decreases its number of Medicaid beds, the State and Federal governments are no longer authorized to pay the affected residents' nursing home bills. The nursing home can then conveniently, and unceremoniously, dump its former Medicaid patients for--you guessed it--their inability to pay. 
Evictions of nursing home residents have a devastating effect on the health and well-being of some of society's most vulnerable members. 
A recent University of Southern California study indicated that those who are uprooted from their homes undergo a phenomenon known as `transfer trauma.' For these seniors, the consequences of transfer trauma are stark. The death rate among seniors is 2 to 3 times higher than for individuals who receive continuous care. 
Those of us who believe that our mothers, fathers, and grandparents are safe because Medicaid affects only low-income Americans, we need to think again. 
A three-year stay in a nursing home can cost upwards of $125,000. As a result of this extreme cost, nearly half of all nursing home residents who enter as private-paying patients exhaust their personal savings, lose their health insurance coverage during their stay, and become Medicaid beneficiaries. Medicaid is, for most retirees, the last refuge of financial support. 
On April 10, the Florida Medicaid Bureau responded to evidence of Medicaid dumping in Tampa by levying a steep $260,000 fine against the Tampa nursing home. That was strong and appropriate action, but it was only a partial solution. Medicaid funding is a shared responsibility--shared between the States and the Federal Government. 
While the most egregious incident occurred in Florida, Medicaid dumping is not the problem of a single State. While nursing homes were once locally run and family-owned, they are increasingly administered by multi-State, multi-facility corporations that have the power to affect seniors across the United States. 
Mr. President, let me also point out that the large majority of nursing homes in America treat their residents well, and they are responsible community citizens. Our bill is designed solely to prevent potential future abuses by the bad actors. 
This bill is simple and fair. It would prohibit current Medicaid beneficiaries, or those who `spend down' to Medicaid from being evicted from their homes. That is a crucial point, Mr. President. 
Adela Mongiovi is not just a `beneficiary'; she is a mother and she is a grandmother. And to Adela Mongiovi, the Rehabilitation and Health Care Center of Tampa is not an `assisted living facility.' To Adela Mongiovi, it is home. 
This is the place where she wants, and deserves--like all seniors--to live the rest of her life with the security of knowing that she will not be evicted. Through the passage of this bill, we can provide that security to Adela Mongiovi and to all of our Nation's seniors.

Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, the amendment that I am offering, joined by our colleagues, Senator D'Amato and Senator Feinstein, makes two modifications to the innocent spouse provision which is in this legislation. 
Background: Under the current tax law, if a husband and wife jointly sign a return, they are jointly responsible for any deficiency that might subsequently be found to have been the result of that filing. 
A typical case is that after a husband and wife have had marital discord and are divorced, the husband may have left town and is difficult to find, the IRS locates the custodial parent, typically the wife, who is more easily accessible, and then she becomes responsible for 100 percent of the tax deficiency that was the result of a filing while the marriage was in place. 
Under the current law, there is a provision called `innocent spouse' in which a spouse can theoretically avoid that responsibility. I emphasize the word `theoretically,' because the testimony we heard before the Finance Committee was that it is virtually impossible for the standards of that innocent spouse provision to be met and that, in fact, there are some 50,000 women, generally ex-spouses, who are caught up in this 100-percent responsibility for a tax return. 
In the Finance Committee hearings, we were impressed with a recommendation made by the American Bar Association as to a different approach to this issue. That approach was essentially an accounting approach which said that instead of using joint and several responsibility, it would be an individual responsibility. 
If, for instance, the husband was responsible for 60 percent of the income, which went into the tax return, and the wife, 40 percent, then those percentages would define responsibility in a subsequent deficiency. 
That basic approach was adopted by the Finance Committee, but there were some exceptions to that filing for proportional responsibility. The primary exception was that if the Secretary of the Treasury could demonstrate--and the burden is on the Secretary of the Treasury to demonstrate--that an individual making this election to be taxed only for their proportional share of the deficiency of the return, that if they had actual knowledge of the conditions within that return which led to this deficiency, then they would be 100 percent responsible. So actual knowledge would override the ability to elect only partial responsibility. 
This amendment makes two modifications to that provision. The first is the question of when is that knowledge relevant. The language that we are inserting into the legislation which is currently before the Senate is that the actual knowledge has to be `at the time such individual'--that is, the individual who is seeking to pay only a proportionate share of a deficiency-- `signed the return.' So the key question is what did you know at the time you signed the return. 
The second issue is an unfortunate reality where we had testimony that some spouses signed the joint return, and may even have had actual knowledge of its contents, but did so under duress, including under physical duress. So we have provided a second provision which says that even if you had actual knowledge at the time you signed the return, that you would not be denied the right to apply for this proportioning of responsibility if you, the individual, can establish that the return was signed under duress. 
The burden of proof is on the taxpayer to establish that even though they had actual knowledge of the circumstances in the return that led to the deficiency, but still want to secure the benefits of less than joint and several responsibility, because they were under duress, coerced into signing, it is their responsibility to carry the burden of proof that, in fact, those circumstances existed. 
Mr. President, I apologize for having taken the time of the Senate, but I thought it was important since this is a very significant part of the provision of taxpayer relief which is in this legislation. And it is a fairly expensive provision in terms of the potential for lost revenue. But that expense is one that we believe is a just expense because it will lift from the responsibility of taxpayers who were ignorant of circumstances but were entrapped by conditions that were often beyond their control and certainly beyond their knowledge and in some cases the result of actual duress and coercion, that we should recognize that and not require them to be responsible for more than their proportional share of the deficiency. 
So, Mr. President, I appreciate the joinder in this amendment by Senator D'Amato and Senator Feinstein and ask for the amendment's immediate consideration.

Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise for the purpose of offering an amendment on behalf of myself and Senator Bond. 
Yesterday, I spoke at some length about the issue of small business and the Internal Revenue Service. In that statement I pointed out that small business is a peculiarly affected part of the American economy as it relates to the Internal Revenue Service. 
Small business, as we know, is the fastest growing sector of our economy. Typically, management has multiple responsibilities and does not have the kind of access to a panoply of expertise in accounting and law as a larger business would have. Oftentimes the small businessperson and those associated with the small business are in their own learning curve as to what requirements of compliance might be. 
Therefore, it is my feeling as we look at this reform of the IRS that we should pay some special attention to how this will evolve in terms of its application to small businesses. As we know, one of the principal elements of this reform is the establishment of an IRS Oversight Board. This oversight board has the responsibility of being both the window of the Government onto the taxpayer, and the taxpayer back to the Government. So it serves an especially important role of understanding and communication. 
The legislation is written so that three of the members of the nine-member oversight board are ex officio--the Secretary of the Treasury, the IRS Commissioner, and a representative of IRS employees. The other six appointees are Presidential appointments, and according to the current draft of the legislation these six appointees must possess expertise in the following areas: management of large service organizations, customer service, Federal tax laws, information technology, organization development, and needs and concerns of taxpayers. 
The amendment that I am offering will add an additional category of expertise to be represented among the six Presidential appointees and that is the needs and concerns of small business. It is the expectation that the President would appoint six individuals, and his responsibility would be to assure that those six had a sufficient range of backgrounds that they would be able to cover the six and, if this amendment is added, the seventh requirement. 
I think it is extremely important that among the six people who are appointed as Presidential appointees to the oversight board for the Internal Revenue Service there be represented in that six one or more individuals who understand the needs and concerns of small businesses of America and can assure that those concerns are effectively communicated to the management and administration of the Internal Revenue Service and, if necessary, the Congress, for appropriate changes in law. 
The distinguished chairman of the Small Business Committee, Senator Bond, joins me in this effort. I want to commend him for his thorough analysis of the IRS bill as it affects small business and for including this provision in his legislation. 
So, Mr. President, I send to the desk an amendment which would add to the requirements for those persons who are serving on the IRS Oversight Board that there be included expertise in the needs and concerns of small business.

Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I appreciate the fact that the leader is bringing to the floor this week the Internal Revenue Service reform bill and giving the Senate the opportunity to act expeditiously on this matter. It is my hope that as soon as we act, there will be a prompt conference committee with the House, which has already passed analogous although not as comprehensive legislation, so that soon the American people will have the benefit of the reforms that are contained in this legislation. 
We did not get to this point easily. I compliment particularly Senators Bob Kerrey and Charles Grassley, who served on the commission that reviewed the IRS from which many of the ideas contained in this legislation have emanated. I congratulate Senators Roth and Moynihan of the Finance Committee for having led us to this point. And I congratulate new Commissioner Rossotti of the IRS, who has brought a fire, an energy, to reform the agency from the inside that has facilitated the consideration of these structural changes that will be contained in this legislation.

Mr. GRAHAM. Thank you, Mr. President. 
Mr. President, first, I will comment on some provisions which will be in the Senate bill that I have had a particular interest in and then to alert the Senate to an amendment I will be offering, possibly with others, when we reach the consideration of this bill. 
This bill follows many months of investigations and hearings by the Finance Committee, both in Washington and throughout the Nation. It follows a process in which the committee has first tried to do a careful diagnosis of what was the problem and then consider the options, the prescriptions that might deal with that problem, and then incorporate into this legislation that prescription which was considered to be the most appropriate. 
I compliment the people who have participated in this process. Specifically, I held a hearing in January in Orlando, FL, where a number of Floridians had the opportunity to participate in this thoughtful process of diagnosis and prescription. I know that Senator Nickles held a similar hearing in Oklahoma. Other Senators communicated with their constituents through various forums. So this is, in a real sense, a product of the people of America. 
Let me review some of the diagnoses and the pathologies in the IRS that surfaced. One of those was the need to help taxpayers resolve their debts. What was discovered was that many taxpayers want to resolve their IRS debts but the Code imposes so many penalties that once a liability is established, it is very difficult to satisfy that debt. 
As an example, a Floridian, Carl Junstrom of Tampa, over 10 years ago, because of misinterpreted advice of an IRS agent, ended up being responsible for $25,000 in taxes. He entered into an agreement with the IRS under which he paid $181 a month towards that debt owed. After having faithfully met that monthly obligation for almost a decade, and having paid $28,000 towards an original $25,000 indebtedness, Mr. Junstrom was informed that he still owed $26,000. 
How is that possible? The answer is, because the penalty clock kept running during the pendency of this agreement and, therefore, although he thought he was paying off his indebtedness and, in fact, paid $3,000 more than he originally owed, because of accumulated penalties during that same 10-year period, he ended up owing more than he had at the beginning of the process. 
What is the remedy? This bill includes a provision that encourages the IRS and the taxpayers to engage in installment agreements by, one, assuring the availability of payment plans for taxpayers with liabilities of $10,000 or less and, two, eliminating the failure-to-pay penalty for periods where the taxpayer is making payments pursuant to an installment agreement. 
In the case of Mr. Junstrom, the penalty clock would have stopped as long as he was making his $181-a-month payments. 
Another remedy is to adopt proposals to eliminate the differential between the interest rate the IRS charges individuals and the rate that the IRS pays taxpayers. Previously, there had been a higher interest charged to the taxpayers on a deficit than the interest which the taxpayer would receive if it was found that they were owed a refund. That differential is eliminated in this legislation. 
A second problem identified was protecting the innocent taxpayer. What is the problem? One example of the problem is that many individuals filing joint returns find out subsequent to filing those joint returns that their spouse has understated income or overstated deductions. Although the individual may have had little or no income and little or no knowledge of this, the IRS holds that person responsible for 100 percent of the taxes attributable to the individual spouse's action. This typically surfaces after there has been a divorce and one spouse, often the husband, has left town. The wife, who usually has custodial responsibility for the children, is still there and is accessible, so she becomes the target for the IRS collection activity. About 50,000 women a year are in that category which is generically referred to as the `innocent spouse.' An example is Karen Andreasen, a Floridian. Her signature was forged on a joint return, but she ended up being held liable for her ex-husband's debts. 
The remedy? The remedy incorporates legislation which Senator D'Amato and others, including myself, have introduced as discrete legislation. This generally would adopt an approach recommended by the American Bar Association which essentially says that each spouse is to pay his or her share of the tax liability in proportion to what he or she contributed to the original tax return. If, for example, the return represented income that was 80 percent the husband's earning and 20 percent wife's earning, in a subsequent dispute the wife would be limited to a responsibility of 20 percent of any deficiency. That is a very important provision in this legislation, which will have an immediate benefit, because this legislation applies this new standard retroactively to existing open cases for many tens of thousands of spouses caught in this vice. 
Another issue that surfaced was assisting taxpayers in their negotiations with the IRS. What is the problem? The problem is that many taxpayers, especially small businesses and moderate-income families, find themselves unable to negotiate with an agency which has the power to seize, levy and garnish wages. An example, Betty Bryant of Miami, Florida started a small business to supplement her income as a State employee. She actually overpaid her taxes but filled out the form incorrectly and ended up with wages being garnished while this matter was in controversy. Another example, Thomas Jones, submitted an offer-in-compromise to the IRS. The offer was rejected even though the IRS admitted they couldn't find his file. They rejected his offer even though they didn't have the information upon which to make an intelligent judgment as to whether the offer was appropriate or not. He also was not apprised of his right to appeal the rejection of his offer. 
What is the remedy? The Finance Committee includes proposals to require a review of any IRS decision to reject an offer-in-compromise by collection. This will assure that there will be some independent party reviewing the offer in compromise. Moreover, the bill requires that the taxpayer be notified of this right. 
In addition, the bill requires the IRS to suspend collection efforts if the taxpayer appeals the rejection of an offer-in-compromise. 
The committee also approved proposals to expand the IRS Alternative Dispute Resolution Program. In many jurisdictions, the development of alternative dispute resolution procedures has provided a significant and frequently much more efficient alternative to traditional litigation. This proposal would build 
upon a pilot program initiated by the IRS pursuant to the Alternative Dispute Resolution Act of 1996. It would allow third-party mediation of cases of tax disputes. It would also establish a pilot program for the use of arbitration in tax disputes. 
The legislation also provides a proposal to require acceptance of an offer-in-compromise if the IRS has lost the taxpayer's file. 
Another area where Senators found deficiencies in the IRS is customer service. What is the problem? Many taxpayers feel they are treated as criminals rather than as customers. The IRS is often unreachable and difficult to pin down on advice they give to taxpayers on how to properly fill out a return. Jim Stamps of Jacksonville provided testimony that it had taken him 4 years to get a letter stating that he had paid off all the taxes that he owed. Without that letter, many opportunities that were available to him personally and in business were frustrated. 
Mr. Junstrom, who I mentioned earlier, the man who had the $25,000 bill, paid $28,000 but still owed $26,000, and had requested the IRS to sit down with him to explain what he owed. He never was afforded that opportunity and continued to receive confusing and conflicting notices. 
What is the remedy? The bill reported out of the committee includes a requirement that the IRS evaluate employees on their customer service as well as on their collection ability. The Finance Committee heard testimony indicating that in the past not only was there almost a total focus of evaluation based on how much money an agent collected, but that those standards became numeric, and if you didn't meet the standard of collections, then you received a downgrade on your evaluation. 
This legislation repeats and expands upon a directive that Senator Grassley wrote into the Taxpayer Bill of Rights that made it illegal to evaluate an IRS employee based on a numerical standard of how much was collected. But this legislation goes beyond that and says that employee evaluation will give emphasis to their customer service as well as their other responsibilities. 
The IRS reform bill will also increase accessibility by a very simple thing--pick up the telephone book today and look under U.S. Government in virtually any community in America and then look under IRS. One thing you will see is an 800 number as to where to call to get service. There are two things that you typically do not see. First, you may not find a local telephone number that you can call in the event that the 800 number is busy, which happens frequently, particularly during periods just before April the 15th. Second, what you don't see is an address so that the taxpayer who wants to go down and actually meet face to face with a human being to review their problem will know where to call and where to go. This legislation will require the IRS publish both its local telephone number and its local address. 
The legislation requires the IRS to issue annual statements to taxpayers who have entered into installment agreements, like Mr. Junstrom. The statement would include amounts paid, remaining balance, and projected pay-off time so that the taxpayer will be in regular knowledge of where he or she stands with the IRS. 
None of us purports that this legislation will solve all of the problems and all the taxpayer complaints with the IRS. And we should resist the temptation to oversell this legislation. The IRS will have to take many administrative actions to implement these laws and undertake other reforms to achieve that goal. Fortunately, I believe the IRS is moving expeditiously to become a more user-friendly agency. It is dealing with a culture which in the past has focused inside the agency, what was to the convenience of the agency, like not publishing the address so that taxpayers wouldn't come down to the IRS office and ask a lot of questions, 
to an agency that is moving to a culture of being consumer friendly and saying: Here is where we are, come down and we seriously want to render service to the taxpayer. 
Commissioner Rossotti has implemented a broad range of reforms and has undertaken investigations to get to the bottom of other allegations that have been made about the agency's activities. The IRS has extended its hours, implemented problem resolution days, and has stopped evaluating collection agents based on the numerical amount of taxes they collect. This legislation will continue that effort. Mr. President, all of what I have just said is in the bill that we will soon be considering, and I recommend that bill and these provisions to my colleagues. 
Let me now turn to a provision that is not currently in the bill. It is my intention to offer an amendment to ensure that the new IRS Oversight Board will have at least one member with expertise on small business issues. 
One of the recurring themes of the hearings that we have had is the concentration of problems between taxpayers and the IRS, especially when that taxpayer was a small businessman or woman--an individual who frequently is relatively new to business, learning what the difference was between an expense deductible item and an item that had to be amortized over time, a person who frequently did not have access to or could not afford expert professional advice, but a person who was trying to comply with their legal responsibilities. 
These are not evaders of taxation, they are people who need help, and up-to-date information, in order to meet their responsibilities. 
We are creating in this legislation an oversight board. That oversight board is intended to provide a new window of enlightenment, in both directions, from the public to the IRS, and from the IRS back to the public. Under legislation crafted in the Finance Committee, the current board would be composed of 9 individuals. Those 9 individuals will include the Secretary of the Treasury, the IRS Commissioner, and a representative of the IRS employees. In addition to those 3 named individuals, there will be 6 Presidential appointees. Each of these 6 must possess expertise in at least one of the following areas: Management of large service organizations, customer service, Federal tax laws, information technology, organization development, and the needs and concerns of taxpayers. 
Missing from this list is any specific requirement for expertise in small business issues--an omission that I consider to be glaring given the fact that small businesses are the backbone of the American economy and such a large target of concern for IRS activities. 
I believe that at least one of the members of the IRS oversight board should have practical experience in small business issues. 
Let me outline the reasons why I feel so strongly about this, and why I will be introducing an amendment to make this part of the IRS reform legislation. 
Small businesses have more difficulty dealing with the complex Internal Revenue Code. Small businesses have relatively less time, money, and expertise than large corporations. They need an IRS that is sensitive to these limitations. 
Let me explain how I came to this conclusion with a specific example that relates to this bill. 
In January of this year, I hosted a Retirement Security Summit at the University of South Florida in Tampa. One session of that Retirement Security Summit specifically focused on the issue of small businesses and their pension plans. 
Delegates, small business owners and their representatives discussed their frustrations and their experiences with the IRS. They told me that many small businesses do not offer retirement plans for their employees because they fear the draconian penalties that the IRS can impose for inadvertent violations of complex pension laws. 
Mr. President, this is a very serious issue of security for tens of millions of Americans who work for small businesses, the fastest-growing sector of our economy, but whose employers do not provide pension and retirement programs. 
We identified that one of the reasons for that unwillingness to provide these programs is the concern of the consequences of subsequent IRS enforcement if the small business finds itself in some technical violation. 
Several of my Senate colleagues and I began to consider whether congressional action would help solve this problem. We drafted legislation to provide that companies that correct errors prior to audit would not be subject to sanction. But before we offered the proposal as an amendment to the IRS Reform bill, we wrote to the IRS commissioner, Mr. Rossotti, and asked him if the IRS proposed to change the imposition of penalties for inadvertent errors. 
Commissioner Rossotti responded immediately, in a matter of days, and committed to expanding existing self-correction programs and allow taxpayers to rely on those self-correction programs. We were pleased with the quick action of the commissioner in issuing Revenue Procedure 98-22, which many small businesses have characterized as a common sense, reasonable solution to their problem. 
That process made me realize how difficult it is for many small businesses to comply not only with the complexities of tax laws as they relate to pension plans, but the whole array of rules that the Internal Revenue Code has spawned. It made me further realize that the IRS needs to be sensitive to small businesses when it issues regulations and enforces the tax laws. 
Small business owners often have fewer resources, but must still comply with the same complicated Tax Code as large businesses. Small businesses cannot afford to hire full-time lawyers and accountants to monitor the Tax Code for changes that may apply to them. And small businesses should not have to wait for Congress to be able to change the law where solutions can be found by administrative action. 
The myriad of challenges that small businesses face have been reflected in the hearings the Finance Committee has held this year on IRS reform. Many of the taxpayers who have testified so persuasively about mistreatment at the hands of IRS agents have been small business owners. 
In my opinion, by adding a small business person to the IRS oversight board, we will be able to provide for a more prompt, more sensitive understanding of the needs of small businesses and the ability of IRS to respond internally. 
Even the IRS has acknowledged the unique needs of small businesses. In testimony before the Senate Finance Committee on January 28 of this year, Commissioner Rossotti proposed reorganizing the IRS into 4 units--each charged with end-to-end responsibility for serving a particular group of taxpayers. He proposed dedicating one of those four working units to small businesses. 
Mr. President, it is for those reasons that it is my intention, with other Members of the Senate, to offer an amendment to this bill, when it is before the Senate, to include a representative of small business as one of the 6 presidential appointees to the IRS oversight board. I believe this would be of substantial benefit to the enforcement of our tax laws as they relate to the special needs of small businesses. 
Mr. President, before I conclude, I want to acknowledge the efforts of Senator Kit Bond, who chairs the Small Business Committee. He has included a similar provision in legislation that he will be introducing. 
Should the requirement that the oversight board have small business expertise not be incorporated in the bill through Senator Bond's amendment, I will urge adoption of this targeted amendment that I will intend to offer. 
The amendment is simple, fair, and essential if we are to bolster our Nation's small businesses. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support legislation to include small business on the IRS oversight board. I ask the managers to let us know when it would be appropriate to introduce this amendment. 
Mr. President, I appreciate this opportunity to discuss the process by which the items in the IRS reform bill have been developed. It has been thoughtful and it has received the strong, steady support of our chairman, Senator Roth, and has led to a set of reforms that I believe the Senate will be very much carrying out the wishes of the American people in adopting. 
With respect to small business, Commissioner Rossotti stated:  
Another very important group of taxpayers are small businesses, including sole proprietors and small business corporations. There are about 25 million filers in this category. Compared to other individual taxpayers, this group has much more frequent and complex filing requirements and pays much more directly to the IRS, including tax deposits, quarterly employment returns, and many other types of income tax returns and schedules. Providing good service to this group of taxpayers is more difficult than wage and investment filers, and compliance and collection problems are also much greater. Small start-up businesses in particular need special help. By dedicating a fully responsible unit to providing all IRS services for the self-employed and small business, this unit will be able to work closely with industry associations, small business groups and preparers to solve problems for the benefit of all. 
Commissioner Rossotti is right. The IRS needs to focus resources on helping small businesses, and that focus needs to be reflected on the Oversight Board. 
The amendment that I propose to offer is also needed because small businesses play such a central role in our nation s economic strength. The numbers tell the story: 
Small Business Administration figures indicate that of the 5,369,068 employer firms in 1995, 78.8% had fewer than 10 employees, and 99.7% had fewer than 500 employees. 
Employers with fewer than 500 employees increased from 4,941,821 in 1988 to 5,261,967 in 1994, a 6.5% increase. 
The number of small business owners (as measured by business tax returns) in the United States increased by 57% since 1982. 
According to the Small Business Administration, America's small businesses created 11,827,000 jobs from 1992 to 1996. This number represents the vast majority of all new jobs created during that period. 
Small microbusinesses with 1-4 employees generated about 50% of all the net new jobs from 1992-1996, while firms with 5-19 employees created another 27% of new employment opportunities. 
The fastest growing of small-business-dominated industries during the past several years include restaurants, outpatient care facilities, offices of physicians, special trade construction contractors, computer and data processing services, and credit reporting and collection. 
Ninety-four percent of high technology firms have less than 500 employees; 73% have fewer than 20 employees. 
In my home state of Florida, the productivity of small business is astounding. 
In 1996, Florida had 348,000 businesses with employees. 99% of all businesses with employees had less than 500 workers. 
The state also had 412,000 self-employed persons in 1996, for an estimated total of 760,000 businesses. 
In Florida, small businesses created 1,081,000 or the 1,194,000 net new jobs from 1992 to 1996. Very small businesses (less than 20 employees) created 71.7% of the small business growth with 775,000 new jobs. These numbers reflect the importance of small businesses as job creators. 
Recent IRS statistics reflect the rapid growth of small businesses. They indicate that net income reported by sole proprietors has doubled in the last decade. 
It is because of these reasons and trends that I urge my colleagues to support this effort to give small businesses a voice on the IRS Oversight Board. 
Mr. President, I want to acknowledge the efforts of Senator Kit Bond, Chairman of the Small Business Committee, in this area. He included a similar provision in his IRS Reform bill. 
Should the requirement that the Oversight Board have small business expertise not be adopted via a broader amendment, I will urge the adoption of this targeted amendment. 
The amendment I propose is simple, fair, and essential if we are to bolster our nation's small businesses. I urge my colleagues to support it--and ask the managers to let us know when it is appropriate to introduce the amendment. The amendment that I propose to offer will extend its benefits in a very significant way to the most important part of the American economy, the small business community of this Nation. 
Thank you, Mr. President.

 Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise to announce my cosponsorship of Senator Bumpers' `Consumer and Main Street Protection Act of 1998.' My support for this legislation is based on four important principles: 
First, this bill promotes tax fairness. Mail order businesses unfairly benefit from their unique status. They can engage in interstate commerce--sell products to customers in any state of the nation--but are not responsible for collecting state and local sales taxes. 
This places state and local businesses, which have no choice but to collect sales tax on the merchandise they sell, at a severe competitive disadvantage. This is especially damaging to small businesses, which are the backbone of our nation's economy. Over the last five years, Florida businesses with less than 20 employees have created 71 percent of all new jobs in the state--775,000 in total. Our bill will put main street merchants on the same competitive footing as mail order businesses. 
Second, this bill protects consumers. It prevents them from experiencing an unexpected and unwelcome tax surprise. Many mail order shoppers are unaware that most states are empowered to assess a sales tax on the purchase of goods sold across state lines. They are surprised when states like Florida come around to collect sales tax due on particularly expensive goods. 
Third, this bill preserves states' rights. Mr. President, there is no state right that is more fundamental than the right to decide how to raise revenue. Because the federal government has not protected this right, Florida currently loses an estimated $168.9 million each year in potential revenues. Nationwide, states have lost more than $3.3 billion as a result of Washington's handcuffs. If we are determined to make good on our promise to return more power and responsibility to states and local communities--and I think we must be--it makes no sense to dictate how Governors and legislators raise money. That's their job, not ours. 
Mr. President, state officials from across the nation are asking for our help. But don't take my word for it. Ask the National Governors Association, which once again passed a resolution supporting this kind of federal legislation at its Winter 1997 meetings. 
Finally, this bill provides fairness to mail order firms. Most companies with nationwide sales of less than $3 million are exempt. The act gives companies the option of collecting a single blended rate for each state rather than the myriad of different state and local rates. Out of state companies only have to file tax returns once per quarter. And states participating in the Act must establish a toll-free number for out-of-state companies to obtain information and forms. 
Mr. President, it is time that the federal government remove the straitjacket from states and restore to Governors and state legislators their power to raise revenue. I commend Senator Bumpers for his efforts to preserve states' rights in these important fiscal matters.

Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today, joined by my esteemed colleague Senator Mack, to introduce legislation to rename the Gainesville, Florida Veterans Affairs Medical Center after its distinguished and long-time Director: Malcolm Randall. 
After thirty-two years as Director of the Gainesville VAMC, and a total of fifty-nine years in federal service, Mr. Randall retires today. He leaves behind a long list of accomplishments and an even longer list of admirers--myself included. 
Mr. President, allow me to take a few minutes to highlight the career of this visionary person--a man who has redefined the term `public servant' over the last half-century. 
Malcolm Randall's accomplishments are far-reaching and are a testament to the loyalty and devotion he has shown the United States throughout his lifetime. 
His extensive service to our nation began when he enlisted in the Navy in July of 1942 and was sent off to the South Pacific in the midst of World War II. While courageously fighting on PT boats and battleships in the first battle of the Phillipine Sea, Mr. Randall was injured in the line-of-duty. After four years of valiant active military service, Mr. Randall continued serving his country through his dedicated work in the Veterans' Administration. His outstanding accomplishments and achievements during his tenure at the VA have been recognized with the two highest awards that the VA offers: the Meritorious Service Award, and the Exceptional Service Award, both of which recognize his outstanding performance and exceptional contributions to the improvement of health care for veterans. 
In 1984, President Reagan paid homage to Mr. Randall with the Presidential Rank Award for his extraordinary accomplishments in the administration of VA programs in Florida, and for exemplifying the highest standards in leadership. Most flattering to Mr. Randall was that this award was recommended by dedicated public servants and local leadership from his own community. Indeed, it was this innovative and thoughtful style of leadership that allowed Mr. Randall to foresee the challenges and obstacles that the VA would face in the 21st Century. 
Mr. Randall's dogged determination to serve the veterans of Florida, coupled with his visionary leadership, led to his most significant contribution to our nation's veterans: VA restructuring. As Chairman of the Florida Network of VA Hospitals and Outpatient Clinics, Malcolm Randall realized that the VA had to undergo a major transformation to continue to serve veterans well. He understood that the VA health care system needed to modernize, become more efficient with its resources, and adapt to a new method for health care delivery. 
Mr. Randall saw the future--that the VA was moving towards a `no-new-starts' policy for major hospital construction--and he became an early advocate for a new model of VA health care: a strong network of outpatient clinics and hospitals, designed to serve veterans in remote areas more effectively. As a result, 7 new outpatient clinics were built in Florida, a development which has allowed many thousands of Florida veterans to get the health care they deserve but were previously denied. 
Throughout his long and successful tenure as Director of the Gainesville VAMA, Malcolm Randall has also been a leader in introducing new medical technology to improve the quality of care for the heroes of our country. His responsibility for VA health planning throughout the entire state enabled Mr. Randall to initiate affiliations with three major teaching hospitals--the University of South Florida, the University of Florida, and the University of Miami--and several community colleges. These partnerships have allowed veterans to receive the finest care available from institutions renowned throughout the country. 
Mr. Randall's excellence has not been limited to his professional service. His community service throughout the state of Florida, and especially in his hometown of Gainesville, has resulted in several tributes and distinctions being bestowed upon him, including being named Gainesville's Citizen of the Year in 1977. The University of Florida also recognized his lifetime devotion to public service by awarding him an honorary doctorate of Public Service. 
Mr. President, it has been one of the great treasures of my life to have shared the friendship of Malcom Randall. As governor and now as a United States Senator from Florida, Malcom has allowed me to enter his classroom on health care policy and his heart, which is full of compassion for American veterans. All he has done has emanated from his depth of concern for American veterans, firmly attached to his rigorous mind and dedicated spirit to put ideas into action. Florida and America are fortunate to have had him as a fellow citizen. 
Mr. President, I salute Malcom Randall for all that he has done on behalf of all of our veterans. It is fitting that one of the best medical centers in the country bear his name.

Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, first to my good friend from Georgia and to my good friend from North Dakota, I wish to express my commendation for the quality of debate that is taking place this evening and that has taken place throughout the period of consideration of this legislation. This is, as we will all agree, important business that we are about. I believe that we all start from a desire to see that the young people of our Nation have the best possible educational opportunities. We may differ on the details of how we think we can achieve that objective, but we should respect our individual desires to achieve that goal. 
It is ironic that we are having this debate on this week as we mourn the death of our former colleague, Senator Terry Sanford. Senator Sanford, in the earlier part of his career, was the distinguished Governor of North Carolina, from 1961 to 1965. During that period, he formed an alliance with the then-president of Harvard, who had written extensively on the needs of education in America in the postwar period. Then-Governor Sanford took the leadership in establishing an organization called the Education Commission of the States. The purpose of the Education Commission of the States was to assist in the national debate to rationalize what should be the role of the Federal Government and the individual States in meeting the educational needs of American youth. 
It was agreed by the founders of the Education Commission of the States, under the leadership of Governor Sanford, that the primary responsibility for education in America is and should be at the local and State level. But it was also recognized that there were important national goals of education which justified a Federal participation. What were some of those national roles? One, which was particularly searing at the time of Governor Sanford, was the issue of civil rights; that the National Government had a responsibility of assuring that all children had their full, legal civil and human rights protected within the education setting; that education should be an opportunity available to all American youth. The Education Commission of the States recognized that the Federal Government had a particular role in higher education, specifically in assuring access to higher education for all American children. 
We had just come through the period of the GI bill, at the end of World War II, and we were learning, as a Nation, the benefits that we had secured by the fact that millions of Americans who previously had no chance at higher education suddenly were given that opportunity and that that opportunity should not be limited to that one generation who fought and won World War II, but should be a permanent part of our national commitment to its own future. And a third important area was at-risk children, children who did not come into this world with the benefits and opportunities to be fully competitive and were going to require additional assistance because of their circumstances which were beyond their control. 
Those have traditionally been some of the priority areas that have defined what should be Federal policy for education. I believe that as they were in the early 1960s, they continue in the late 1990s as important principles to determine what should be the Federal role in education. 
For that reason, I am pleased with much of what is in this legislation, but concerned about other important provisions. I am concerned, for instance, about a theme that is running through several of the amendments that we have adopted, which essentially says that this thoughtful construction of a Federal role in education is no longer relevant, that we can treat all Federal education funds as if they are fungible, that they can serve any purpose that a State determines, that there is no longer an appropriate, focused Federal role in these areas such as access to higher education and at-risk children. 
We have adopted not just in one place but in several places amendments, language that says essentially, notwithstanding any other law or provision, that any Federal education funds can be used for the specific object that the authors of that amendment thought were appropriate. 
I do not believe that is tolerable education policy. It is not policy. It is the denial of a rational policy to direct Federal educational actions and resources. 
For that reason, I am going to vote for this bill, but I will announce at this point that if this bill should come back from the conference committee containing these what I consider to be troublesome provisions, I will have to vote against the conference report. I believe there is a sufficient amount of good in this bill that it is not appropriate at this stage to pronounce its death; that, rather, we should try, with the opportunities that will be available to us in the next few weeks and with the confidence that I have in a person such as Senator Coverdell--that we will be able to keep what is constructive and what is consistent with our tradition, keep those things that Senator Sanford would be pleased to have as part of his legacy of educational policy for America, and discard those that are not constructive and not consistent with our traditions. 
Let me focus on those areas in which I believe there is substantial good embedded for our education and consistent with our tradition. 
The fundamental thrust of this legislation is to increase the access to higher education. While much has been made of the amendment that bears the specific name of the Senator from Georgia as to its role in elementary and secondary education, if anyone looks at the actual numbers and how this will play out in the planning of the American family, the reality is that the program is going to have its principal utility in preparing a family to meet those enormous costs that are associated with higher education, and, thus, its principal contribution is going to be in making it possible for families to save and plan and prepare for the cost of college and university. And that is a good thing. We are going to spend approximately $1.7 billion to accomplish that. 
But that is not the only area in which we are going to encourage access to higher education. There is another provision in this bill which was sponsored by the senior Senator from New York, Senator Moynihan, which happens to have a cost over the same time period of approximately $2 billion, more than the cost of Senator Coverdell's provision. 
What will that provide? That will extend the current provision in the law that says an employer can provide higher education tuition to one of its employees so that that employee can increase his or her skills and wisdom and contribution both to the company and to his or her own goals, and that that employee will not have to take into the employee's income the value of that tuition provided by the employer. 
That is clearly a provision aimed at making more certain, more stable, our concept of access to higher education through cooperation between employers and employees. 
There is another provision which I have been active in advocating, and that relates to State programs through which families can purchase contracts to pay the tuition and, in the case of many States, the room and board for their child or grandchild or nephew or niece in advance of the time that that child is ready to enter college or university. 
These plans, which now are in place in 21 States and will add another 13 States before the end of 1998, vary but have some similar elements. Those elements generally include the ability to purchase at a point in time the tuition for a child prior to the time that child is ready for college and, thus, lock in the tuition at its current level. Thus, the family is able to avoid tuition inflation, which has been running substantially higher than inflation in the general economy and higher than increases in family income. 
It also provides an effective means by which families can plan and save for that large cost. It also fundamentally changes the nature of the question that a child will ask as they are growing towards college years. They no longer will have to ask the question, `Will I be able to afford to go to college?' Instead, they will ask the questions `Will I be prepared to go to college? Will I work hard enough? Will I make adequate grades? Will I be able to distinguish myself so that I will be admitted to the college for which I have already made financial preparations?' 
I think that will be a very important step toward increasing the level of motivation and quality of learning. 
There has been a cloud over these plans, the plans that Senator Landrieu sponsored when she was the Treasurer of the State of Louisiana, the plans which many Members of this Senate have been involved with in their individual States, and that cloud was that the Internal Revenue Service has said these plans are taxable and, therefore, sent a chilling signal to States considering the establishment of the plan and individual families' participation. 
In the last two years, in what I think were very wise decisions, this Congress eliminated the taxability of the plans on an annual basis. That is, as the interest accrued in the account for a particular child, that accumulation would no longer be subject to Federal income taxation. 
The provision that is in this bill, which happens to have approximately the same cost to the Federal Treasury of $1.7 billion as the underlying provision of the Senator from Georgia, will say that when the funds are transferred at the time of commencement of college education from the State higher education tuition trust fund to the individual university to which the student is now going to be enrolled, that that transaction will also be nontaxable. So the family can be assured that every dollar that it invests, every dollar that is accumulated in the fund during the period that the child is maturing to college age, will be used for that child's education. 
I believe that with the adoption of this provision, we will find many more States that will establish a State plan and many more families than the over 700,000 who are currently participating will participate in this means of preparing for their child's higher education. 
At the end of the day with this legislation, we will have Senator Coverdell's bill which will provide one means through an educational savings account to prepare for higher education, we will have Senator Moynihan's provision that will provide for the adult who is studying through the financial assistance of his or her employer, and we will have State-based plans fully tax free providing another vehicle by which Americans, youth and adult, can see that they will have the resources to meet their goal of higher education. 
That is a good thing. That is consistent with the role of the Federal Government which we have established at least since the GI bill in World War II and the definition of the Federal role in education as established by then Governor Terry Sanford. 
Another issue which is a very serious one, for which Senator Dorgan has just made an excellent plea, is the issue of school construction. This is a national crisis. The General Accounting Office completed a study a couple of years ago which indicated the cost of bringing existing schools up to appropriate educational standards was in the range of $110 billion to $120 billion. 
There is not a comparable figure as to what is the cost of building new schools to meet the demands of a growing student population and to keep class size at reasonable levels, but the best estimate is that it is at least the equal of that cost of rehabilitation. 
I believe that this is an area in which the Federal Government has a role and needs to play a more effective partnership with the States. We are already doing a significant amount to assist the States. We are providing that States have access to tax-free financing when those financings are done directly to a public agency for purposes of public education. 
In this bill we have a provision which may be arcane but which will be significant, particularly to many small and rural school districts. And that is a provision that builds upon action taken a year ago in which we allow a school district that issues no more than $10 million per year in tax-exempt bonds to keep the difference between the interest that is earned as a lender of the funds prior to paying construction vendors and the interest which it pays to the bondholders. 
As an example, a typical school district might issue a bond issue and pay 6.5 percent interest to bondholders who do not have to pay tax on this interest received. For the period of time before it actually begins to spend that money to construct a school, it may be able to loan that money for 8.5 percent. This would allow the school district to keep that 2 percent differential, which is referred to as arbitrage. 
This proposal will make this arbitrage rebate exemption available to districts issuing up to $15 million in bonds, rather than the current $10 million. This will be particularly valuable to those small school districts who only occasionally are in the business of building that elementary school that they may only construct once every 50 years in order to meet their needs. 
Another important provision which I think will be, if adopted, the beginning of a new and creative approach to public education construction assistance from the Federal level is called the private activity bonds. Private activity bonds are bonds issued by a public agency on behalf of a private concern in order to serve a public purpose. These bonds today are primarily used in areas such as airports, seaports, mass transit facilities, water and sewer facilities, solid waste disposal facilities, housing for low-income and affordable housing. Those are the kinds of areas in which this type of financing is currently available. 
By the adoption of a provision which is in this bill, we will make this available for the first time to public schools. The irony is that under provisions that are already in effect, private schools, both at the higher education level and at the primary and secondary level, are benefiting by private activity bonds. This creates parity by allowing public schools for the first time to participate directly in private activity bonds. 
Some examples of how this might work--let me give an example that is currently in a stage of finalization in Orange County, Orlando, FL, which is the home of one of the most rapidly expanding school populations in the country. 
I ask if I could have 3 more minutes to close.

Mr. GRAHAM. I thank the Senator. 
In the Orange County school district a proposal that is close to becoming a reality involves the school district working with the private developer who will build a public school which will be co-located with a YMCA facility. The school district would make payments on the building at 2 percent interest for 5 years. At the end of that 5-year period the school district will receive the building and lease out space to the YMCA, a creative example of financing co-location, being able to use the school as a means of meeting a variety of the needs of the children of that community. This use of private activity bonds will accelerate the creativity and innovation of school districts, particularly those that are facing crushing demands by escalating student population. This provision in the legislation before us has a cost of approximately $400 million. If I had a criticism, I would say both of these provisions, the one for the small and the rural schools and that for the fast-growing schools, are inadequate to the challenge. But in the one case it is building on progress that we made last year, on the other it is starting a new departure which I think will have tremendous long-term benefit. 
So it is for provisions like those that I will vote for this legislation. It is my hope, as I indicated, that with the good will and effort of people like Senator Coverdell, and Members of my side of the aisle, that in conference we can take the ideas that are consistent with our tradition of a Federal role in education, build upon them, shape them, and bring them to the point that they can serve important, constructive purposes for the youth of America; with those ideas which may have been introduced, I would say, more for theater than for serious public policy, they can be discharged and will not cause the good ideas to be placed in jeopardy. 
I want this legislation to become law. I want to see the benefits in terms of access to higher education, school construction, and the other valuable provisions which are included in this bill to be made available to the children and communities of America. Therefore, I will vote for this legislation. And I wish it well as it moves on to the next stages of its journey. 
Thank you, Mr. President.

 Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, the 1998 Defense Authorization Bill contains a provision, which I introduced as an amendment, that requires the Secretary of Defense to conduct an assessment of the Cuban threat to United States national security. The bill requires the Secretary to report to Congress on this assessment by March 31, 1998. The report has been delayed, and it now appears that the report will be released after Congress begins the Easter recess. 
While the final report has not been released and no member of Congress has yet been briefed on its content, a draft report was leaked to the press and several articles have appeared over the past few days. I am concerned that this information was leaked to the press before the report was provided to Congress. 
Members of Congress are now in the position of having to respond to these press reports without the benefit of knowing the actual contents of the report. Since Congress will not be in session for over two weeks and our ability to respond to the report will be limited, I would like to take this opportunity to provide some context for the report and for the reason that I requested it. 
Cuba, under Fidel Castro's dictatorial regime, has a well documented history of threatening the national security of the United States. From the Cuban Missile Crisis, to the Mariel Boatlift, to the Brothers to the Rescue shootdown, the pattern of provocation and threat to the well being of Americans is clear. Unfortunately what is also clear is a pattern of unpreparedness on the part of the United States to respond to Cuban provocations. In fact, NBC News reported that President Clinton was constrained in responding to the Brothers to the Rescue shootdown because of a fear of Cuban counterattacks. 
It was my intention that this report would force the Defense Department to assess Cuban capabilities to threaten the United States and, since Castro has a long record of using his capability against the United States, prepare contingency plans to respond to any threat from Cuba. We should not be caught off guard, unable to respond again. 
Press reports that the Department of Defense assessment finds no national security threat from Cuba are very troubling. Just two years ago, Cuban Air Force MiGs shot down two unarmed civilian aircraft over international waters, killing three United States citizens. Although U.S. forces monitored the entire event, no U.S. forces were able to respond. Our advanced fighter aircraft never got off the ground. 
Equally as troubling as this type of conventional threat are the non-traditional threats posed by Cuba. Biological and chemical weapons, intelligence collection activities, immigration crises, 
drug trafficking, and dangerous nuclear and information warfare programs all pose national security threats to the United States. 
At the same time, U.S. capability to deal with these threats continues to erode. A series of base closure decisions have reduced capability in the areas that provide the most direct capacity to respond to Cuban provocations. With the realignment of Homestead Air Force Base and Key West Naval Air Station, we are in a worse posture than in 1996 when the shootdown occurred. 
Mr. President, let me mention a few of the known Cuban capabilities that cannot be overlooked. First, a significant conventional military capability exists that can harm United States interests, as demonstrated by the 1996 shootdown. In addition, Jane's Defense Weekly reported last summer that Castro is training elite special force units in Vietnam which are prepared to attack U.S. military targets during a final confrontation. NBC News reported in 1995 that Cuba has operated a special military training school since the mid-1980's named the Baragua School in Los Palacios, Pinar del Rio, in a region known as El Cacho. It reportedly trains some 2,500 men and specializes in commando attacks and infiltration of other countries. 
Castro's capability to produce weapons of mass destruction is even more worrisome, particularly his ability to produce biological weapons. There is no question that the capability exists. Cuba has a developed pharmaceutical industry and a network of biological `institutes' which could be used for more than simply scientific research. Many of Cuba's engineers and scientists have been trained in former-communist countries such as East Germany and Russia and have ample training to cultivate biological weapons. Biological weapons are the easiest to conceal and acquire because of the dual-use nature of the technology. 
Another major threat to U.S. national security is the intelligence collection facilities in Cuba that can intercept all electronic transmissions, emanating from the east coast of the United States. The 28 acre Russian intelligence facility at Lourdes has two electronic satellite dishes aimed at the United States which can intercept phone calls, faxes, and computer data from the entire Eastern seaboard. Russia and Cuba renegotiated a $200 million annual lease for the site in 1995. According to U.S. intelligence analysts, one dish listens in on general U.S. communications, the other is used for targeted eavesdropping. The facility employs 800 Russian technicians and linguists. An example of the danger this facility poses to U.S. national security is the fact that during the Gulf War, the station's specialists intercepted the details of the U.S. military battle plans and were prepared to disclose these plans to Iraq and other U.S. enemies. 
The Russians have spent nearly $3 billion on Lourdes and sources say that the Russians are upgrading its reach. In addition, the operation at Lourdes is extremely sophisticated. According to U.S. intelligence sources, the Russians program the computers at Lourdes to listen for specific phone numbers. When they detect those lines are in use, the computers automatically record the conversations or transmissions. For priority targets, an alarm signals a Russian linguist who will actually listen in. 
The Castro regime has also used mass migration as a policy tool. There have been two major refugee crises which have posed a security threat to the U.S. In 1980, 125,000 Cubans came to 
the U.S. in the `Mariel Boatlift.' In 1994, another 32,000 Cubans left Cuba by boat and were picked up at sea by the U.S. Coast Guard. In the Mariel crisis, the Cuban government encouraged criminals and mental patients to leave, causing additional security problems for the United States. 
The problem of dealing with a large influx of refugees, whether criminal or not, gives Castro a weapon he can use to threaten the United States. Mass immigration represents a form of leverage Castro can use to extract concessions from the U.S. on a number of issues. 
Cuba also has a dormant nuclear capability that can threaten the United States. Sergei Shoigu, Minister of Emergency Situations in Russia, has recently confirmed that Russia and Cuba will forge ahead to finish constructing the Juragua nuclear plant on Cuba's south coast. The Juragua facility is known to be unsafe in both construction and design. A nuclear accident at Juragua would send a radioactive cloud over the lower tier of the U.S. to Texas or up to the East Coast to Washington, D.C. within the first four days, depending on the season and prevailing winds. According to a National Oceanographic and Atmosphere Administration study, an estimated 50-80 million Americans from Florida to Texas could be exposed to dangerous levels of radioactivity.

Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I strongly support Senator Lautenberg's amendment to increase funding for the protection of the environment and our nation's natural resources. This important amendment would establish an environmental reserve fund, so that receipts from a reinstated Superfund tax can be used for environmental protection initiatives. 
The environmental and natural resources programs funded in the President's Budget are critical to our efforts to protect these resources which are so vital to our society. 
Several critical programs proposed by the President are not included in the Budget Resolution. Among others, these include operations and maintenance funds for the administration of the National Wildlife Refuge System and program support for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's execution of the Endangered Species Act. Both of these programs are critical to the State of Florida and our ability to protect and preserve unique ecosystems, habitats, and species. 
Today's 93 million acre National Wildlife Refuge System has its roots in the state of Florida. It was public outrage over the devastation of wading bird populations in Florida that led to the establishment of the Pelican Island Federal Bird Reservation in 1903. This action is recognized as the genesis of the National Wildlife Refuge System. 
Each year, nearly 30 million people visit our National Wildlife Refuges and enjoy activities such as wildlife observation, hiking, fishing, photography, hunting, and environmental education. These lands are home to millions of migrating birds, big game, and hundreds of critically endangered species. 
In the State of Florida, there are 25 National Wildlife Refuges that are an essential part of our natural heritage. I learned this lesson firsthand in May 1990 when I did my 241st workday at the `Ding' Darling Wildlife Refuge on Sanibel Island. Working with refuge naturalists, I spent the day surveying the refuge's bird population, cleaning up mangrove areas, reinforcing water retention ponds and speaking with local citizens who had a keen interest in the refuge's future. 
I also learned that the success of wildlife refuges since 1903 had occurred not because of any action taken by the House or Senate, but in spite of congressional neglect. While Congress has been willing to fund refuges, it had failed to ascribe a mission for the refuge system or clearly define environmental objectives for each individual refuge. 
This situation was corrected with the passage of the National Wildlife Refuge System Improvement Act in 1997. I was pleased to play an instrumental role in this law's enactment. It provides new protection to the more than 500 national wildlife refuges, and is a great step forward in our efforts to preserve the unique species and ecosystems located in these areas. 
However, these lands must be maintained if they are to remain national treasures. The President has requested an increase of $25.8 million in FY 99 for the Fish and Wildlife Service operation and maintenance of the National Wildlife Refuge System. These funds would be used in the State of Florida for projects such as protection of the Florida Panther in the Ten Thousand Islands National Wildlife Refuge. They would support the Florida Keys Invasive Exotics Task Force, which is working to protect the Florida Keys from invasive exotic plants which threaten the restoration of the South Florida Ecosystem. 
The current budget resolution does not support this increase. The Lautenberg Amendment, which I have co-sponsored, will help ensure that the National Wildlife Refuge system receives the funds that are so critical to its future. 
In addition to the National Wildlife Refuge System, the President's Budget request for an increase of $35.7 million in FY99 for the Fish and Wildlife Service's threatened and endangered species program is a critical element in our ongoing efforts to improve the level of protection of endangered species. As currently written, the Senate Budget Resolution does meet the President's request. Senator Lautenberg's amendment will give us the opportunity to review this decision and provide the required funds to this critical program. 
I believe that the Endangered Species Act is one of our nation's most critical environmental statutes. While it goes without saying that the Act could be more effective in recovering endangered and threatened species, I believe that the ESA has helped to forestall further declines and possibly even the extinction of many of our most imperiled species. 
Senate approval of this Amendment will give us the ability to review the current needs of the ESA program and appropriate the required funds to support these programs. 
Funding for implementation of the ESA is critical both today and into the future. As the Senate considers the Endangered Species Reauthorization Bill introduced by Senators Chafee, Baucus, Kempthorne, and Reid, our commitment to provide funds to support the revisions in the ESA Reauthorization Bill will be essential. Without this commitment, we run the risk of losing an opportunity to boost the worthy cause of endangered species conservation.

Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleagues, Senator John Chafee and Senator Tom Harkin, to introduce the Kids Deserve Freedom from Tobacco Act of 1998, legislation which if passed will have a monumental effect on the number one public health problem facing America's youth: underage smoking. 
This legislation is the first bipartisan, comprehensive piece of legislation which has the support of the Administration and the public health community. Since the beginning of this school year, more than half a million kids have started smoking. If we don't act soon, another half million children will take up the habit by the start of the next school year. And by its inaction, Congress will have signed their death warrants. 
In Florida alone, where minors purchase more than 12 million packs of cigarettes each year, 28% of high school students currently smoke cigarettes. Nationally, the number is closer to 35%. The KIDS Act takes a number of strong actions--all of which would be funded by the industry's annual $25 billion payment--to lower the rate of youth and teenage smoking. These include:

 Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, it is with great pleasure that I bring to the Senate's attention the distinguished service of the former United States Ambassador to Spain, Richard Gardner. Ambassador Gardner concluded his service on July 12, 1997. During his tenure, Ambassador Gardner performed his diplomatic duties with grace and distinction. As a result of his outstanding work, the relationship between the United States and Spain has been immeasurably strengthened. 
The ambassador has received praise and high marks for his exemplary performance from a number of observers. For example, Spanish journalists have commented on his successful efforts to increase private donations for student exchange program, which provide expanded opportunities for cultural and academic interaction between United States and Spanish citizens. In a more formal capacity, Ambassador Gardner's efforts facilitated an improved, and mutually beneficial, trade relationship between our countries and enhanced relations between our respective governments. 
One aspect of Ambassador Gardner's work of which I am very familiar is his instrumental role in establishing the United States-Spain Council. Founded in 1995, the Council has grown to become an important institution for the development and enhancement of United States-Spain relations. Its mission is to encourage understanding of our shared interests and to promote constructive relations and cooperation between the Spanish and American governments on a variety of important issues, including, trade, intellectual property rights, and education. Currently, I am the chairman of the council. Its membership includes a diverse group of business, academic, and government leaders. 
Mr. President, Ambassador Gardner served his country with great distinction and conducted himself in a manner worthy of the respect and admiration of all Americans. Diplomats serve as liaisons and are the most visible representatives of their home countries. In this capacity, Ambassador Gardner exemplified the best our country has to offer. He will be sorely missed by the many colleagues and friends he has left behind. Luckily, he will continue to serve our country through his work in the private sector and on the United States-Spain Council.

Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, in this period for morning business, I would like to discuss with my colleagues a provision which will be contained in the legislation introduced by the Senator from Georgia, Senator Coverdell, relative to education. This provision relates to public school construction. 
Mr. President, as you and others in this Chamber and millions of Americans know, we are facing a near crisis in terms of the construction of public school facilities. Too many communities in America have schools which are crumbling because of age and inattention. Other communities have dramatically oversized classrooms because they do not have the financing to build enough new schools to meet their exploding student population. 
There is no simple answer to this issue. The General Accounting Office recently estimated that it would cost about $112 billion to repair our schools sufficiently to bring them into good condition. Additionally, although there is no single authoritative source of information on the need for new school construction, that cost is also estimated in the range of $110 billion to $120. 
It is clear to me, and to others who have looked at this issue, that we need to look for opportunities to provide flexibility to school districts in responding to this massive need for school construction and repair. If I can quote Mr. Roger Cuevas, who is the superintendent of schools for Dade County, FL, when he recently wrote:  
It is important that financing options be defined in as flexible a manner as possible and especially not be limited to general obligation bonds . . . Flexibility in the choice of the type of eligible debt financing, as well as the capacity of the program to adapt to State-by-State differences are as critical to all school districts in the Nation as is its funding level. 
The provision which will be contained in the legislation of Senator Coverdell provides for public school construction the same opportunities which are currently available in a wide variety of other public-need areas; namely, airports, seaports, mass transit facilities, water and sewer facilities, solid waste disposal facilities, qualified residential rental projects, local furnishing of electric energy and gas, heating and cooling facilities, qualified hazardous waste facilities, high-speed inter-city rail facilities and environmental enhancements of hydroelectric generating facilities. In all of those 12 separate areas, the U.S. Congress has provided assistance in the financing through what is known as private activity bonds. 
This legislation adds a 13th category for public schools. This new category builds upon the experience that already exists from using private activity bonds to finance transportation, energy, environmental, and housing projects. 
What would be the essence of this proposal? This proposal would provide to each State the opportunity to issue tax-exempt private activity bonds to finance construction of public schools. These bonds would be administered at the State level, just as are the other 12 categories of private activity bonds. States containing school districts experiencing high growth would be allowed to issue bonds each year in an amount equal to $10 multiplied by the population of the State. For example, if a State with high-growth school districts has a population of 5 million, it could issue up to $50 million of bonds to finance school construction. A high-growth school district is defined as one with 
an enrollment of at least 5,000 students and the enrollment has grown by at least 20 percent during the five years previous to the year of bond issue. States without high-growth school districts would still receive $5 million of bond authority. 
Potentially, this could provide to the Nation bonding capacity for public school construction of about $2.5 billion a year, if each State fully participates. That would be a noticeable contribution toward the enormous need that the Nation faces for financing the construction of new public schools and the rehabilitation of old ones. 
More important, it would provide a new source of financing for public school construction, because the nature of private activity bonds involves a partnership between a public agency--in this case typically a local school district--and a private entity. A typical example of what would be anticipated under this legislation would be that a school district needing to build two new elementary schools would solicit requests from the private sector for the construction and financing of those schools. The school district would select which of the proposals that best served the interest of that school district. The school district would then enter into a leaseback arrangement where the private builder would construct the building, would be responsible for paying the indebtedness on the private activity bonds and, at the end of the lease term, would turn the facilities over to the school system with no additional consideration. This would allow the school district to take advantage of private sector innovation in design and construction, as well as the private sector involvement in financing. 
I might say that I had an opportunity in October of last year during one of my monthly work days to work on McNiclo Middle School in Hollywood, FL, which was being built under this type of arrangement, although the financing was the conventional type of general obligation bond financing. In this case, because the contractor was doing a design-and-build project, the construction time and cost were less than they would have been under standard procedures. 
There happened to even be a third benefit. This school was being built not only to meet educational standards, but also was being further strengthened so that it would serve as a community shelter in the event of a hurricane or other emergency situation. This legislation seeks to encourage and accelerate those kinds of innovative public-private relationships. 
So, with this description, I hope that my colleagues will see the benefit of the flexibility and creativity that this provision will bring and the appropriateness of the Federal Government offering this degree of assistance to our public schools, just as it has in a whole variety of other public activities. 
The Federal Government is not intruding into areas of curriculum or personnel or other aspects of education which are the appropriate responsibility of the local school district. But we are extending a hand to States and local governments to help them see that all American children go into a classroom which is safe, which is adequate, which meets modern educational needs and into a school in which there are sufficient classrooms so that there can be that relationship between the teacher and the student that will advance quality education. 
Thank you, Mr. President.

Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I commend my friend and colleague, Senator Mack, for having brought this fundamental issue to the Senate at the earliest opportunity that was available to have this matter debated. It had been our understanding and advice that it was on the amendment offered by the Finance Committee that the amendment that Senator Mack brings to us today to repeal the 4.3-cent deficit reduction tax, which was adopted in 1993, would be germane and appropriate. So we offer it to our colleagues at this earliest opportunity. 
Mr. President, I believe that there are a number of fundamental issues raised by this amendment. The first of those is the obvious, and that is that the United States is a federal system. We have the opportunities for the needs of our people to be met, as the Presiding Officer knows well as a former Governor of one of our States, by action at the State level, or by action at the national level where appropriate, and as illustrated by the transportation system, a merger of State and Federal initiatives. So the statement that is made that if we repeal these funds, it will have a serious adverse and continuous effect on our transportation system ignores the fact that (a) these funds were not levied for the purposes of transportation and, up until this proposal that is before us today, these funds have never been spent for transportation, and, third, that we are in essence returning to the States the fiscal capacity which they can decide to use for transportation. 
So we are not, in this amendment, hostile to the needs of transportation. We are particularly aware of those needs in a rapidly growing State. Our position is, however, that this degree of capacity to meet transportation needs should be at the States' discretion. The States should decide whether they wish to use this amount of resources to expand their transportation needs, and we should not arrogate that decision to us to make by shifting a tax initially levied for one purpose, deficit reduction, to a new purpose, transportation spending. 
Second is the enormity of the decision that we are about to make. The Interstate Highway System and the current Federal highway trust fund both came into being in the mid 1950s during the administration of President Dwight Eisenhower. President Eisenhower had a great vision for this Nation, which was that it would be linked by a system of the most modern highways. The Nation accepted that vision and, in 1957, we launched this goal. 
In that year, 1957, as we were starting the National Interstate Highway System, this Congress determined that the appropriate level of funding to commence the project was $2.1 billion. That is what was spent in the first year of the Interstate Highway System. Fifteen years later, in 1973, the system was well underway. Its tentacles were beginning to reach across America. Suburbs were being united by modern highway systems with major cities. Cities were being connected. Regions were being brought together in a national interstate highway system upon which we spent, in the 1973 Highway Act, $5.9 billion a year, for a total under that act of $17.8 billion for 3 years. 
In 1976, as the system continued to expand, in my State, as it was reaching down the east coast, what is now Interstate 95, we were spending $8.7 billion a year on the Interstate Highway System. In 1978, as we were beginning to complete some of the major systems within our largest cities, we were spending $12.8 billion on the Interstate Highway System. Those numbers continued to grow until, by 1987, we were spending $14 billion a year on the Interstate Highway System, and I am pleased to announce that we brought it to completion. 
In fact, the last segment of the original Interstate Highway System that was completed was I-595 in Broward County, FL. A celebration should be held at that site where the last bit of asphalt and concrete were poured to complete a half century of America's effort to build the Interstate Highway System. When we passed ISTEA I in 1991, we declared this to be the first post-Interstate Highway System bill. Our actions were not quite consistent with the rhetoric because, in the first year after completion of the Interstate Highway System, we spent $20.4 billion a year on highways--more than $6 billion more than we were spending in the last year when we were completing the Interstate Highway System. 
Now, today, we are proposing to pass a bill, which started at $145 billion over a 6-year period, which has now reached $173 billion over a 6-year period, for an average over that time of $28.8 billion. So we are going to be spending, in the period that is now almost 10 years after the completion of the system, approximately $14 billion, more than 100 percent more per year than we were spending in the last year of completing the Interstate Highway System.

Mr. GRAHAM. Madam President, I say enough is enough. We have finished our task. We have built the Interstate Highway System that was President Dwight Eisenhower's vision. This is the time to begin to ask the question: What is the Federal role in transportation? What is our next step in terms of meeting the transportation needs of the American citizen? 
I do not believe it is appropriate at this time to be doubling the amount of Federal expenditures over what we were spending as we were completing the very purpose for the Federal highway trust fund, which was the Interstate Highway System. 
Third, there is the issue of: Is this a fair tax? The Senate has considered that issue at great length. We considered it in 1993 when the tax was imposed as part of the deficit reduction program. This tax was not passed to add to the spending on the transportation system. Rather it was to reduce the Federal deficit. 
In 1996, recognizing that fact and recognizing that we were moving rapidly toward an elimination of the deficit, and at a time when there was a spike in gasoline taxes, our then colleague, Senator Bob Dole, offered an amendment to repeal the 4.3 cents. On the 14th of May of 1996, we had a vote on a cloture motion to close down debate and to proceed to vote on Senator Dole's proposal to repeal the 4.3 cents. 
I might say that I opposed the repeal of the 4.3 cents because I felt we needed to retain those funds in the General Treasury until such time as we had in fact achieved the objective of eliminating the Federal deficit. But 54 of our 100 Members on the 14th of May of 1996 voted to invoke cloture and bring to a vote the proposal to repeal the 4.3 cents tax. There were many arguments made at that time in favor of that repeal. 
I will quote from one of those, which was given by the senior Senator from Texas which related to the issue of the fundamental unfairness of this 4.3 cents tax. The Senator stated on the 14th of May of 1996: 
We, therefore, created through this gasoline tax an incredible redistribution of income and wealth. The Clinton gasoline tax imposed a new burden on people who drive to work for a living in order to subsidize people who, by and large, do not go to work. We have an opportunity in this pending amendment to solve this problem by repealing this gasoline tax, thereby eliminating this burden on people who have to drive their cars and trucks great distances to earn a living. In my State it is not uncommon for someone to drive 40 miles from where they work, and, as a result, a gasoline tax imposes a very heavy burden on them. We have an opportunity to eliminate this inequity by repealing the 4.3-cents-a-gallon tax on gasoline--a permanent gas tax that for the first time ever went into the general revenue to fund social programs instead of paying for highway construction. 
Madam President, we have that same opportunity again today to repeal this 4.3-cents tax, which is imposing this very heavy burden on many of our people. 
Finally, Madam President, on the issue of a national system or a parochial transportation system at the original recommended authorization level of $145 billion, which is the level recommended by the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works, we would have been spending approximately $23 billion more on the highway system under ISTEA II than we spent on the highway system under ISTEA I since 1991. So there was a substantial increase in highway spending already recommended. On top of that, we have added an additional almost $29 billion of highway spending. 
How have we chosen to distribute this money? I come from a State which, since the inception of the highway system, the Interstate Highway System in 1957, has been a donor State; that is, we have contributed more each year into the fund than we have received back from the fund. This was to be the year in which we would make a major breakthrough in terms of equity in the distribution of funds. 
I will say in commendation to the Senator from Virginia, the Senator from Rhode Island, and the Senator from Montana that we have made substantial progress in ISTEA II in terms of that goal of equity.

Mr. GRAHAM. Madam President, I appreciate that generous comment, which is typical of my friend from Virginia, with whom I was pleased to join as an original cosponsor of what we call step 21. Step 21 had as a central goal to provide that, of those funds which came into the Federal highway trust fund, 95 percent of those funds would be returned to the contributing States, thus leaving 5 percent of the total to be available to meet national needs as determined by this Congress. When we were debating step 21 and the various alternatives for the Federal highway program, it was determined that there was not an adequate amount of money left to meet national needs, if 95 percent was returned to the contributing State. So two changes 
were made. 
One change was to lower the percentage from 95 percent to 90 percent, and the second was to change the base upon which the percentage was applied from the amount that each State contributed to the fund to the amount which each State received from the fund for formula programs, which now is that approximately 91 to 92 percent of all of the funds which will be distributed will come through one of these formula programs. 
The rationale for stepping back from that original goal of equity of 95 percent of contributions into the fund was that there were insufficient dollars in order to be able to achieve that level of equity. The concern of many today is that we have now added almost $29 billion to the original $145 billion of highway funds, and, yet, we have made only marginal progress towards that original goal of equity. We still are going to utilize not a percentage of the money going into the fund but rather a percentage of money coming out of the fund under the formula programs. And we have increased the percentage from 90 to 91 percent, albeit even that is going to be subject to a variety of factors that will occur over the next 6 years as to whether a true 91 percent is established as the floor. 
Madam President, I believe we missed a major opportunity, if these new funds were going to be available, to use them, first, to achieve the goal of equity, which was established as a principal objective, and then to use the balance for those things that we considered to be of a national priority. 
So, with that history, I conclude that the best course of action for the additional funds which were adopted in 1993 as a deficit reduction measure, not a transportation measure, and which we have failed to use in the way to maximize the achievement of equity, is to say the appropriate thing to do is to follow the advice of our colleagues who spoke with such eloquence in 1993 and 1996 and terminate this tax at the Federal level. 
Let us give our citizens tax relief. It would represent tax relief of approximately $6 billion a year to the American motorist by repealing this tax at the Federal level. I would not suggest that the American motorist should immediately begin putting those dollars in their wallets, because we are essentially releasing that capacity to the States so the States can decide whether they wish to utilize these funds by levying part or all of this as a State gasoline tax, therefore using those funds to meet needs which people in the States and communities of America identify to be of the greatest priority. 
I believe that is in the spirit of this new Congress and its emphasis on placing authority and responsibility as close to the people as possible. I believe we can say that we are able to meet our national transportation responsibilities with approximately an additional $23 billion above what we are spending in the current transportation bill without having to utilize this 4.3 cents. 
I believe that we would come closer to our goal of equity by allowing the States, unencumbered by all of the Federal constraints and regulatory requirements and the sheer expense of shipping people's money from Maine to Washington and then back to Maine--let it stay in Maine and not be subjected to any of the transactional costs of coming through Washington. Let the people of Florida, let the people of North Dakota, California, West Virginia, Virginia, Montana, and every other State decide what they want to do with the 4.3 cents if they choose to levy it for their transportation needs. 
So I commend my colleague for his tenacity in raising this opportunity to provide tax relief, enhance federalism, and to truly recognize that we have celebrated the victory of completion of the Interstate System, that we are in a new era, and that we should recognize and act as if we are in that new era. 
Thank you, Madam President. 
Several Senators addressed the Chair.

Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I will soon send to the desk an amendment which will provide for three additional criteria to be added to the current five criteria that are utilized for purposes of the Federal Transit Authority's determination of the validity of a New Start application. 
These three additional criteria are population density and current transit ridership, the technical capability of the applicant to construct the project, and the degree of local financial commitment to the project, including the degree to which the local community has overmatched the project. 
The purpose of these three are to add three relatively quantifiable factors to the five existing factors that will be used by the Congress and by the Federal Transit Administration in determining which of the New Start applications are appropriate for Federal participation. 
I urge adoption of the amendment on behalf of Senator Murray and myself.

Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, it has been a great pleasure to work with the Senator from Oregon over the last several months in the development of this legislation. I share the assessment of the Senator from Montana. It will be seen as one of the most important new ideas in highway transportation planning. 
Basically, it is consistent with the evolution that has occurred within the American environmental movement. It wasn't too many years ago that a principal goal of many who described themselves as being environmentalists was to achieve the goal of no growth, no action. It was essentially a negative and defensive posture. As the environmental movement has become a more pervasive part of our society in the way in which we look at our responsibility, it has become a movement which attempts to shape the future in an affirmative way that is sensitive to environmental considerations rather than stagnate in the status quo. 
I believe this amendment is part of that evolutionary process, because what it basically says is, let us ask everyone who is a stakeholder in a major Federal participatory transportation project to sit down at the table when the project is in its conceptual form. If there is a problem with this project that is going to render it incapable of ever being permitted, let's put that on the table at the beginning, and, if the project will fundamentally change it, relocate it to a more appropriate site, or whatever is necessary. 
If, on the other hand, it is not inherently flawed but there are going to have to be modifications in the design or construction techniques, let's know that at the beginning of the process so that everyone is operating from a position of candor and openness. 
Unfortunately, the opposite of what I just described is what happens too often today; that is, that these requirements are not disclosed until the project has been many years in planning and design and millions of dollars spent, and then you find out that there are these flaws, or fatal conditions, or issues that will require a similar investment of time and money for redesign. 
So I think this is an amendment that will advance the modern approach to environmentalism and reduce the legitimate public anger and frustration when they see millions of dollars and years of time being discarded because of issues raised at the end of the process, and it will build a new level of confidence and a higher level of environmental sensitivity in our transportation planning. 
So I am strongly supportive of this amendment. I appreciate the leadership that so many Members of this Chamber have given to this. I particularly commend my friend and colleague from Oregon and urge that the full Senate join in support of this and that we see when this bill is negotiated with the House of Representatives that the provision will be included in any final legislation that is sent to the President for his signature.

Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I join with my colleague, Senator D'Amato, Senator Moynihan, Senator Biden and others in cosponsoring the innocent spouse legislation. 
Under existing law, married taxpayers are liable for their spouse's Federal income taxes when they file a joint return. This is true regardless of which spouse earns what income, which spouse is responsible for expenses that qualify as deductions or credits. Each spouse is potentially liable for all of the couple's tax debts. You might ask why do couples agree to take on each other's debts. There are probably multiple reasons. For one, many couples want to intermingle all their finances as part of their marriage. Most couples filing jointly reduce the couple's overall tax liability. Most married couples do not contemplate a subsequent separation or divorce and unpaid taxes when they file a joint return. 
Unfortunately, separations and divorces do occur. It is in dividing up the assets and liabilities of the marriage that many women discover that their ex-husband erred on the joint tax return and that the IRS is in pursuit of the unpaid taxes. The Finance Committee hearings and reports issued by the Treasury Department demonstrate that many times the IRS does not focus on collecting money from the ex-husband either because he cannot be found as easily or because he has few assets or income-earning potential. Instead, it is the innocent spouse who becomes the target of the collection effort. This is true despite the fact that when the return was completed and filed the wife may have had little or no income and may have had little, if any, knowledge about the couple's financial affairs. 
If I could use as a specific example that illustrates literally thousands of cases, one of the witnesses who testified before the Finance Committee at the February 11, 1998, meeting was Ms. Karen Andreasen of Tampa, FL. Here is her story. Unfortunately it is all too topical of many American women. 
Ms. Andreasen testified that her husband, who ironically was a former IRS employee and financial consultant operating his own business, had handled most of the family's financial affairs including completing tax returns. When the couple decided to divorce, Ms. Andreasen learned that the couple had significant potential IRS debts. She testified that her ex-husband had forged her name on joint returns, yet the IRS was holding her responsible for the tax liability resulting from her ex-husband's business. Even though Ms. Andreasen had no individual income for the years in question, she had been saddled for several years with the obligation for her husband's taxes, and her home today remains subject to a tax lien. 
Why doesn't our current tax law provide protection for innocent spouses such as Ms. Andreasen? Well, Congress did pass what is called the innocent spouse rule several years ago. Under this law, in certain narrow circumstances, a spouse can be relieved of liability for taxes assessed by an IRS audit after a joint return is filed. However, its provisions are so complicated and narrow that few can meet all of its tests. There is a growing acceptance of the principle that now Congress needs to change the rules. 
In 1995, the American Bar Association recommended the legislation which is being introduced today. The House has taken a different approach. It has adopted as part of its IRS reform bill liberalizations in the innocent spouse rule for purposes of providing relief to more innocent spouses. Even the Treasury and the IRS have acknowledged the need for reform and 
have already taken steps to provide taxpayers with more information regarding the current innocent spouse rules. They have also suggested several statutory and regulatory changes which would expand the innocent spouse provisions to accommodate more cases. However, neither the House bill nor the Treasury's proposals will solve the underlying problem. We must grant individuals fair treatment where the individual spouse makes an error on the return. To do that, we must allow individuals to take responsibility for their individual share of the joint tax liability. 
The legislation which has been introduced today provides that all married taxpayers be taxed only on their individual incomes. The bill would not eliminate joint filing. It would not change the tax tables to eliminate the reduced taxes that many times accompany joint filings. The bill does simply say that if the IRS asserts a tax deficiency on a joint return, each spouse will be individually liable for his or her portion of the liability. 
In other words, income and deductions attributable to activities will be used to calculate the husband's portion of the tax liability and a similar calculation of the wife or ex-wife's portion of the tax liability. 
The bill specifically provides that it will be applicable to all open tax cases, including ones originating in years prior to the date of enactment. Mr. President, this legislation provides that its application will be retroactive to current open tax cases. This approach will guarantee relief for Karen Andreasen and the many other spouses who have, through no fault of their own, been placed in extreme financial and emotional distress. 
Repealing the joint liability of spouses will simply the tax system and it will give the IRS clear guidance as to where to go to collect tax debts. 
I want to thank Senator Roth for organizing a thorough examination of the IRS in preparation for markup of the Internal Revenue Service reform bill. The legislation Senator D'Amato, others, and I introduce today was generated as a result of that thorough investigation. 
Mr. President, there have been unknown thousands of innocent spouses who have been subjected to extreme emotional and financial distress solely because they filed joint returns with their spouses. This legislation establishes fundamental equity in providing that each individual is responsible for his or her own actions, but will not be held accountable for actions or conduct of another. 
By applying this legislation retroactively to currently open cases, we will provide significant and immediate relief to those who have been unfairly charged with taxes they did not rightly owe. We will establish the principle that liability for an erroneous item tracks responsibility and will force the IRS to collect taxes from the person who rightfully owes those taxes.

Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I am extremely pleased to join with my distinguished colleague from Florida, Senator Mack, in introducing the Florida Federal Judgeship Act of 1998. 
This legislation will create six additional U.S. District Court judgeships in Florida--two in the Southern District and four--three permanent and one temporary--in the fast-growing Middle District of Florida. 
Mr. President, make no mistake: Florida's federal courts are in the midst of a full-blown crisis. Currently, the Miami-based Southern District has sixteen judges. The Middle District, which also includes the Jacksonville, Tampa, St. Petersburg, Orlando, Sarasota, and Fort Myers metropolitan areas, has eleven. 
Because this number of judgeships is too small to meet the increasing demand of Florida's rapidly growing population, judges face overwhelming caseloads, and the public faces a denial of justice. 
Prosecutors and law-enforcement personnel are stymied in their efforts to mete out swift justice. 
Civil litigants are forced to endure unreasonable waits to bring their cases to resolution. 
Prominent legal and judicial officials all over Florida have told us that this is not a tenable situation. 
For example, Middle District U.S. Attorney Charles Wilson, whose office is responsible for bringing alleged criminals to trial, has said that the judicial shortage has a `negative and severe' effect on the work of federal prosecutors and law enforcement officials. 
Floridians are not alone in their concern about overcrowded court dockets. 
In September 1996, the Judicial Conference of the United States--the principal policy-making body of the Federal judiciary, which is chaired by the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States and comprised of Federal judges from throughout the United States--asked Congress to create four new judgeships in the Middle District and two in the Southern--precisely what our legislation would authorize. 
Senator Mack and I are introducing our bill so that Congress can meet the urgent request of the Judicial Conference, and provide the additional judicial resources needed for these two U.S. District Courts to meet their increasing caseload. 
We are certain that many States have justifiable concerns about overcrowded Federal District Court dockets. I hope that this Congress this year will meet those needs by considering and adopting the recommendations that the Judicial Conference of the United States submitted to us almost a year and a half ago. 
But we also believe that the urgent nature of Florida's judicial crisis makes our State a special case. 
I am going to be saying some things about Florida of which I am not proud. They are not positive. But they happen to be the facts as to the circumstances that our Federal courts face. 
First, Florida has one of the highest caseloads per judge in the Nation. 
For the last several years, the Judicial Conference has proposed all recommendations for increased judgeship based on weighted filings--a number that takes into account both the total number of cases filed per judge and the level of case complexity. 
I would like to note that this is a retrospective look. The Judicial Conference looks at prior history, in terms of evaluating future needs. In the case of the State of Florida, because of the rapid growth, which I will soon detail, and because of the time required--a year and a half has already passed since the Judicial Conference did the calculations that I will soon review--Congress has not yet acted on its recommendation to authorize these additional positions. It would then require the process of actually filling those vacancies. So, there will be a gap of many months between the time that the numbers were calculated based on past history, as to what the need was, before relief in the form of an actual human being sitting at a bench to render justice will be in place. 
But looking back to the 1996 numbers, the Southern District's weighted filings stood at 588 per judge. 
This was 33 percent above the national average of 435 weighted filing per judge. 
In the Middle District, the story was even worse--623 weighted filings per judge, a figure that represented one of the highest in the entire nation. 
As a result, nearly 1,800 criminal defendants have cases pending in the Middle District. 
The story is even worse on the civil side of the docket, where more than 6,200 cases have yet to receive final disposition. 
In fact, the situation is so dire that Middle District Chief Judge Elizabeth Kovachevich has announced plans to shut down the Federal courthouses in Jacksonville and Orlando for 3 months this summer and recruit their judges, and any others from around the Nation who can spare the time, to tackle the growing civil case backlog in the Tampa Bay area. 
Innovative measures like this may help to alleviate the problem in the short-term. 
But the Florida caseload is not going to experience a slowdown in growth anytime soon, and the judicial backlog will get worse unless Congress takes preventative action for the long term. 
Second, this legislation recognizes that Florida's largest Federal judicial districts are responsible for a massive area that includes nearly 80 percent of Florida's 15 million residents. 
The Southern and Middle Districts combined jurisdiction stretches from Key West--the southernmost city in the continental United States--north to include Miami, Ft. Lauderdale, West Palm Beach, Melbourne, Fort Myers, Sarasota, Tampa, St. Petersburg, Orlando, and Jacksonville. 
Florida adds over 200,000 new permanent residents every year. 
Between 1980 and 1995, for example, the middle district grew by 52 percent, and it is expected to increase even from this elevated new level by an additional 21 percent in the next decade. 
However, since 1990, the last time Congress approved more judges for Florida, our United States district courts have not received any additional resources from the Federal Government to cope with this growth. 
Third, this proposal will assist the work of law enforcement officials. If we are committed to assuring that criminals face punishment that is both just but swift, we must be willing to provide resources to all aspects of the judicial system. 
In both the southern and middle districts, drug prosecutions and other serious criminal cases make up a large percentage of the total case files. For example, both the southern and middle districts have been designated by this Congress as high-intensity drug trafficking areas. These antidrug zones generate a substantial number of lengthy multidefendant prosecutions, and the addition of judges will help law enforcement officials and prosecutors in their fight against drug crimes. 
In addition, the Federal prosecutors and law enforcement officials throughout Florida, but especially in the southern and middle districts, are being forced to spend more time combating the cheats, the fly-by-night operators and the other criminals who are engaged in a systematic campaign to defraud and plunder our Medicare and other health care programs. 
Mr. President, as shocking as it is, it has been estimated that nearly 20 percent of all Medicare expenditures in the Southern District of Florida are lost to fraud. Nearly 30 percent of all Medicare fraud nationwide takes place in the State of Florida. 
In November of 1997, the new southern district U.S. Attorney Tom Scott pledged to create a comprehensive antifraud task force made up of local, State and Federal law enforcement officials to fight health care fraud. I am optimistic that this new effort will be successful in increasing the number of fraud offenders brought to justice. I am hopeful that it will deter others from entering this pernicious activity. But I am very concerned that unless the southern and middle districts have the adequate number of judges, many of these charlatans will not receive the swift and severe punishment they deserve. 
It is vital that we act quickly to resolve this crisis. Since 1991, filings have gone up 21 percent in the middle district; 30 percent in the southern district. Congress and the White House must be vigilant in their shared responsibility for recommending, nominating and confirming Federal judicial nominees. 
Mr. President, I commend Chairman Orrin Hatch, of the Judiciary Committee, and its membership, including our current Presiding Officer, for their recognition of the overcrowding problems facing Florida's Federal district courts. 
Last year, the Senate confirmed three Federal district judges--Donald Middlebrooks of West Palm Beach, Alan Gold of Miami, and Richard Lazzara of Tampa--to replace three judges who had retired or taken senior status. From late September of 1997, when Judge Lazzara was confirmed, until yesterday when the President nominated William P. Dimitrouleas of Fort Lauderdale and Judge Steven Mickle of Gainsville to fill openings in the Southern and Northern Districts of Florida, we had no judicial nominations pending before the Senate. 
Senator Hatch's and Members' leadership and understanding and their determination to address Florida's special needs are very much appreciated by the residents of our State. 
U.S. Federal district courts are the first stop for most citizens involved in the Federal judicial system. Most Federal cases are disposed of at the district court level. It is essential that these citizens have their claims heard in a timely manner. 
As the court caseload increases nationally, the Senate must be willing to expand judicial positions where they are needed. 
Our legislation is simple, sound and will serve the interest of America and will serve the interest of our State of Florida. 
I look forward to working with Senator Mack, with yourself and with the other members of the Judiciary Committee on this matter, Mr. President. I urge all my colleagues to support the passage of this much-needed legislation. For thousands of crime victims, for thousands of civil litigants in Florida's southern and middle judicial districts, justice delayed is rapidly becoming justice denied. 
Mr. President, I appreciate the opportunity to join my colleague, Senator Mack, in introducing this legislation.

 Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, we continue to see positive signs reflecting the strength of our national economy. Thirty-year mortgage rates remain low, consumer confidence is high and unemployment is down. 
In the midst of these sustained positive trends, America faces new challenges as we approach a new century. Among them: meeting a critical need for skilled technology workers and the continuing effort to move more Americans from welfare to work. 
We are an innovative people and I'm confident that we can meet new challenges, in part via public-private partnerships. One of the key people in America advancing the concept of public-private partnerships is Mr. Greg Farmer. As Florida's Secretary of Commerce, Mr. Farmer pioneered public-private partnerships at the state level, doing more with less tax dollars.

Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today on behalf of myself and my friend Senator Mack to introduce legislation authorizing the expansion of the Black Archives Research Center and Museum at the Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University in Tallahassee, Florida. 
This legislation is significant not only to the Florida A&M but to national heritage. Since 1977, the Black Archives at FAMU has been charged with collecting all materials reflecting the African-American presence and participation regionally, nationally and internationally. 
The Black Archives Research Center and Museum is the largest repository of African-American history in the Southeast. 
In 1997, Time magazine and Princeton Review chose Florida A&M University as the college of the year. This recognition is well deserved. Since 1992, Florida A&M University has vied with Harvard in enrolling the most National Achievement Scholars. (Florida A&M leading in 1992 and 1995 and Harvard in 1993 and 1994.) 
The Black Archives includes over 500,000 artifacts, manuscripts, art works and oral history tapes pre-dating the Civil War, through the early days of the civil rights movement to today. 
Unfortunately, this fine center finds itself in disrepair. 
The bill Senator Mack and I introduce today would authorize the design, and construction of a facility to better house these priceless documents for future generations. 
Our bill would stipulate that the State of Florida match the Federal investment dollar for dollar, making it truly a Federal-State partnership. 
Specifically, our bill would make the Black Archives Research Center and Museum eligible for up to $3.8 million in Federal funding beginning in 1998 and any succeeding years.

Mr. GRAHAM. I rise today to speak in support of legislation which Senator Mack and I filed last night, legislation that will bolster one of the most important components of our Nation's high-technology economic future, the space industry. 
For more than 40 years, my home State of Florida has been pleased, proud, and gratified to have been the launching pad for our Nation's exciting adventure in space. Our friend and colleague, Senator John Glenn's historic Friendship 7 mission was launched from Cape Canaveral. So were Neil Armstrong, Edwin Aldrin, and Michael Collins on their way to the first manned Moon landing. 
For the last 16 years, the world has watched intently as dozens of space shuttle missions have started at the Kennedy Space Center. 
But as we prepare for the increasingly high-technology, dynamic world of the 21st century, space will be more than just a place of exploration. In the 4 decades since the Soviet Union launched sputnik in October 1957, space has become a site for tremendous scientific innovation. Ball-point pens, velcro, and numerous other consumer products that make our lives easier are a direct result of the space program. 
Medical research has also reaped tremendous benefits from our time in space. And satellite technology has led to revolutionary advances in the way we forecast weather, protect the environment, and communicate with each other. 
Space may also revolutionize the way we transport goods and services and pursue other economic and business opportunities. In recognition of these advances, Senator Connie Mack and I are introducing the Commercial Space Act of 1997. 
Cape Canaveral is also home to the Florida Spaceport Authority, which is set to launch its first commercial payload from Launch Complex 46 in January 1998. This will be a milestone event in our State's history, and the bill that I am introducing today aims to modernize the laws that govern the United States' emerging commercial space industry. 
It is urgent that we develop a clear Federal policy for this important enterprise. For much of the last 40 years, our Nation's experiment in space has been in the exclusive domain of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration [NASA]. 
The legislation I am offering today recognizes that space is now a public and private sector place and enterprise. It aims to create a stable business environment for an industry that employs thousands of Americans and generates billions of dollars in economic activity each year. 
Our bill pursues this goal in several important ways. 
First, it will reduce the bureaucracy and redtape that plagues our regulation of the commercial space industry. Currently, the oversight of space-related businesses is scattered among multiple federal agencies, and burdens businesses with complex, confusing, and often conflicting rules. It is not an environment that encourages progress and innovation. 
This bill takes the first step toward clarity by requiring each relevant federal agency to clearly state its requirements for commercial space licensing. That requirement will help space businesses in their efforts to raise capital, develop a consistent business plan, and create new job opportunities within the commercial space industry. 
Second, our bill encourages federal agencies to act in a more efficient manner by increasing the private sector's involvement in servicing and launching space hardware, in addition to their current role in building rockets and satellites. This will bolster the expansion of the commercial space industry, while at the same time reducing Government costs and saving tax dollars. 
For example, this legislation would call for NASA to look at the role the private sector may play in operating, maintaining, and supplying the international space station. It would also encourage the conversion of old ballistic missiles into launch vehicles, a use that will reduce storage costs and provide for less expensive commercial space launches. 
Finally, it is imperative that we update existing Federal law to reflect the rapid pace of technological change. Mr. President, we cannot hope to prepare for the high-tech 21st century if the Federal Government maintains a 20th century mentality. Our laws should be flexible enough to adapt to a world in which new science and technology is created every minute. 
These goals will be difficult to achieve, however, if we do not recognize the role of State and local governments in reducing space costs. This is especially relevant to Florida, I am hopeful that our legislation will spur a robust and energized commercial space industry. Within 8 years, the number of launches in Florida are expected to double. But this potential growth can only be achieved if there exists a productive working relationship among all entities involved in the commercial space industry, including state and local governments. 
Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to tell you exactly what this legislation will accomplish: 
This bill will require NASA to submit a report that identifies and examines the prospects for commercial development, augmentation, or servicing of the international space station by the private sector. Private sector involvement in the commercial space industry is likely to reduce the costs of operating, maintaining and supplying the space station and will allow State governments to act as potential brokers in reducing space station costs. 
We amend the Commercial Space Launch Act and to give the Federal Government the authority to license commercial space reentry activities. This is an essential portion of the bill. Without this legal authorization, commercial reusable launch vehicles will not be allowed to re-enter the atmosphere, a restriction that would stymie the realization of important technological developments and investments by the commercial space industry. 
This bill reaffirms our Nation's plans to make the Global Positioning System [GPS] a world standard. GPS is a space-based system that individuals can use to determine their precise position on Earth. Although it began as a military/defense system, the GPS applications have expanded to other sectors. In addition, foreign governments are interested in entering this lucrative global market. Therefore, in an effort to protect our economic interests and our national security, it is imperative that the we encourage our President to enter into regional agreements with foreign governments to secure U.S. GPS as the unquestioned global standard. 
The legislation further requires the Federal Government to purchase both space hardware and transportation services from the private sector. This will encourage innovation within the commercial space industry, while simultaneously promoting greater cost efficiency and protecting our national security. 
This legislation allows the conversion of excess ICBM's into space transportation vehicles. These missiles cannot be used for defense purposes due to the START treaty. The conversion of these missiles could save taxpayer dollars by eliminating storage costs and providing cost effective launches for small scientific and educational payloads. 
Mr. President, I was extremely pleased when the House passed its version of this legislation earlier this week. It is my understanding that this legislation will be a priority for the Senate Commerce Committee when Congress returns from recess in 1998. 
I look forward to working with Chairman McCain, subcommittee Chairman Frist, my colleague, Senator Mack, and other members of the committee and the Clinton administration, to enact this important commercial space legislation.  
Mr. GREGG addressed the Chair.

Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I commend my colleagues on reaching an agreement on what has been a very long and difficult negotiation relative to Central American and other immigrants. I note that we have in the Chamber at this time two of the Members of the House of Representatives who have been most active in achieving this result that is close to being reality, Congresswoman Ileana Ros-Lehtinen and Congressman Lincoln Diaz-Balart. I extend my special thanks to them and congratulations on the success of their hard work. 
Many months ago, these two fine Members of the House of Representatives, and others, including Senator Mack, Senator Spencer Abraham, and Senator Kennedy, became interested in legislation that would provide justice and fairness for individuals who, due to duress, extreme hardship and political strife in their native countries, had been welcomed into our Nation by President Reagan and President Bush. I was proud to be part of this effort. 
The agreement reached with our distinguished colleagues covers not only Central Americans, but also other groups who have struggled against oppression. While I strongly believe that this agreement is positive and is in the American tradition of fair play, it is an incomplete resolution. It is incomplete because there is another relatively small group of persons who have the same characteristics as those who are being recognized for whom legislation is being passed today as part of the District of Columbia appropriations bill. That group is Haitians. 
There are 11,000 Haitians who, because of their credible asylum claims, were flown to the United States by our Government during the early 1990's. These were men, women and children, Mr. President, who had left Haiti because of the oppressive circumstances there. 
Mr. President, this group of approximately 11,000 Haitians, who because of credible asylum claims were allowed to enter the United States in the early 1990s, were part of a much larger group of over 40,000 Haitians who had been detained at sea and temporarily were in a refuge status at our Guantanamo naval station. 
These were the 11,000 of that larger group who were found, based on screenings administered by the Immigration Naturalization Service, to have a credible claim of persecution should they be returned to Haiti. The balance of those who could not meet that standard were in fact repatriated to Haiti. 
There is a second group of similar size and significant overlap in terms of the individuals who are part of the asylum backlog. These are those who have had pending asylum cases since 1995. 
Mr. President, I am pleased to be joined in introducing this legislation today which is entitled the Haitian Refugee Immigration Fairness Act of 1997, with my colleague Senator Mack, Senator Kennedy, Senator Abraham, and Senator Carol Moseley-Braun. 
Mr. President, fairness demands that we include this group in our legislation. First, this is a relatively small group. The two groups together, the Guantanamo asylees and those who have a pending asylum case combined, represent approximately 15,000 to 16,000 individuals. This, in relationship to those who we are providing essentially the same status to today, is a relatively small number. 
Second, this group has been extensively screened. As I indicated, the Guantanamo asylees represent approximately one out of four of those persons who were, at one time, at the Guantanamo Naval Base and who were found to have a credible legitimate fear of persecution in Haiti. 
I might say, Mr. President, as one who visited Haiti several times during this very tense period in the late 1980s and early 1990s, the level of human rights abuses, the savagery, the violence were extreme. And these persons who established if they had been returned to Haiti at that time, that they would have been significantly at risk, they were at risk in a very legitimately violent and hostile environment. 
Deportations of this group, Mr. President, have already begun. Asylum officers have begun to send back members of the Haitian community to Haiti. And so there is a sense of urgency of dealing with this legislation before any additional injustices are committed. 
And finally, the Guantanamo Haitians have established families in the United States. Many have had children born here who are United States citizens. They have opened businesses. They have built homes. They have strengthened our community here in the United States. They contribute to the diversity, the racial and social harmony, the positive traits of our increasingly multicultural Nation. 
Mr. President, I would hope someday to have the opportunity to invite you to join me at Miami Dade Community College, which happens to be the largest community college in the Nation based on enrollment. It is inspiring to go to that campus, one of their several campuses, and see the number of young Haitian men and women who are living the American dream of hard work and education and advancing themselves so that they can better serve the interests of their families and our Nation. 
This is a quality group of people who have made and will make significant contributions to our Nation. 
They are making a contribution in many ways today. As an example, we have in Haiti a large number of Americans of Haitian heritage who are currently serving as mentors to the newly established police force in Haiti. They are helping to make an organization which did not exist a few years ago because there was no police force, all police activities were done through the military and often done in a very aggressive manner. 
We are attempting to build a new institution to provide for security in Haiti. A key element of that are the large numbers of Americans of Haitian background who are assisting in that important effort within their former country. 
That is just one dramatic example of the contributions which this community is making to their new home in America. 
Mr. President, I ask my colleagues today to continue the fight for justice and fairness. We have taken a significant step in that effort tonight with the passage of the District of Columbia appropriations bill, which seems to be an odd place for such an important immigration bill to be lodged, but it is placed there. 
This legislation will continue that effort by applying a similar standard of fair treatment to this important population of Haitians within our Nation. 
I send to the desk the legislation and ask for its referral.

Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, the relationship between the United States and Spain is the oldest one in North America. Almost 500 years ago--in 1513--Spanish Explorer Ponce de Leon and his crew in search of a Fountain of Youth discovered North America. What they found was a treasure of a different kind--a land that Ponce de Leon named `La Florida.' 
In the four centuries since then, the histories of the United States and Spain have been inextricably linked. While there have been periods of estrangement and even hostility, the United States and Spain are `natural allies.' As we approach the end of this century, the cultural, political, and economic ties between the United States and Spain have never been stronger, nor more mutually beneficial. 
This reinvigorated relationship is especially visible in the active relations, frequently in close collaboration, of Spain and the United States in Latin America. 
To build on this exceptional period of positive relationship, the United States--Spain Council was formed in May 1996 by Vice President Al Gore and the President of Spain, Jose Maria Aznar. The Council was formerly established at an organizational meeting held in Toledo, Spain in November 1996. The Council established itself as a forum in which Spanish and American citizens, including leaders in government business, education, and culture could discuss the state of the United States--Spain relationship. 
In April of 1997 the Chairman of the Board of Trustees of the Fundacion Consejo Espana-Estados Unidos, Mr. Jaime Carvajal and the then Chairman of the United States--Spain Council, Bill Richardson, signed an agreement of the common goals regarding their intent to: promote cooperation between Spain and the United States in the economic, trade, business, scientific and cultural fields; improve knowledge about each other's country and the image of the United States in Spain and of Spain in the United States; propose to their respective governments actions aimed at developing relations between the two countries and adopt other initiatives which would contribute to the progress and growth of relations between the United States and Spanish societies. 
This past October 31 through November 2, 1997 the Council met here in Washington for two and one half days and in New York for an additional day on November 3, 1997. The meeting was attended by many prominent members of the Council from both nations, which led to a candid and thought provoking discussion of the topics on our agenda. 
These topics included United States--Spain Trade and Investment Analysis of Direct Investment Practices, Spanish and United States images: Origins and Reasons, Strengthening United States--Spanish Ties, the Role of Civil Society (Educational and Cultural exchanges), Intellectual Property and Internet in Spanish. 
The members of the Council agreed to undertake a challenging agenda short and long objectives, all intended to advance United States and Spanish relations. 
I would like to thank Vice President Al Gore, Spanish Deputy Prime Minister of the Economy and Finance, Mr. Rodrigo Rato, Spanish Minister of Foreign Affairs, Mr. Abel Matutes, and Stuart E. Eizenstat, US Under Secretary for Economic Business and Agricultural Affairs, and other distinguished presenters, for their meaningful participation in our meeting. 
I also take this opportunity to thank the two Executive Directors of our Council, Ambassador Diego Asencio and his Spanish counter part, Emilio Cassinello Auban. Ambassador Asencio and his Assistant, Elia Garcia-McComie did an outstanding job of bringing together all the ingredients essential to a productive meeting. 
It is important that my colleagues in the Senate and the people of the United States understand this special relationship, which is old in historical terms and yet new because it is being reinvigorated by this renewed attention to its importance. We must recognize that the United States with its growing Spanish speaking population, is a logical bridge between Latin America and Spain. We must take advantage of this moment in history to strengthen cultural and educational ties as well as promoting investment opportunities for both countries.

Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, these two bills will provide relief for two men who have fought with valor and honor for this country. H.R. 2731 and H.R. 2732 will provide justice for two Americans by correcting the date they became U.S. citizens. 
One of these men, John Andre Chalot, resides in my home State of Florida. Mr. Chalot, a retired postal worker living in Bradenton, FL, was born in Le Havre, France, on December 19, 1919. He immigrated to the United States with his parents in 1921. After being graduated from high school in 1939, he sought to enlist in the U.S. Army Air Corps. Because he was considered too young to fly in the corps he moved to Canada, joined the Royal Canadian Air Force [RCAF], and received his pilot wings. He flew Spitfires with the RCAF based in England from 1940 to 1943. While still in England, Mr. Chalot transferred to the U.S. Army Corps, 358th fighter Squadron, and received a commission as second lieutenant. At the time of his commission in 1943, Mr. Chalot had completed the naturalization process to become a U.S. citizen. Unfortunately, our Government misplaced Mr. Chalot's naturalization forms somewhere in the process. 
Early in 1944, while flying a routine P-51 mission over Germany, Mr. Chalot's plane was fired upon and hit, causing him to crash-land in Holland. With the help of the Resistance, Mr. Chalot managed to get to Paris, but in July 1944, he was betrayed by Gestapo agents and confined at Fresnes Prison. 
In August 1944, Germans crowded Mr. Chalot and 168 Allied airmen into boxcars and transported them to Buchenwald concentration camp. There they were confined in miserable, degrading, and inhumane conditions, forced to subsist on a starvation diet, and subjected to Nazi medical experiments. In November 1944, Mr. Chalot and most of his fellow airmen were transferred from Buchenwald to Luftstalag III, an infamous subcamp of Buchenwald, where they remained until their liberation at the end of the war. 
After the war, Mr. Chalot returned to the United States, and was finally naturalized as a U.S. citizen on September 18, 1945. 
On September 20, 1996, he applied to the Foreign Claims Settlement Commission for compensation pursuant to the Agreement Between the United States and Germany Concerning Final Benefits To Certain United States Nationals Who Were Victims of National Socialist Measures of Persecution. 
On September 5, 1997, the Commission denied Mr. Chalot's claim on the ground that he was not a U.S. citizen during his time as a Nazi prisoner of war and was, therefore, ineligible for compensation. H.R. 2731 would modify the date Mr. Chalot became a U.S. citizen and make him eligible for compensation under the Agreement Between the Federal Republic of Germany and the United States of America. 
The other bill, H.R. 2732, provides relief for Mr. Roy Desmond Moser, a Massachusetts resident with an almost identical situation. 
This legislation would make Mr. Chalot and Mr. Moser eligible for compensation by deeming them to be naturalized U.S. citizens as of the dates they began their military service. 
Mr. President, I believe that these two bills provide relief for two courageous men who fought for our Nation during World War II. I hope my colleagues understand the personal significance of these measures for these two individuals.

Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise for the purpose of introducing legislation which has been necessitated by a relatively arcane provision in the Social Security Act. That provision, Mr. President, is section 1903(d)3 which states that `the pro-rata share to which the United States is equitably entitled' as determined by the secretary--this would be the Secretary of HHS--`of the net amount recovered during any quarter by a State or any political subdivision thereof with respect to medical assistance furnished under the State plan shall be considered an overpayment to be adjusted under this subsection.' 
Under that provision, Mr. President, the Health Care Financing Administration has sent a letter to the States stating that they will now be responsible for providing to the Federal Government through an offset against their otherwise entitled funds under Medicaid, the health financing program for the poor, that portion of any recovery that they have made under a tobacco settlement that would be attributable to the Federal Government's share of previous payments for those Medicaid beneficiaries who had been deemed to have suffered a disease or illness related to tobacco. 
The letter states, Mr. President, that `under current law,' the law that I have just read, `tobacco settlement recoveries must be treated like any other Medicaid recoveries.' 
Mr. President, this is a situation which cries out for congressional attention. In the past, that section that I read had been interpreted to apply to those cases where there had been a billing error, where some Medicaid provider had overstated their reimbursement, the State had taken action to reduce that request for payment and had received funds from the provider that had been inappropriately paid in a previous account. This will be the first time that this section of the law is being used to really go to policy questions, and that is, what is the Federal Government's share of these tobacco settlements which have been negotiated by the States? 
I believe that the reasons that Congress should take action on this are several. First, this is a policy issue and should not be settled at a bureaucratic level, applying a statute that was written to deal with much different, much less policy-oriented issues as the question of the State and Federal share of State-initiated tobacco settlements. 
I will read, Mr. President, from a letter dated November 7 to the President and signed by nine of our Nation's Governors in which they state:  
The issue of control of the settlement funds will be difficult to resolve, and clearly a discussion of the distribution of hundreds of billions of dollars demands congressional involvement. Unfortunately, it appears that the Health Care Financing Administration is not prepared to wait for Congress to act. 
Then the letter goes on to recount the fact that on November 3 the Health Care Financing Administration contacted the State Medicaid directors to begin the process of collecting what it, the Health Care Financing Administration, perceives to be the Federal portion of settlement funds attributable to Medicaid. 
Second, the reality is that the Federal Government has known about these suits initiated by the States since their pendency. In the case of the State of Florida, that means approximately 4 years. But the Federal Government has been passive. It did not ask or respond to requests to be listed as a coplaintiff and therefore be actively involved in litigation. It has provided none of the financing of the litigation, which in some cases has amounted to tens of millions of dollars, and yet now after a successful recovery, it wants to insert itself through this provision, that was designed to deal with reimbursements of minor amounts, to collect major amounts under these tobacco settlements. 
Finally, the Federal Government is not restricted from initiating its own effort to collect what funds it thinks it is due from the tobacco settlements. If the Federal Government feels--whether it is Medicare; programs under CHAMPUS, the health care for military personnel and their dependents; the Veterans Administration; or any other program in which the Federal Government is paying all or a substantial portion of health care costs--if the Federal Government feels that it has a legitimate case for recovery, it ought to do the same thing that the States have done, and that is initiate direct action toward such a recovery. But it is unseemly for the Federal Government to now be coming in after the fact and trying to collect on the good efforts that the States have taken. 
I have met with representatives of the White House and will continue to meet to determine if it is felt that specific legislation might be required in order to give the Federal Government the potential to recover those funds that the national taxpayers have paid which they should not have paid because they were due to illnesses or disease occasioned by the use of tobacco. I suggest that the representatives of the White House look closely at State legislation such as that which was passed in Florida, upon which Florida's successful settlement was predicated. 
Mr. President, I will be sending to the desk legislation which will state that the provision that I cited and other provisions analogous to it shall not apply to any amount recovered or paid to a State as part of a settlement or judgment reached in litigation initiated or pursued by a State against one or more manufactures of tobacco products. This would clearly state that as a matter of congressional policy it was not our intention that that arcane accounting provision should be applied to a major policy issue such as the allocation of funds between the Federal Government and the States that were recovered as a result of State-initiated litigation against a tobacco company. 
Rather, that is an issue which should be resolved by the policymakers before the Federal Government; that is, the United States Congress, in appropriate consultation with the President. 
So, Mr. President, I send this legislation to the desk and ask for its immediate referral.

 Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, on Wednesday, November 5, the Asian Elephant Conservation Act passed the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee with unanimous support. I am hopeful that this important bill, introduced by Senator Jeffords, will ensure that the children of the world will not miss out on these extraordinary mammals. 
The Asian Elephant Conservation Act is constructed along the lines of the successful African Elephant Conservation Act. I have been heartened to learn that the African Elephant Act is producing positive results. I am hopeful that the Asian Elephant Conservation Act will likewise support research, conservation, anti-poaching education, and protection of the animals. I feel strongly, however, that no funds allocated by these Acts are spent to promote efforts to resume the ivory trade or to encourage trophy hunting. 
According to a 1996 nationwide poll, 84 percent of Americans support efforts to protect elephants, yet I have learned that some of the funds from the African Elephant Conservation Act have gone toward the promotion of elephant trophy hunting. There is ongoing debate about the success and appropriateness of US taxpayer dollars being used to support such activities, and I look forward to learning more about this troublesome issue in the coming months. 
For the time being, however, I wish to ask my colleagues for quick support and passage of the Asian Elephant Conservation Act. I am honored to be a co-sponsor of the bill, and look forward to finding more ways to protect and conserve endangered species, both in the United States and abroad.

Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to urge passage of a private bill that will honor a man that served this country with honor and bravery. This bill will allow Robert R. Ingram to receive the Medal of Honor for conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity at the risk to his life above and beyond the call of duty. 
Robert R. Ingram served as Corpsman with Company C, First Battalion, Seventh Marines in Vietnam. On March 28, 1966, Corpsman Ingram accompanied Marine point platoon as it dispatched an outpost of a North Vietnam Aggressor battalion in Quang Ngai Province, Republic of Vietnam. They were sabotaged by the Vietnamese, and the platoon was decimated, suffering numerous casualties. Corpsman Ingram was himself injured four times during the attack while he administered first aid to other members of his platoon. 
Enduring the pain from his many injuries and disregarding his own life, Corpsman Ingram's selfless actions saved many U.S. soldiers that day. By his indomitable fighting spirit, daring initiative, and unfaltering dedication to duty, Corpsman Ingram clearly earned the Medal of Honor as a result of his actions. However, the Navy failed to process an award, and Corpsman Ingram received no official commendation for his actions. The men with whom he served that fateful day, and the men whose lives he saved, all feel that a commendation is due. However, there is no evidence of an award recommendation. 
Mr. President, it is time that Robert R. Ingram receives an honor that should have been bestowed upon him over thirty years ago. This bill calls for the time limitations in Section 6248 to be waived so that this action may be taken.

Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I speak on behalf of the passage of the legislation which will soon be before us which will authorize the President to enter into negotiations on behalf of this Nation as it relates to trade and trade-related matters. 
Mr. President, we refer to this legislation as fast track. As with a number of other policy issues here in Washington, I consider these words to be nondescript. They do not convey what it is we are being asked to vote upon. 
This legislation first establishes a framework within which the President of the United States can conduct negotiations. In essence, it is analogous to a board of directors of an organization telling its executive that it can negotiate a particular contract but stipulating what the conditions of that contract must be and what the limits of the negotiating authority are. When that negotiation reaches a conclusion, and if that conclusion is a trade agreement, when that agreement is returned to the Congress where the Congress has a single `yes' or `no' vote but cannot modify the agreement, and in the case of the Senate surrender some of the prerogatives relative to extension of debate and other procedural advantages which are normally available to us as individual Members of the Senate, the question is, why will the Congress today be willing to do this? Why have Congresses over the past two or three decades been willing to pass such legislation and transfer a portion of their authority to the President? The answer is very simple. That is, if we do not do this, we don't have the opportunity to enter into trade negotiations because our trading partners will not come to the table. 
Why would countries like Great Britain, France, Argentina, and Japan not want to come to negotiate with the United States unless the President had this authority? Most of those countries have some form of a parliamentary form of government in which the executive branch and the legislative branch are effectively merged. Therefore, when the Prime Minister speaks on behalf of the Government of the United Kingdom, as an example, he or she is not only speaking as the head of the executive branch but speaking as the head of the legislative branch and as the head of the political coalition which controls the Government. So what the Prime Minister says at the negotiating table there is the political capability and expectation of his or her ability to deliver on behalf of the Government of the United Kingdom. 
In the case of the United States, we don't have this integration of the executive and the legislative branch, and frequently the President is not the head of a coalition that effectively controls Government. We have one of those examples today in which the President is of one political party, the leadership of the Congress is of another. So our trading partners would say, why should I sit down with the President to negotiate the best agreement that I can? And, like all agreements, trade agreements contain a heavy component of compromise. You gain some benefits in area A, and you give some benefits in area B in order to reach an agreement that both sides will feel is advantageous. 
Our trading partners would say, why would we agree to such a treaty knowing that then Congress is going to come back, and in area B where we got our principal benefits they will try to offer a series of amendments to strip us of those benefits? 
So the product that would finally emerge would not be one that both sides would feel is balanced and that can be supported. 
So, the reason that we have this process is because without it we never get to the question of whether we would have a negotiated agreement because the other parties would not sit with us to enter into that discussion. 
So, this is fundamentally a question of does the United States wish to negotiate trade agreements, or do we wish to sit in the stands while the other nations of the world negotiate trade agreements that will have an impact upon us? 
I know that this debate is heavily affected by history. Much of that history is a result of the North American Free-Trade Agreement and negative experiences that people have had under the North American Free-Trade Agreement. 
I come from a State that has felt that sting of the North American Free-Trade Agreement, particularly as it relates to agriculture. Our congressional delegation was very concerned about this in the days leading up to the final vote on the North American Free-Trade Agreement. We secured what we thought were some protective understandings from the administration. And I am sad to say that through a combination of inadequate enforcement and a failure to keep commitments we were very disappointed, and many sectors of our agricultural industry were adversely affected. Learning from this lesson--not what some have learned, which is we should wash our hands of this process and have nothing more to do with attempting to negotiate trade agreements, or to be involved when other people are negotiating trade agreements--the lesson that I and others have learned is this time we are going to put these concerns into writing in the legislation which sets the parameters for the negotiation and not depend upon promises of what will happen after the negotiation has been concluded. 
So, in this fast-track legislation as passed by the Senate Finance Committee there are a number of provisions that are intended to provide that enhanced level of confidence that agreements reached will be agreements enforced, that commitments made will be commitments realized. 
Let me just quote from page 8 of the Finance Committee's version of this legislation beginning on line 6:  
Agriculture: The principal negotiating objectives of the United States with respect to agriculture are in addition to those set forth in various sections of the Food Security Act of 1985 to achieve on an expedited basis to the maximum extent feasible more open and fair conditions of trade in agricultural commodities by . . . 
And then a series of specific points are mentioned. Let me refer to three of those specific points. 
Specific requirements for negotiators to account for the unique problems of perishable agricultural products, including disciplines on restrictive or trade distorting import and export practices; 
Two: Requirements to address market access for the United States agricultural products, including removing unjustified sanitary and phytosanitary restrictions; 
Three: Protection against unfair trade practices, including State subsidies, dumping, and export targeting practices. 
All of those, Mr. President, and more are listed in the fast-track legislation that is before us. 
In addition to that, in the report language submitted by the Senate Finance Committee, there is a requirement for the President to account for foreign unfair or trade distorting practices for specific sectors, particularly perishable agricultural products, citrus fruit, and fruit juices. 
So, we have learned some of the lessons of the recent past and are now applying those lessons in terms of the parameters of the 
negotiation in this fast-track agreement. 
Why do we need to be there in the first place? We had this experience in the recent past. Why not just step back, defend our position in America, and let the rest of the world take its place? 
I believe, Mr. President, that we are facing a stark choice; that is, a choice as to whether the United States is to maintain its leadership position in the world, to be at the table writing the rules of international trade so that those rules will take into consideration our circumstances, our expectations, and our economic interests. Or, are we to retreat from the world, and allow others to write the rules to their advantage? 
Mr. President, we represent only 4 percent of the customers of the world. Ninety-six percent of the people on this planet are not residents of the United States of America. We cannot maintain our growing economy and its standard of living unless we reach out to that 96 percent of our fellow human beings who do not live in our country. We cannot maintain our current record level of economic growth and expansion and prosperity and full employment without active trade. The United States has already opened its borders to foreign goods. We have recognized the benefit to our people of having access to goods and services that are produced outside the United States. We have done so most dramatically by reducing our tariffs to an average level of 2 percent. That is the average level of tariff on products coming into the United States. But our products going out of the United States trying to reach that 96 percent of mankind who are not U.S. residents face tariffs that exceed 10 percent on average. 
As an example, the country which is specifically mentioned in this legislation as being authorized for the President to negotiate membership in the North American Free-Trade Agreement is Chile. In February of last year, I visited Santiago. We learned from the United States-Chilean Chamber of Commerce that the average tariff against United States products in Chile is 11 percent. The average United States tariff against Chilean products is the 2 percent, which is the worldwide average. 
In a discussion with several businesses, some of which are United States, some of which are non-United States, as to what would be the effect of the United States entering into an agreement which would reduce Chilean tariffs against United States products, the answer was universally that it would lead to a substantial increase in the Chilean purchase of United States products. 
As an example, one firm that was in the boat building and boat repair business said that they bought their sheet steel and their machine tools from Europe because at the current level of tariffs Europe was more economically competitive, but that with a lowering of Chilean tariffs against United States products, the opening of a free trade relationship between the United States and Chile, they would shift their purchases of those products to the United States to the substantial benefit of our country. 
Chile is a relatively small country, a population of about 15 million. It is about the same size as my State of Florida. But it is a country which has had a dynamic market-driven economic growth over recent years. It has had a powerful influence on other developing countries in South America, and in the world. Establishing this relationship with Chile would be a strong United States recognition of the progress that this country has made, and an encouragement for others to follow Chile's example. 
Unfortunately, Mr. President, most of the debate about fast track has in fact focused on our own hemisphere, and specifically on the expansion of the North American Free-Trade Agreement. 
That is certainly an important part of this fast-track authority, but it may be secondary in its importance to the U.S. economy to a series of important sectoral negotiations which are going to commence under the GATT agreement to which we have already agreed. 
Under the GATT agreement beginning in the next few years, there will be a series of negotiations on specific economic sectors. I would like to focus on one of those sectors which will be the topic of negotiations in 1999. And that is agriculture. This is important to us because agriculture represents the area of trade in which the United States has the greatest surplus with the world. The largest area in which the United States has an advantage in terms of export over import is in agricultural products. 
What are we going to be trying to accomplish at the 1999 agricultural sectoral negotiations? Some of the objectives of the United States will include reducing foreign tariffs in consultation with the U.S. agricultural industry on fruits and vegetables. Today, for example, Japan imposes a tariff on oranges which is as high as 40 percent. Other countries have similarly high tariffs on citrus products and other processed fruits and vegetables. One of our principal negotiating objectives will be to drive down those barriers to U.S. agricultural products in important markets. 
Another objective will be to increase or eliminate tariff rate quotas. These are the limits on the amount of goods that the United States can export to a country before it faces high and often preventive levels of tariffs. We want to see those quota limits as high as possible or totally eliminated. This is another important objective of our negotiations. 
Mr. President, our distinguished chairman has asked to have the floor returned to him, and I shall do so by just summarizing to say that two other important agricultural objectives are to eliminate export subsidies and to eliminate state trading enterprises which have both distorted the agricultural market. If we do not pass this legislation, the United States will not be at the table in 1999. We will not have the opportunity to advance our goals. 
There are risks involved in extending to this President the same authority that we have granted to Presidents over the last two decades, but I believe the greater risk for the United States is to stand on the sidelines and let others write the rules that will determine our economic well-being. I believe the United States needs to be there. We need to be there with a sense of strength, pride, and confidence in our ability to negotiate an agreement. And if the President is found to have acted in a foolish way that is contrary to U.S. interests, we have the responsibility and the power to reject that agreement with a decisive `no' vote. 
Mr. President, I appreciate the leadership which our chairman has given on this matter. I know what a strong supporter he has been on the issues.

Mr. GRAHAM. Thank you, Mr. President. 
Mr. President, I am here to speak on two of the specific projects that are covered by this veto and now the proposal to override that veto, and then, second, I will make some remarks based on my own personal experience as to how the relationships between the legislative and the executive branches should function when the Executive has the line-item veto. 
First, let me turn to two projects with which I have extensive familiarity. 
First, a pier improvement project at the Mayport Naval Station near Jacksonville, FL. Mayport has been designated by the Navy to be the second Atlantic coast major naval facility, the first being Norfolk. In order to carry out this role, it has been determined by the Navy that it is necessary to make certain improvements to the piers that serve Mayport Naval Station. The improvements were included in the 5-year Navy plan. 
The Navy made another decision, and that was to utilize a design-build process as the means for constructing these pier improvements. In contrast to a traditional procedure in which a project is fully designed and then contractors bid on those completed designs, design-build merges the creative and the execution stages which one firm is responsible for submitting a bid to both design a project that will meet the needs of the client, in this case the Navy, and then to construct that project. It also has the benefits that the project can be segmented, so that if there are portions of the project that can proceed ahead on a more rapid pace because they are less complex or have less design requirements, they can be doing so. 
The result of this design-build process for the Navy has been both a significant savings in time and cost. 
A recent study by the Design-Build Institute of America states that over the last 4 years, naval facilities utilizing this design-build process have led to a timesaving of 15 percent over the conventional method of first design, then bid, then build, and a cost savings of 12 percent. That design-build process was determined to be appropriate to this pier improvement at Mayport. 
The significance of that, Mr. President, is that it runs in conflict with one of the criteria that the President used in determining which projects to veto, because one of those criteria was, was this project one which had been designed and, therefore, construction could commence in this fiscal year? In the case of a design-build project, you don't have a separate sequence of design. The design and the construction project are issued as one. 
In the case of Mayport, the Navy expectation is that they will issue their design-build contract in March of 1998. At this point, some of the real benefits of design-build begin to take effect. As an example, the toe wall of these particular piers will use a similar design to the toe wall of piers that are immediately adjacent, and, therefore, the expectation is that they will use the same designs which have already been done, therefore allowing the construction work on the toe wall to commence in June of 1998. 
Another important component of this pier improvement is to add a new electrical circuit so that the ships which have higher electrical demand today, because of all of their computerization and other electronics, will be adequately served. This electrical work represents a fifth circuit to the already existing four circuits. And so, again, no significant new design work will be required. It is expected that the electrical construction work will also commence in June of 1998. 
So the facts of this case are that, if the purpose of that standard, which was, is the design complete so construction can start? has been met, the only difference is because this is a design-build contract as opposed to a traditional contract, you can't answer the question, is there a completed set of designs here ready to be bid upon? It is ironic that the design-build process was specifically recognized and applauded in the reinvention-of-Government study that was done in 1993 as the wave of the future as to how the Federal Government should go about much of its construction activity. 
So, Mr. President, with that background on Mayport, I believe this clearly is one of those projects where the facts do not substantiate the reasoning that was given as the basis of the veto. We have an important project meeting a clear national defense need which the Navy has stated should be completed within the 5-year plan. The Navy has selected a design-build process which will result in construction commencing on important elements of this pier improvement in June of 1998. 
The second item which is of concern to me relates to Whiting Field, a major Navy aviation training center in Santa Rosa County, FL. Whiting Field is the centerpiece of actually a series of fields of runways and other training facilities that are located throughout northwest Florida and south Alabama. 
The Air Force and the Navy have decided on an eminently reasonable new joint project, and that is, that rather than having the basic training of naval aviators being done exclusively by the Navy and Air Force aviators being done exclusively by the Air Force, that they will develop joint training at the primary and advanced levels. Whiting Field has been designated as the field upon which approximately half of the primary training for both Air Force and Navy pilots will occur. 
A new aircraft has been selected, called JPATS, which will serve the needs of both the Navy and the Air Force. This new aircraft has some different requirements than the aircraft which the Navy has used for many years at Whiting Field. One of those is a slightly longer runway for safety purposes. It is a somewhat higher performance aircraft. 
In this legislation was $1.2 million to add to the length of one of the outlying fields which serves Whiting, which happens to be located in Brewton, AL. Also, as part of this $1.2 million, will be a safety zone built around one of these runways in order to enhance the safety for aviators with this new higher performance JPATS aircraft. Again, this is in the Navy's 5-year plan. The JPATS aircraft are going to be delivered in the year 2000. 
The work to be done is not high-tech, it is the extension of an existing runway, and, therefore, the development of complicated designs is not relevant to the project to be performed. Therefore, again, the rationale for the veto, which was that unless design had been conducted, assumedly construction could not start in the fiscal year and, therefore, the project became a candidate and, in fact, a victim of the President's veto. 
Just as the project at Mayport, this meets all the tests. In this case, the Navy and the Air Force have agreed that this is a needed project to secure an important new joint relationship between our two principal aviation services which will result in significant savings to the Nation and, hopefully, enhancements in the quality of training and the jointness of training of the Air Force and the Navy. 
I had the opportunity to visit Whiting Field in August of this year, and I can state from personal experience and discussions with the leadership of this important naval facility that there is great commitment to seeing that this joint training is a success and a contribution to the Nation's security. All this is going to have a key date of the year 2000 when the new aircraft begin to be delivered. 
So, Mr. President, I urge that these and the other projects that are contained in the legislation to override the President's veto be supported, because I believe they are the kind of projects which the Nation will need for its long-term national security. I commend the leadership of the Appropriations Committee and the Military Construction Subcommittee for their careful attention to these two projects. 
If I can take a brief period to comment about the line-item veto process. I was Governor of the State of Florida for 8 years with the line-item veto authority, and I utilized that authority where I thought appropriate. I believe that the most significant use of the line-item veto is in its deterrence effect. The fact that legislators who might be inclined to submit and seek passage of a project that did not have the positive qualities of Mayport and Whiting Field would be inclined to do so but for the fact that they knew the Executive could identify them as being inappropriate and, therefore, subject that sponsoring legislator to the public scrutiny of having advanced such a proposal. 
But I believe for that deterrence to be effective, there are some requirements on the side of the executive branch which were not met in this first test of the line-item veto at the Federal level. 
Two of those requirements are, first, no surprises. Neither of these projects are new to the Navy, to the Air Force, to the Office of Management and Budget, to the White House. These projects represent the completion of important previously determined military priorities: Mayport as the second naval port on the Atlantic coast; joint training of Air Force and naval aviators. 
Therefore, as these two projects moved through the appropriations process, there were plenty of opportunities, if it was felt that they were going to be subject to veto, to have sent up such a signal. No such signal was sent. 
The assumption was, since they had the support of the Department of Defense, and they were within the 5-year plan, that they were projects that had a time urgency, that they were appropriate. 
In the future, I would urge whoever is the Executive authority to be engaged in this process at a much earlier stage to indicate if there are some problems and what the nature of those concerns will be. As the chairman has indicated, apparently even he did not know what the criteria were to be for these projects until after the Congress had passed the final bill and sent it to the White House for its consideration. 
And the second is that after the bill has gone to the White House, and they are looking at these items, if they see an item that they believe is a candidate for veto, they owe it to themselves, they owe it to the sponsoring individuals and agencies, and they owe it to the national objectives which are sought to be achieved to have a frank discussion with the parties who are most knowledgeable so that they can get the facts. 
I made an effort on both of these projects to educate who I thought were the appropriate people. Obviously, my attempt at education was not successful. But I am confident that had there been a full opportunity to review the facts that I have briefly submitted here this afternoon, that the White House would have made a different decision relative to these two projects. 
So I think, second, that the White House needs to have the practice to bring into the process before the final decision those who are most knowledgeable so that never again will it have to issue statements that: `I'm sorry I did this. And I did it out of ignorance.' Ignorance declared is a sign of a person who is ready to enter into confession and redemption, but this process is too important to have very many confessions and redemptions. We ought to try to be operating based on facts and knowledge and the importance to the national security of these significant defense items. 
So, Mr. President, with those comments on these two specific projects, and a little unsolicited advice to the White House, I urge a strong Senate vote in favor of this proposal. 
I hope that our colleagues in the House will follow suit and the President will see the wisdom of the line-item veto process in its full extension of a dynamic relationship between two equal branches of the U.S. Government. Thank you.  
Mr. BURNS addressed the Chair.

 Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to express my support as an original sponsor of legislation to restore the tax exemption for the Teacher's Insurance Annuity Association and College Retirement Equities Fund's (TIAA-CREF) pension business. 
Hidden in the depths of the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997, a provision was included to strip TIAA-CREF of its original tax status. Repealing TIAA-CREF's tax exemption, which extended back almost 80 years, clearly conflicted with other provisions in the bill that recognize the need to encourage both education and retirement savings. TIAA-CREF supports nearly 2 million participants and over 6,000 educational and research institutions and has historically served as a model of pension portability and coverage. 
In the teaching profession, pension portability is particularly vital. To the benefit of students, policy makers and the general public, pension portability under TIAA-CREF allows professors and educators to share their expertise at multiple institutions without losing their retirement security. TIAA-CREF's market share is limited by its charter to colleges, universities, independent schools and other non-profit educational and research organizations. 
In July, during debate on the Taxpayer Relief Act, 43 of my colleagues in the Senate joined me in sending a letter to tax negotiators urging them to reject this direct assault against America's educators. I look forward to working with my colleagues in the months ahead to restore TIAA-CREF's original tax status.

 Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to commend the meritorious efforts of Edward Villella, founder of the Miami City Ballet, in the global dance community. 
Mr. Villella's interest in dance began when he joined the School of American Ballet, where he now serves on the board of directors, at the age of 10. 
Early in his career, Edward Villella was the first American male to perform with the Royal Danish Ballet and was the only American asked to dance an encore at the Bolshoi Theater in Moscow. 
Villella has honored America with his contributions to dance and his dedication to teaching dance to others. He danced for President John Kennedy's inaugural and in 1975 captured an Emmy for his television production of `Harlequin.' 
Recently, he was 1 of the 11 recipients of the National Medal of Arts and was inducted into the Florida Artists Hall of Fame this year, the most prestigious cultural honor that can be bestowed upon an individual in Florida. 
Edward Villella has honored his State by being awarded a distinguished Kennedy Center Honor for lifetime achievement. 
Mr. President, on behalf of Floridians everywhere, I applaud Edward Villella for his success. It is my earnest hope that his outstanding contributions to our State will continue to inspire us for years to come.

Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, today I am submitting a resolution, together with my friend and colleague Senator Lugar, which expresses the sense of the Senate that the United States should give high priority to working with our partners in the Americas to address shared foreign policy and security problems in the Western Hemisphere. 
Over the past several years we have witnessed unprecedented progress in our hemisphere. This sweeping wave of democratization and free market economics now provides us with a unique opportunity to consolidate these gains and to create a new security regime in the Americas. This new regime must be based upon the premise that we will work with our neighbors as equal partners to address security-related matters of mutual concern. 
On August 1, 1997, the President revised the unilateral policy prohibiting the sale or transfer of advanced weapons systems to countries of South America, Central America, and the Caribbean, and restored the policy based on a case-by-case analysis comparable to that used in other regions of the world. This alone is not a security policy. It is an action that must be wrapped in a broader security policy for the region. This resolution urges the President to work towards such a broader policy and provides some direction for that policy. 
We must recognize the great progress that the democratically elected civilian governments of the region have made. For this they deserve to be treated as we treat our other democratic friends and allies. At the same time, we must work with them to find ways to enhance security through defense cooperation, transparency, and confidence and security building measures. We urge the President to emphasize these themes in his meetings with our hemisphere partners. 
 Mr. President, I urge all of our colleagues to join Senator Lugar and myself in supporting this resolution. It will provide the President with the support of the Congress as he pursues these objectives, and demonstrate to our partners that we remain committed to building a secure environment so that all nations of the hemisphere can prosper in peace.

Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, today, I stand before you to highlight an injustice which has been done to the men and women who have served this country with selfless dedication. They have devoted themselves to the mission of protecting our country while promoting peace and democracy around the world. For this contribution to our country, we reward their performance with a retirement package which includes health care. Unfortunately, through a series of independent laws, we have created a disjointed health care benefits package which treats retirees differently depending on their age and where they happen to live. 
I am introducing a bill to correct this disjointed health care policy. There is clearly a double standard affecting our veterans. Under the current provisions of the law, military retirees are eligible to receive health care under the CHAMPUS program until they become 65 years old. After that time, their health care is provided by Medicare. Under the CHAMPUS program, retirees have access to a program known as the mail-order pharmacy program which allows military members and retirees to obtain prescription drugs through the mail. Retirees over the age of 65 years old cannot be supported through the CHAMPUS program under current legislative restrictions. Medicare has no such pharmacy benefit. This means that once retirees become 65 years old, they lose the benefit and convenience of a mail-order pharmacy program. This comes at a time in their lives when they are more likely to need prescription drugs. 
I commend the Department of Defense on their initiative to develop the mail-order pharmacy program. This new program was established to provide better service to the military community and to enable them to maximize that level of service within their decreasing available resources. 
Military retirees and their dependents are eligible to receive free medical care from military installations on a space available basis. However, as the military continues to downsize their medical corps, `space available' is becoming more and more elusive for retirees. Pharmacy services are likewise available to retirees at military installations on a space available basis. For those retirees who were receiving their medical care, including prescription services, from a military installation which was closed by Base Realignment and Closure [BRAC] decisions, we have made an exception to the law which allows these retirees to participate in the mail-order pharmacy program. We have created a conglomeration of rules which apply to military retirees depending on their personal circumstances. 
My proposal is very simple. All military retirees, including their dependents, should have access to the same health care benefits. We should not differentiate between medical benefits based only on a retiree's age or where a retiree happens to live. All retirees should be allowed to use the mail-order pharmacy program. 
The General Accounting Office estimates that this proposal will cost approximately $229 million. While I remain committed to reducing the budget deficit and maintaining a balanced budget, I feel that the current legislation has created an inequity in the retirement benefits provided to our military personnel which must be corrected. It is the right thing to do. 
This Nation owes a debt of gratitude to our military retirees. They have endured many hardships during their careers, including separation from their families for extended periods of time and frequent moves to all corners of the globe. They have also risked their lives in the name of freedom and democracy. 
Military retirees have given tirelessly of themselves throughout their careers, and this proposal is an opportunity to correct an unjust situation.

 Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, as more and more Americans live to be 100, thanks to advances in health and longevity, I am honored to offer a tribute to a distinguished centurion from Florida: Mr. Fred Hooper of Ocala, FL. 
Mr. Hooper, who celebrates his 100th birthday on October 6, 1997, is a builder, an educator, and an inspiration to all those who have aspired to the triumph of victory in sports competition. Fred Hooper has a special place in the history of horse racing because he won the Kentucky Derby in 1945 with his first horse, `Hoop Jr.', bought in 1943. Since then, he has bred and raced more than 100 stakes winners. 
For decades, Mr. Hooper has been an instrumental force in thoroughbred racing. Through his promotion of horse racing, he has supported and strengthened Florida tourism and agriculture; two industries which are important components of Florida's economy. 
As he approaches the special milestone of his 100th birthday, Mr. Hooper continues to rise early in the morning to oversee the training of his top thoroughbreds and the cutting and baling of his hay in the fields at his farm. 
I recently visited this living legend at his home in Ocala. As he recalled his accomplishments and his ties that extend throughout America, I was inspired by a man who has lived a full life and has impacted so many people and events. He told me of his first horse, `Hoop Jr.', and his working relationship with Eddie Arcaro, one of the all-time greatest jockeys. Together they achieved racing history with their victory at the 1945 Kentucky Derby. This Hooper-Arcaro combination advanced the Florida racing industry to national prominence, while making Fred Hooper a legend in Florida and the racing world. 
I also learned that Mr. Hooper's activities have not been limited to racing. The Hooper Construction Company built roads, bridges, airports, dams and buildings in Florida and the Southeast. It has been said that if all the roads built by Mr. Hooper's company were linked together, the combined total would stretch for four lanes from Miami to Houston. 
Education is another Fred Hooper hallmark. During the 1970's, he contributed to the building of a private school in Alabama, on the former site of his construction company. And, he is rightfully proud of his support--and the generosity of the thoroughbred industry--for the veterinary school at the University of Florida. 
Part of the joy of this birthday is sharing the celebration with family. Mr. Hooper is the proud father of 4 children, 13 grandchildren and 9 great-grandchildren. 
The celebration of his centennial birthday on October 6, 1997, will be another achievement in the rich and rewarding life of Fred Hooper. I ask my colleagues to join me, the community of Ocala, the Hooper family and all those who love horse racing in congratulating Fred Hooper and extending to him best wishes into the next century.

Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, today I join my colleague Senator D'Amato as we introduce legislation to increase the amount of low income housing tax credits allocated to the States and to index the low-income housing credit for inflation. 
In a time of fiscal austerity, housing credits encourage private investment in economically sound, privately owned, affordable homes for low-income working families in all 50 States. By helping families that get up and go to work every day to earn their rent and mortgage payments, the low-income housing credit provides families with an important stake in maintaining self-sufficiency. 
Mr. President, the low-income housing tax credit was created in the 1986 tax reform bill in the wake of decreasing appropriations for federally-assisted housing and the elimination of other tax incentives for rental housing production. The housing credit encourages the construction and renovation of low-income housing by reducing the tax liability placed on the developers of affordable homes. The credit is based on the costs of development as well as the percentage of units devoted to low-income families or individuals. 
The current formula used in determining a State's housing credit allocation is $1.25 multiplied by the State's population. Unlike other provisions in the Tax Code, this formula has not been adjusted since the credit was created in 1986. During the same period, inflation has eroded the credit's purchasing power by nearly 45 percent, as measured by the Consumer Price Index. 
The bipartisan bill Senator D'Amato and I introduce today proposes to increase the annual limitation on State authority to allocate low income housing tax credits to $1.75 per capita and index the cap for inflation. By freeing the 10-year-old cap on housing credits from its current limitation, as requested by the Nation's Governors, our bill will liberate States' capacity to help millions of Americans who still have no decent, safe, affordable place to live. 
A brief look at the history of the housing credit provides ample evidence of why our legislation is needed. In the State of Florida, for example, the LIHTC has used more than $187 million in tax credits to produce approximately 42,000 affordable, rental units, valued at over $2.2 billion. Tax credit dollars are leveraged at an average of $18 to $1. Nevertheless, in 1996, nationwide demand for the housing credit greatly out paced supply by a ratio of nearly 3 to 1. In Florida, credits are distributed based upon a competitive application process and many worthwhile projects are denied due to a lack of tax credit authority. 
This spring, the U.S. General Accounting Office [GAO], Congress' main investigative agency, released a national audit of the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit Program. The GAO found that the average housing credit apartment renter earns only 37 percent of the local area median income. Further, surveyed properties--more than 450--appeared to be in good condition and well-maintained. Additionally, the GAO reported that housing credit properties `overwhelmingly comply with statutory and regulatory requirements.' 
Mr. President, I'd like to draw attention to one example of how the low-income housing tax credit has benefited American families. I am referring to the Holly Cove housing community developed by Vestcor Equities near Jacksonville, FL. Vestcor provides clean, safe and affordable living environments for low- to moderate-income residents by developing, renovating, and operating multifamily communities. 
In addition to affordable housing, Vestcor, through developments such as Holly Cove provides community services to improve the quality of life of their residents. Through counseling, education, and resident involvement, Vestcor energizes its community and provides residents with the tools they need for success. Activities and educational programs offered include: budgeting and credit counseling, resume writing assistance, GED classes, substance abuse counseling, and after school homework assistance. In short, with the help of the low-income housing tax credit, Vestcor Equities strengthens the community by investing in children and families. 
Vestcor Equities provides first-hand evidence of the important role the low-income housing tax credit offers as a catalyst of private sector investment in our communities. 
Mr. President, as we struggle to balance the budget and restore fiscal responsibility in Washington, the housing credit allows bureaucrats to step aside and let the free market fill an important need in America's communities. I hope my colleagues will embrace this important legislation.

Mr. President, this is an extremely important and urgent bill, because the continuation of the 1996 law, with what I will describe as its inadvertent retroactive application to this class of people, is causing great distress and unnecessary instability in communities that are principally affected. As those who participated in the press conference earlier today underscored, this is a group of people who came here largely at our request. They came here because communism had taken over their country. They came here because the Soviet Union was establishing a satellite state in our own hemisphere. They came here in order to participate in those ultimately successful efforts to establish a democratic government in Nicaragua. 
Now for us to change the rules from those that were in place at the time we extended that invitation, to have the practical effect of denying these people even the opportunity to be heard on their request for a permanent residence in the United States, is outrageous and inconsistent with basic American principles. 
I underscore what Senator Mack and I have said throughout this debate. This is not an amnesty provision. By the passage of this legislation, no one automatically has their status in the United States altered. What they do have is the right to use the rules that were in effect when they came to this country to apply for permanent legal status in the United States. I think that is just fair and consistent with the relationships that we want to establish with, particularly, our neighbors in this hemisphere. 
Mr. President, I applaud my colleague for having asked for this tabling motion which, obviously, is not a motion in which he is going to urge success, but it is our means of getting an expression of opinion by the U.S. Senate on this fundamental issue. I urge defeat of the motion to table and then a quick adoption of this amendment. Thank you, Mr. President. 
Mr. DeWINE addressed the Chair.

Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I appreciate the chance to record my comments regarding the conference report on the Treasury-Postal appropriations bill. 
This legislation will help fund national functions, such as law enforcement and delivery of the mail. The law-enforcement provisions include an important anticrime initiative for Florida, which is strongly supported by public-safety officials. The anticrime provision would fund the establishment of a high intensity drug trafficking area in central Florida. 
I have worked closely with colleagues Senator Connie Mack and Congressman John Mica of Florida to include this measure in the conference report. 
In an effort to fight crime and to support law enforcement, I voted for the conference report for the appropriations for the Treasury Department, the U.S. Postal Service, the Executive Office of the President, and certain independent agencies for the fiscal year ending September 30, 1998. 
This conference report also contains a provision to adjust congressional pay for cost of living. When the Senate considered its version of this appropriations bill, the legislation did not include a pay adjustment for Members of Congress. The record reflects that I support the Senate version of this legislation that was submitted to a House-Senate conference. 
If I had the opportunity to vote on the proposed adjustment as a separate, stand-alone measure, I would have voted `no.'

 Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I want to take this opportunity to recognize a program that for the past 40 years has served over 30,000 troubled boys, girls, and their families. This program has assisted these troubled youth by providing an opportunity to learn to resolve conflicts and learn proper values as they work toward a lawful, productive, and secure future. I speak specifically of the Florida Sheriffs Youth Ranches, which have been in continuous operation since October 2, 1957. 
The first of these ranches was established on the banks of Florida's historic Suwannee River under the direction of the Florida Sheriffs Association. 
For four decades, this ranch and the many others established in its wake have provided a home for neglected, troubled, and abused boys and girls. They offer in-home counseling and parent effectiveness training to hundreds of families throughout Florida each year. The programs for youth include residential care, camping, foster care, adoption, after-care, and individual and family counseling. 
Through these youth ranches, the Florida Sheriffs Association and our State's individual sheriffs, deputies, and office staffs have made a vital contribution in the fight against juvenile delinquency and the breakdown of the American family. 
Mr. President, the Florida Sheriffs Youth Ranches are a shining example of law enforcement working with communities to help troubled youth and their families. I offer my sincerest congratulations and thanks for their four decades of service to the people of Florida, and wish all of the individuals involved the best of luck for the next 40 years and beyond.

Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I am very proud to support my friend and colleague, Senator Mack, in our efforts to include the Immigration Reform and Transition Act, as modified, in this current legislation. It is important that we take this step today, or as soon thereafter as possible. There are thousands of families who are currently in a legal limbo because of the retroactive changes that were made in the immigration laws that were passed in 1996. Senator Mack, Senator Kennedy, and others have worked to develop a bipartisan, humane solution to give these families the opportunity to remain together--and I underscore the word `opportunity'--and to continue the lives that they have built in hundreds of our local communities in the United States. 
I can tell you from personal knowledge and experience and relationships, that the people to whom this amendment is primarily directed are, in the overwhelming number, hard-working, tax-paying, law-abiding individuals who have followed every rule and regulation since they have been resident in the United States and are making a contribution to the development of our country. Since the 1996 retroactive immigration bill passed, with the consequences that Senator Mack has just outlined, these families have lived in fear, fear of being uprooted and torn apart, and fear that all of their hard work in the United States will be for naught. We now have the chance to act and ease these fears.

Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I am working today to offer fairness and justice for a woman who lives in Miami. She is 86 years old. She and her family came to America, encouraged by the U.S. Government to do so in 1984. Without this amendment, she faces almost certain deportation back to Nicaragua. With this amendment she has the chance, the opportunity to apply to be considered on her own individual merits, based on her length of residence in the United States and her contributions since she has been in this country, to stay in the United States on a permanent, secure basis. 
I also speak on behalf of an 18-year-old student at Coral Park High School in Miami. This student's parents fled Nicaragua when he was 7 years old. His family was allowed to stay under the old law, and now he may be forced back to a country with which he has almost no connection. 
These two examples, an elderly lady and a young man, are examples of the people to whom we are attempting to apply fundamental fairness, to give them the opportunity to apply on their own merits, on their own records in this country, for a legal, permanent status. These families have been in our Nation since the early 1980's, since our Government encouraged them to flee Communist oppression and civil unrest in Central America. Speaking specifically to those who have come from Nicaragua, they fled a nation which had been taken over by a Communist regime, which was supported by the then-Soviet Union. In one of the last of those cold war confrontations in a third country, between the Soviet Union and the United States, the United States encouraged those Nicaraguans to leave, to come and to participate in the effort, which was finally successful, to restore democratic government to Nicaragua. 
Mr. President, 15 years after they came at our request, they own their own homes, they have U.S. citizen children, they have opened up small businesses, they have become flourishing entrepreneurs. Now we have changed the rules and threaten to divide families. This massive upheaval would be detrimental, not only to the individuals affected, but also to Central American nations that would be forced to absorb thousands of new residents. This action, taken in 1996, if not modified by this amendment which Senator Mack, Senator Kennedy, and I are proposing today, would have adverse effects on U.S. interests in this important region. It would have a destabilizing effect today. It would have an even greater impact in the future, when, God forbid, we were ever in another situation as we were in Nicaragua in the early 1980's. How could the United States with any credibility call out to the people of that country to resist the actions of governments which were antithetical to U.S. interests? 
I believe the honor of the United States of America is at stake in this amendment that we offer today. I emphasize, as Senator Mack has so effectively done, that this is not an amnesty program. We are not stating that all of these people who meet the standards covered by this amendment will become permanent residents, or have any other legal status in the United States. What we are saying is that under the rules that applied at the time they came into this country, at our invitation, they will have the right to apply. They will have the right to apply to receive permanent residence. It will then be their obligation to meet the standards to justify a permanent status in the United States. That is fundamental American fairness. 
By adopting this amendment and by recommitting ourselves to that standard of fairness and justice, we will be sending a strong message, that we will support the foreign policy objectives that led to our call in the first instance. We will be sending a strong message that the United States of America believes in playing by the rules and not changing those rules in midlife. 
These families deserve that message of fairness. They deserve it now. They fled persecution and communism to seek a safe haven in our country. They assisted our country in restoring democracy to their country. 
We must not abandon them now. 
Mr. President, I yield back my time to my colleague, Senator Mack, and also to Senator Abraham, for further comments on this issue. Thank you, Mr. President.  
Mr. ABRAHAM addressed the Chair.

 Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, this month the people of Florida join with faculty, staff, students, and more than 70,000 alumni in honoring Florida International University on its 25th anniversary. For the past quarter century, this outstanding institution's commitment to academic excellence and its constant celebration of diversity has enriched communities throughout Florida, the United States, and the entire world. 
This milestone anniversary is particularly special to members of the Graham family. In 1943, State senator Ernest R. Graham--my father--introduced legislation to establish a public university in south Florida. Twenty-two years later, on May 26, 1965, the Florida State senate unanimously passed legislation to fulfill his vision. On September 19, 1972, Florida International University opened its doors for the first time. 
That would have been a proud day for my father. When I was growing up in the Miami area, he used to tell my brothers, sister, and I that the best investment he ever made were his Dade County school taxes. He was proud, even enthusiastic, about paying those taxes because they enabled his children to get a strong education in the Dade County public school system. If he were alive today, my father would agree that the time and energy he put into laying the groundwork for a Florida International University was yet another wise educational investment. 
After only a quarter-century in existence, FIU has already gained acclaim as one of the most academically challenging and culturally diverse universities in the entire United States. This distinction is a credit to Florida International University's hard-working staff, dedicated faculty, bright student body, loyal alumni, and especially the wise, dynamic leadership of FIU's four presidents--Charles Perry, Harold Crosby, Gregory Wolfe, and Modesto Maidique. 
Each of these four outstanding individuals have contributed to Florida International University's popularity, prestige, and reputation. When Charles Perry took the reins of FIU in 1969, a full 3 years before the university opened, the campus was a run-down airport tower, old empty hangars, and 342 acres of land in west Dade County. His boundless energy and zeal for establishing an outstanding public university in south Florida led to the largest opening day enrollment of any university in American history. On September 19, 1972, nearly 6,000 students started classes at Florida International University. 
Presidents Harold Crosby and Gregory Wolfe continued the outstanding work that president Perry had begun. President Crosby placed special emphasis on fulfilling the international vision espoused by FIU's founders, hiring faculty members from a number of foreign countries and establishing the multilingual, multicultural center. President Wolfe led Florida International through its critical transition from 2- to 4-year university. 
For the last 10 years, Florida International University has had the good fortune to be guided by a dedicated, hard-working leader with an eye for excellence, a passion for education, a keen insight into bringing town and gown together in support of academic success, and a determination to make FIU second to none in preparing students for the United States' future in an increasingly international economy and society. 
It might have been destiny that brought President Modesto `Mitch' Maidique to Florida International University. He has helped to mold FIU in his own image--president Maidique's own background contains the same ethnic and cultural diversity, financial savvy, and academic excellence that have come to characterize south Florida's preeminent public university. 
The son of German-Czech emigrants who settled in Cuba during the early 1800's, president Maidique was born in Havana in 1940. At the end of his formal education, he had earned three degrees from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology--bachelor of science, master of science, doctor of electrical engineering--and another from the business program at MIT's Cambridge neighbor, Harvard University. By the time he assumed Florida International University's presidency in 1986, he had added professor and distinguished businessman to his resume, teaching at prestigious institutions like Harvard and Stanford and lending his scientific knowledge and business know-how to several prominent firms. 
Success followed president Maidique to Florida International. His decade of leadership has spurred a number of impressive academic, financial, and cultural achievements. In academics, U.S. News & World Report consistently ranks Florida International University as one of the top 150 national universities in the United States. Money magazine says that it is among America's best public commuter universities. 
Perhaps Florida International University's greatest academic achievement is the fact that it so earnestly works to provide an outstanding education to all students, regardless of socioeconomic background. Thanks in part to low tuition rates, and to the work ethic and frugality of FIU administrators, faculty, and staff, its students are the fifth least indebted in the Nation. U.S. News & World Report rates it as one of the 10 best educational buys in the United States. 
Finally, Florida International University is one of the most diverse colleges in the United States that is increasingly benefited by its ethnic diversity. For the last 25 years, it has been training young adults to live, work, and succeed in a world that speaks multiple languages and celebrates a variety of cultural achievements. More than half of its student body is Hispanic, and the university produces more Hispanic graduates than any other university in America. All in all, it has 70,000 alumni that represent all 50 States and more than 146 countries. 
Mr. President, I join with all Floridians in congratulating president Modesto Maidique and every past and present member of the Florida International University community on its historic 25th anniversary. As the university prepares to begin its next quarter-century, its abiding commitment to academic excellence, affordability, and diversity is leading the United States into the 21st century.

Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, we would like to engage our dear friend, Senator Gorton, in a colloquy. He has once again drafted a difficult bill this year and has balanced difficult priorities. Within the energy conservation section of the bill, the committee has provided $500,000 more than in fiscal year 1997 for electrochromic research within the building equipment and materials section. We would hope that it is the expectation of the chairman that this $500,000 increase will be used to further the development of Plasma Enhanced Chemical Vapor Deposition [PECVD] techniques for electrochromic technology.

Mr. GRAHAM. I join my colleague from Florida in thanking the chairman for his hard work on behalf of the Everglades. As my friend from Washington is aware, the Federal Government--under an agreement enshrined in the Everglades Forever Act of the State of Florida--is committed to purchase land for Stormwater Treatment Area 1--East. This land will be used to create a buffer marsh bordering on the Everglades agricultural area to help restore water quality. As I understand it, nothing in the bill before us today prevents the Secretary from using a portion of the Everglades National Park land acquisition funding to assist in STA-1E land acquisitions.

Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I am very pleased to be able to join my good friend and colleagues, Senator Baucus and Senator Warner, in discussing the legislation that was introduced or will be introduced today, and was presented yesterday, the Intermodal Transportation Act. 
Mr. President, I will discuss some of the substantive provisions of this which have caused me to give it enthusiastic support, but I would like to comment in a preliminary manner about the way in which this legislation was developed. 
In a sense, this legislation has been in the course of development since we adopted the current Highway Transportation Act in 1991. It has been a course of development both by those who had high expectations and those such as myself who had apprehensions about the 1991 enactment and have been monitoring it closely to see what lessons we might learn from that experience to apply to now the next 6-year reauthorization of this important national legislation. 
This close scrutiny has particularly drawn the attention of those who have responsibility for the management of our highway systems at the State and local level, and it is appropriate that it should have that close scrutiny. Most of the responsibility for the construction, the management, the operation of our highway and bridge system is at the State and local level. Those officials represent a unique source of insight and wisdom as to what our national policy should be, and those resources of wisdom and insight have been applied in the development of the legislation that today is being introduced. 
I will also comment about the bipartisan spirit in which this has been developed. Senator Warner spoke about the many months in which we worked together in attempting to develop some principles that would be sound for America and would represent a fair and balanced program for each of the States of America. The fact that we are at the point of introducing this legislation, with almost every region of the country, almost every difference in the country from States that are mature, States that are rapidly growing, States that have peculiar climactic considerations that impact their highway system, large States, small States, States from every corner of the geography of America, Members of the U.S. Senate representing those States have now come together behind this legislation. That is in the best spirit of a democracy, seeking consensus behind a plan which will then have the confidence and support of the American people. 
I want to particularly commend Senator Warner, Senator Baucus, and Senator Chafee for their leadership on the Environment and Public Works Committee for taking all the principle, ideas, and suggestions and now putting them in the form of this legislation with strong bipartisan support. 
Let me talk briefly, Mr. President, about some of the reasons I am supporting this legislation. First, I am doing it as a strong supporter of a balanced budget. It would be easy to have a highway bill which would satisfy everyone's needs if there was an unlimited amount of money to be spent in that area of national responsibility. The fact is, there is not an unlimited amount of money to be spent in that area or in any other of our national responsibilities. We have committed ourselves to a policy of fiscal prudence, and to balance the Nation's budget by the year 2002. It would be the height of irresponsibility, within less than 2 months of having congratulated ourselves on having passed a balanced budget agreement, to then bust that agreement by presenting a highway bill which was substantially beyond the limits that had been prescribed in the balanced budget as our Nation's allocation for highway and bridge construction. I am pleased that this legislation complies with the balanced budget agreement. 
Second, I am pleased that this legislation will bring fundamental fairness and integrity to the allocation of our national resources for surface transportation among the 50 States and among the communities of America. 
We have had a system in the past which has utilized a number of factors that were increasingly irrelevant and frequently outdated in terms of their ability to determine relative need among the States in terms of highway and bridge construction. As an example, the current legislation that we are using in 1997 has the factor of census--where are the American people--and one of the considerations as to where the American people's transportation dollars should be allocated among the 50 States in order to best meet national needs. 
The difficulty is that the census that is used in that formula is the 1980 census, 17 years out of date. For a rapidly growing State like mine, that is a punishing provision. For some States, where the population has been stable or even declining over that 17-year period, it creates an unwarranted bonus. 
One of the principles of this bill in terms of fairness is that a key central indicator of highway need is the amount of highway transactions collected within that State for Federal purposes. All motorists across this land pay the same number of pennies per gallon of motor fuel purchased for Federal highway purposes. Therefore, there is a relationship between how much individual States collect for that Federal highway motor fuel tax and what the relative demand on the system is. People buy gasoline and other motor fuels because they will drive their vehicles. They tend to drive the vehicles relatively close to the point of purchase of that motor fuel. So, assessing how much tax is collected is a very strong indicator of where the need for the transportation services resides. 
So this bill essentially says that 90 cents of every dollar will be returned to the State at the point of collection. If a particular State collects $100 million a year of Federal motor fuel tax, it can be assured it will get back at least $90 million to meet the needs that were generated by those persons who purchased their motor fuel and paid that Federal tax. This is a very significant departure from our previous surface transportation acts. 
To put this in the context of my State of Florida, a large, fast-growing State, since 1991 we have averaged receiving not 90 cents, but less than 78 cents per year of our Federal motor fuels tax. That has resulted in an average per year return to our State of $768 million. When this legislation goes into effect for the next 6 years at a somewhat higher annual level of return, because as the country grows and as the economy expands more motor fuel is purchased, therefore, more taxes are paid, but primarily because we will be moving from 78 cents to 90 cents of every dollar returned, our State is projected for the next 6 years to receive an average of $1 billion a year in Federal highway funds. That will allow my fast-growing State and its 15 million residents to be able to much better meet the needs of maintaining the system that is in existence and expanding the system in order to meet the demands of a growing population and an expanding economy. 
Third, Mr. President, this legislation balances national needs and State and local needs. Some would argue, and I think with considerable persuasion, that what we ought to do is to have the National Government substantially back away from a Federal highway program, repeal substantial amounts of the Federal motor fuel tax and let the States make a determination as to whether they want to pick up that tax and levy it now as a State tax and use those funds directly for State purposes. 
Frankly, moving toward the 90 cents on the dollar program to assure fundamental fairness is a major step toward that type of a turnback philosophy. But this legislation continues to recognize that there is an important national role in transportation. If I want to drive my car from Miami Lakes, FL, to the home State of our Presiding Officer, I have to drive through many States. It is, therefore, important to me that each one of those States has a safe and efficient highway system to allow me to achieve my destination of mobility from one part of America to another. 
That is a national need for which we all have an interest and a responsibility. I believe that this legislation balances those two desires to place as much responsibility and freedom of action and determination of priorities at the State and local level out of a belief that it is there that there is the best ability to assess what the real needs are, while still maintaining a sufficient national role to assure that we have national mobility across this great continent. I believe that the legislation that we introduce today strikes that appropriate balance. 
A fourth aspect of this legislation is simplification and streamlining. As Senator Warner discussed, this legislation will reduce the number of categories in which the Federal Government provides highway and bridge funds to the States and local communities. It will make it easier for the public, easier for people in our communities and States, easier for us here in the Congress to understand the system, because it will be more simplified. We will get greater efficiency out of the funds derived. There should be lessened administrative costs because there will be fewer programs to maintain and monitor. Increasing the ability of people in our communities and in our States to make their transportation decisions should be and is a key priority of this legislation. 
Mr. President, I close by discussing a final point, which is a point at which I suggest that we need to be totally candid with the American people. I voted against ISTEA in 1991 and stated that one of my reasons for voting against it was the fact that in all probability, at the end of the 6-year period of that legislation, our roads and bridges would be in worse shape than they were in 1991. I am sad to report that the U.S. Department of Transportation has issued reports which indicate that my prophecy was correct, that we had lower levels of maintenance on our highways, we have more bridges in need of serious repair, we have not maintained sufficient capacity in order to meet the needs of a growing economy and a growing American population. 
I regret to say that I am afraid the same prophecy can be made about the legislation that we are about to pass, and that is a serious commentary. It speaks to the level of our commitment to transportation as an important national priority. Transportation is not being singled out. We are doing an inadequate job in almost every area of our Nation's infrastructure. One of those areas in which I am particularly concerned is educational infrastructure. All over the country we see older schools crumbling because of lack of adequate maintenance and repair and rehabilitation. All over the country, we see children going to classrooms that don't have the kind of access to modern technology that an education at the end of the 20th century requires. We see students in portables and inappropriate educational facilities because there have not been the resources to keep pace with building the new classrooms that the expanding student populations require. So what we are encountering in our transportation system is replicated in our education system, also in water and sewer and other basic community health services. I hope that, as part of this debate on transportation in 1997, we will use this as a means of stimulating a national awareness to the fact that we have a much greater job to do in terms of building the basic systems upon which our people, our society, our free enterprise economic system depend. 
Having said that, there is a glimmer of hope in this legislation relative to the total adequacy of funds for transportation. While recognizing that the traditional means of funding transportation--so much money from the National Government through a Federal program, supplemented by additional funds from State or local sources--while those traditional sources are not likely to be adequate in order to maintain our current system and meet the needs for expansion, this legislation does call for some new opportunities for creativity and innovation and encouraging nontraditional funding to come into transportation--particularly, funding from the private sector. 
We started several years ago with a plan that encouraged States to set up State banks to engage in various forms of innovative financing--public-private partnerships, encouragement to early acquisition of highway corridors in order to lower the cost of right-of-way acquisition--a whole series of innovative ideas at the State level, with Federal support, in order to stretch our available dollars further so that we have a better chance of meeting the total demands that would be made upon transportation as one important part of our infrastructure obligations. 
This legislation builds on those past provisions. It expands the States' ability to set up those State-based infrastructure banks. It also will create a new Federal innovative financing program to work with the States where they have projects that will benefit by these kinds of new means of financing transportation and involving the private sector. I think that is going to be an absolute key if we are going to meet our obligation to future generations in terms of maintaining a transportation system that will give us the economic capabilities to sustain our global position as well as provide the mobility that the American people require for their own day-to-day life experiences. 
So, Mr. President, I am enthusiastic about the legislation that we are introducing today. I believe it represents a significant step forward in terms of accepting our national responsibility and doing it in a fair and balanced manner. I applaud those who have joined in this effort and look forward to this Senate passing this legislation at the earliest possible date so that before we recess for 1997, we can say as one of our accomplishments for this year that we have passed a significant national transportation policy and have that policy in place for the next 6 years, and we can get on with the business of benefiting by that new policy.

 Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. Chairman, this bill establishes wildlife observation, hunting, fishing, and environmental education as the priority public uses of the refuge system. We have found in the State of Florida that even wildlife observation can become incompatible if not carefully regulated and managed. 
For example, at Crystal River National Wildlife Refuge, visitors enjoy observing the manatees that this refuge was established to protect. The favored way of observing the animals is by swimming with them in the refuge waters. A few years ago, the Fish and Wildlife Service discovered that so many people were engaging in this activity that many of the manatees were leaving the refuge that was designed for their protection. The agency determined that this form of wildlife observation was occurring at levels that were incompatible with the purpose of the refuge and had to establish certain limits on when and where people could engage in this activity and how many could do so at one time. 
Am I correct that even those so-called wildlife-dependent activities that are considered priority public uses in the bill must be found to be compatible with the purposes of the refuges and the mission of the system? And, that as a part of this determination, the Fish and Wildlife Service must consider whether there are adequate funds available to administer the use in a manner that is compatible?

Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. Chairman, this bill--for the first time in law--would establish a definition for the term `compatible.' This is one of the single most important aspects of this legislation. Too often in the past, activities have been allowed on refuges that have harmed the fish and wildlife and habitats that these areas were designed to protect. There has been some concern that the definition used in the bill is overly vague. The bill defines a compatible use as one that will not `materially interfere with or detract from the purpose of a refuge or the mission of the Refuge System.' 
The House committee report on this bill further clarified that what this language means is that a use is compatible if it will not have a tangible adverse impact on refuge purposes. Is it also your understanding that this is what is meant by this definition?

Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. Chairman, the third part of our amendment concerns the issuance of permits for such uses as electric utility rights-of-way that may be of longer than 10 years in duration. 
The underlying bill requires that all non-wildlife-dependent uses be reevaluated every 10 years to ensure they are still compatible. The language of our amendment directs that for uses that are authorized for more than 10 years, such as utility right-of-way the Fish and Wildlife Service will evaluate compliance with the original terms and conditions of the permit and not the authorization of the right-of-way itself.

Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. Chairman, some have pointed out correctly that, in the case of unforeseen changes in circumstances, it may occasionally be necessary to adjust a use to ensure that it remains compatible. My understanding is that utility companies have been willing and able to make minor adjustments to their facilities to ensure that they remain compatible. 
Mr. Chairman, am I correct to understand that this amendment will still allow the flexibility to make such adjustments to facilities that have been authorized for more than 10 years in order to ensure that they remain compatible?

Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I'm pleased to have the opportunity to discuss the National Wildlife Refuge System Improvement Act of 1997. It is a long overdue organic act for our magnificent refuge system. In 1991 and again in 1993, as chairman of the Subcommittee on Fish and Wildlife, I introduced the National Wildlife Refuge System Management and Policy Act--legislation which was very similar to that which is before us today. 
My aims then were straightforward. First, to clarify that the purpose of the National Wildlife Refuge System is to conserve our Nation's diversity of fish, wildlife, and plants and their habitats. Second, to improve the process used to determine which public uses shall be allowed on the refuges. Third, to require the development of comprehensive conservation plans for each of the refuges and ensure that the public has ample opportunity to participate in the planning process as it does in planning for our national parks and national forests. Fourth, to lay out clear affirmative duties for the Secretary of the Interior to protect the integrity and plan for the appropriate expansion of the Refuge System. 
My bill had the strong support of conservation groups like the Wilderness Society, the National Audubon Society, Defenders of Wildlife, and the Sierra Club. Thanks to Senators Chafee, Kempthorne, and Baucus, my bill also enjoyed the support of the International Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies along with a variety of sportsmen's groups. The Environment and Public Works Committee reported that bill in the 103d Congress but unfortunately we were not able to bring the bill to the Senate floor because a number of procedural holds were placed on the bill. 
In the last Congress, the House introduced and passed a radically different bill that would have harmed our Refuge System. President Clinton indicated that he would veto the House bill but fortunately, it was not acted upon by the Senate. 
The bill before us today is not identical to the bill I introduced in prior years. It is not exactly how I would have drafted it, but I am very pleased that it addresses the four major areas that I outlined above: a mission statement for the system, a formal process to assess the compatibility of refuge activities, a planning requirement, and duties for the Interior Secretary. 
Of course, even with passage of this bill, the Refuge System will only meet its potential to conserve the Nation's fish and wildlife if the Congress appropriates the funds necessary for its proper management. I am pleased that the House has approved a healthy increase for this purpose in its fiscal year 1998 Interior appropriations bill and will work to ensure that the Senate does as well. Senator Kempthorne and I and 18 of our colleagues have written to the Appropriations Committee to urge such funding.

 Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, as we send our children and grandchildren back to school to begin another academic year, we as a nation focus on the vital role of education. 
Florida is proud of its role in developing and nurturing colleges and universities of excellence that have educated generations of America's leaders. One of those institutions, Florida A&M University, has been cited as `College of the Year' by the editors of Time magazine and The Princeton Review. 
The editors cited the school's outstanding enrollment of National Achievement Scholars, its position as the only historically African-American college to offer four Ph.D programs, and dramatic enrollment growth. 
This well-deserved national recognition is a tribute to the students, alumni, and staff of Florida A&M University. It also reflects the outstanding leadership of President Frederick Humphries, who has led the institution with vision and dedication since 1985. 
When classes began this academic year, enrollment exceeded 10,000 students, up from 3,200 in the mid-eighties. Florida A&M University enrolled its largest freshman class ever this fall. 
Further, the number of bachelors' degrees awarded since 1991 has more than tripled, from 463 in 1991 to 1,524 last year, surpassing Howard University as America's leading granter of undergraduate degrees to African-American college graduates. 
During this decade, Florida A&M University, along with Harvard, has been a leader in attracting National Achievement Scholars. Florida A&M University led the Nation in 1992 and 1995; Harvard in 1993 and 1994. 
While all this was occurring--enrollment growth, more degrees awarded and more scholars enrolled--overall admission standards increased. In the past 10 years, Scholastic Aptitude Test scores of Florida A&M University-bound students rose more than 200 points. 
Mr. President, I have been honored to visit Florida A&M University on many occasions. I have experienced the special spirit on campus, in the classrooms, and among the greater Florida A&M University family of alumni, faculty, administrators, and students. 
Our State and Nation are better because of Florida A&M University and its commitment to educational excellence. Congratulations, Rattlers.

 Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I am honored to welcome Judge Alan Gold to the Federal bench in the Southern District of Florida. For more than 25 years, Alan Gold has served the State of Florida with honor and distinction. I have no doubt that his outstanding service will continue in his new assignment. On September 15, Judge Gold will be sworn in, along with Mr. Donald Middlebrooks, in ceremonies in Miami, FL. 
Much of my confidence in Judge Alan Gold comes from his lifelong commitment to the people of our State. He began his career more than 25 years ago, when he represented Dade County in both State and Federal courts. 
In 1975, Alan Gold moved into private practice, where he developed wide recognition and respect as a leader in land use and environmental law. 
In 1984, when I was Governor, I appointed Judge Gold to Florida's Land Management Study Committee, a vital post given our State's long period of rapid population growth. In addition, Judge Gold served Florida for 6 years as general counsel to the Florida High Speed Rail Transportation Commission, an entity created by the State legislature in 1984 to develop a high-speed rail transportation and magnetic levitation demonstration project. 
Mr. President, in addition to his substantial professional experience, Judge Gold will bring respected academic credentials to the Federal bench. In 1989, nearly 25 years after completing a masters in law at the University of Miami School of Law, Judge Gold was invited to join his alma mater's faculty as an adjunct professor. It was a wise invitation to an outstanding role model for future generations of legal professionals. 
As a result of his distinguished efforts in the public interest and in private practice, Alan Gold was appointed to Florida's Eleventh Judicial Circuit Court, where he has served with integrity and competence. His peers and colleagues have overwhelmingly endorsed his abilities. In a 1994 survey of regional attorneys by the Dade County Bar, 92.8 percent of respondents rated Judge Gold's performance as qualified or exceptionally qualified. 
As a circuit court judge, Alan Gold served both in the family and criminal divisions, where he presided over felony jury cases. Despite the demands of a heavy caseload, Judge Gold continued his efforts to improve the legal system for Florida communities, families, and individuals. He was appointed to the Florida Supreme Court's Family Court Steering Committee and has recently chaired an effort to develop a model family court. 
During the confirmation process, Judge Gold's support transcended partisanship. In addition to the support from Senator Connie Mack and myself, he earned strong endorsements from U.S. Representatives Lincoln Diaz-Balart of Miami and E. Clay Shaw of Fort Lauderdale. 
Mr. President, Judge Alan Gold has long provided an example of academic diligence, legal acumen, judicial excellence, and determination to serve Floridians. I am pleased that he will join the Federal bench, and extend my congratulations to him, his family, and the Senate for its prompt review and confirmation of this worthy nominee.

Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I am very pleased today to be working with Senators Kennedy, Abraham, and Harkin in their efforts to reauthorize the Refugee Act of 1980. 
Through the Office of the U.S. Coordinator for Refugee Affairs, we are better able to develop a comprehensive national strategy to help our State and local governments assimilate the individuals that have fled persecution, injustice, and war. 
The Federal Government has welcomed these individuals to our shores. Our local governments welcome them to their communities--and through the programs of the Office of Refugee Resettlement, we make sure that they acquire the skills needed to adjust to our society and become self-sufficient, productive members of society, as soon as possible. 
More than 17,000 refugees and entrants arrived in Florida in fiscal year 1996. In fiscal year 1995, this number was higher than 36,000. Between 1992 and 1996, more than 70,000 refugees and entrants settled in Dade County. Without the programs of the Office of Refugee Resettlement, this influx would be a tremendous financial burden on State and local governments. 
The arrival of refugees and entrants is a Federal decision; these costs should not be shifted to State and local taxpayers. 
By reauthorizing the Refugee Act of 1980, we can continue to offer protection from those fleeing persecution--and make sure that we are addressing the needs of these vulnerable members of our society in a humane, just, comprehensive, and cost-effective manner. 
Senator Kennedy is to be commended on his leadership on this issue. I am proud to work with him and our Senate colleagues to ensure the passage of this measure.

Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, it will be 35 years ago this coming Wednesday, August 6, 1997, that the people of Jamaica were granted their independence from Great Britain. This significant event for the people of Jamaica is cause for great celebration by the citizens of Jamaica as well as all of us who cherish democracy. The United States and Jamaica have been partners working together helping to bring democracy throughout the world. The government of Jamaica was the first of our allies joining our efforts to come to the aid of its neighbor Haiti. Jamaican American citizens contribute to the richness of our nation's cultural heritage. They strengthen the rich cultural and social ties between our nations. 
It is therefore fitting that we take this opportunity to congratulate the people of Jamaica during their four day `Emancipation Day' celebration August 1, to August 4, 1997.

Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, today I am honored to join my colleague and friend Senator Connie Mack in introducing the Immigration Reform Transition Act of 1997. 
This is a bipartisan, humane solution to concerns that were raised by the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996. 
Thousands of families, hard-working, law-abiding, taxpaying individuals who had followed every rule and regulation up to the passage of the immigration bill last year now live in fear of deportation. 
Working together, and working swiftly, Congress has the opportunity to correct this injustice. 
The families that we are helping came to our Nation in the 1980's. Our own Government encouraged them to flee the Communist regimes and civil unrest of Central America at that time. 
Our Nation's foreign policy gave them a safe haven; our Immigration Service allowed for their work authorization and they settled in to our American society. 
Ten or fifteen years later, these families have homes here. They have U.S. citizen children. They have jobs; they pay taxes, and they make tremendous contributions to our local communities. 
The Illegal Immigration and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 severely restricted the avenues of relief that were traditionally available to aliens who have resided in the United States on a long-term basis. 
Then, on February 20 of this year, the Board of Immigration Appeals interpreted a section of the immigration bill as applying, in all essence, retroactively. 
Forty thousand Nicaraguans in Miami alone who, under the old law, would have qualified for suspension of deportation, would now be deportable because of Board's decision. 
Families would be torn apart. Close-knit communities would evaporate. Businesses would suffer. In my heart, I don't believe this was the intent of Congress when the immigration bill was passed last year. 
Janet Reno made an important step toward fairness and justice on July 11, when she agreed to review the Board of Immigration Appeal's decision. I supported her action, and appreciate her help in finding a humane and reasonable solution to these concerns. 
In her July 11 press release, the Attorney General informed Congress that legislative action would be necessary to fully resolve this specific issue. 
I am pleased to work with her, and my Senate colleagues, today to take the first step in accomplishing our legislative goal. 
This legislation is crafted very narrowly. It recognizes the special circumstances in which Nicaraguans, and other Central Americans, came to the United States during a specific period of time--when they were fleeing the unrest created by the Communist governments of the era. 
It allows this specific group of individuals and families to complete the process that they may have started 10 or 15 years ago--and importantly--to complete the process under the same set of rules that they started with. 
Critics may say that we are undoing the immigration bill of last year. We are not. The 4000-per-year cap on suspensions of deportation is still intact, we are just not applying it to this specific group of individuals. 
The stronger standards to qualify or suspension of deportation still remain current law. We are just allowing this group to go through the process without changing the rules in midstream. 
Also important: this is not an amnesty bill. Each request will be decided on a case by case basis. If someone has been of bad moral character, they will not qualify. If someone has not been here the required amount of time, they will not qualify. 
We are saying that those who played by the rules will have a fair opportunity to have their case heard by an immigration judge. 
I welcome comments from the broader community on this legislation, and look forward to the opportunity to work with the Senate Judiciary Committee and Immigration Subcommittee to ensure its future success. 
I ask my Senate colleagues to join with me today in this bipartisan effort to ensure fairness to hard working families.

Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to speak in favor of the pending amendment, which will restore $30 million of funding for the National Endowment for Democracy. 
Mr. President, unless we reverse the decision that has been made by the Appropriations Committee, the Senate will be on record as eliminating this unique, flexible, low-cost, public-private partnership, an important foreign policy instrument, an instrument that has proven important today in furthering U.S. interests, as important today as it was in 1983 when established with the active support and leadership of President Ronald Reagan. 
Mr. President, the Senate has debated the future of the National Endowment for Democracy virtually every year in recent years. Every year, proponents of continuing the Endowment have prevailed, but the fight has taken a toll. NED's budget has been whittled down by almost 15 percent over the last 3 years, and its authorization is now flat for the next 2 years. Any further cuts will severely hamper NED's ability to carry out its important programs. That is why so many of us are here today concerned that its current budget be sustained at the requested level of $30 million. 
Mr. President, although we once again are debating NED's future, this recurring debate has been, and continues to be, more about our future and our view of the world than it does this one Federal initiative for democracy. It is also about how the American people view America's role in the world. In examining that world view, several fundamental questions must be answered. 
First and foremost is the question of whether it is in the interest of the United States of America to remain actively engaged in world affairs. 
Second, is it in our interest to creatively promote peaceful democratic change? To put it another way, is it in our interest to stay one step ahead of tomorrow's costly conflicts by promoting peaceful democratic change today? 
Finally, does the National Endowment for Democracy make a positive contribution to advancing these interests? 
Mr. President, I submit that the answer to each of these questions is yes. I would briefly wish to cite two examples. 
First, in our own hemisphere, the United States has had a long and, I suggest, painful and destructive history of being involved in our hemisphere only when we faced an immediate security, political, or economic crisis. Once the crisis passed, our interests waned and then evaporated. 
Mr. President, in large part because of some of the things that the United States led in the last 50 years, we now have a period of democratic government within our hemisphere that we have never known since Christopher Columbus discovered the new world. Those democracies, from Guatemala to Argentina, are new. They are enthusiastic. But they lack the kinds of deep roots that will assure their longevity. It is exactly nations such as that and building those roots that will sustain democracy that the National Endowment for Democracy has exhibited, and it is in exactly those circumstances within Latin America and the Caribbean that the endowment has played such an important role, and I submit will play an even more important role in the future. 
Another prime example is China. Those who understand and care about the need for long-term democratic change in China strongly support the National Endowment for Democracy. That is because the National Endowment for Democracy is working with human rights activists to bring to life abuses by the current regime. The endowment is also creatively exploring openings at the local level to help officials establish independent elections. 
NED is on the ground working in China every day in ways that very directly further United States national interests. No other agency of this Government is equipped to carry out the kind of innovative grassroots work as is the National Endowment for Democracy. 
If we are to successfully engage China over the long term, if we are positively to influence United States-China relations, if we are to reverse our past history and demonstrate a sustained commitment to democratic institutions within our nearest neighbors in the Western Hemisphere, the National Endowment for Democracy must necessarily be an essential ingredient in that United States policy. 
Indeed, the long-term impact we are confident NED to have in China is on display today in Mexico, where the Endowment's support of the Civic Alliance, a coalition of non-governmental organizations in that country, paved the way for electoral reform that resulted in the freest elections in Mexico's history. The result has been a deepening of democracy, and a sense among the Mexican people that casting ballots can produce positive change in their lives. The result is a government which is far more stable and responsive to the people's needs. The Mexican people benefit, and so do we. 
Mr. President, China and Mexico are only two examples of NED's work. Indeed, the Endowment is helping dissidents in over 90 countries, including dissidents who are fighting for democratic change in Cuba, Burma, Nigeria, Belarus, Serbia, and Sudan. NED is working to strengthen democratic institutions in Russia, Ukraine, and South Africa. This is vitally important work. And there are many informed observers who see it the same way. 
Former Secretaries of State Baker, Eagleburger, Haig, Kissinger, Shultz, and Vance are on record in support of NED. According to them: 
During this period of international change and uncertainty, the work of the NED continues to be an important bipartisan but non-government contributor to democratic reform and freedom. We consider the non-governmental character of the NED even more relevant today than it was at NED's founding * * * 
Former National Security Advisors Allen, Carlucci, Brzezinski, and Scowcroft also are on record in support. They have stated that: 
The endowment, a small bipartisan institution with its roots in America's's private sector, operates in situations where direct government involvement is not appropriate. 
It is an exceptionally effective instrument in today's climate for reaching dedicated groups seeking to counter extreme nationalist and autocratic forces that are responsible for so much conflict and instability. 
Eliminating this program would be particularly unsettling to our friends around the world, and could be interpreted as sign of America's disengagement from the vital policy of supporting democracy. The endowment remains a critical and cost-effective investment in a more secure America.

Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I would like now to take this opportunity to clarify some misconceptions that have arisen regarding NED and its work over the years. Two of those misconceptions are contained in the report accompanying the bill we are now debating. 
The report states that, because NED was created to support democratic movements behind the Iron Curtain, it is no longer needed. Nothing could be further from the truth. Indeed, NED was never intended to be a cold war institution. 
In Ronald Reagan's speech that helped launch the Endowment, he offered the following vision of NED: 
. . . To foster the infrastructure of democracy--the system of a free press, unions, political parties, universities--which allows a people to choose their own way, to develop their own culture, to reconcile their own differences through peaceful means. 
He referred to the work of Western European parties assisting counterpart institutions and of the foundation looking into `how the United States can best contribute as a nation to the global campaign for democracy now gathering force.' 
It is true that the Endowment supported Solidarity and other dissidents behind the Iron Curtain. 
But that represented a small percentage of its funding. In fact, in the early years of the Endowment, approximately half of its funds went to support the growing democratic movements in Latin America. 
This had nothing to do with the cold war and everything to do with the reason NED was created and the reason it exists today--because America believes that the spread of democracy is good for the people of these countries, and ultimately, for the people of the United States as well. 
NED's work in the Middle East, in East Asia, in Central Asia, in Africa, in Bosnia, in Mexico, demonstrates that in the post-cold-war world, efforts to foster civil society are even more relevant today than they were when the Endowment was created. 
The report accompanying this bill goes on to state that NED was never intended to be a `private-public partnership.' According to the Congressional Research Service, which carefully researched NED's legislative history, `While NED was originally established as a private entity, private funding was not required. Neither the congressional debate in 1983, nor the National Endowment for Democracy Act--the law establishing NED--indicates private source funding would be required.' 
It is true that NED does raise some funds in the private sector, primarily to support its International Forum for Democratic Studies, which is a research center and clearinghouse for worldwide information about democracy. In addition, NED has calculated that its funding leverages over 70 cents for every program dollar it grants. 
The essential point, however, is that the founders of NED never imagined that this would be a privately funded effort. To the contrary, because NED serves the national interest, it is an entirely worthwhile expenditure of the Federal Government. 
Several other misperceptions have dominated this debate in the past. Let me address them as well. 
Opponents have suggested that the Endowment duplicates those of the Agency for International Development. AID Administrator Brian Atwood reported to the House Committee on International Relations in March 1996, following an extensive review of hundreds of programs funded by his agency and those of the Endowment. His report stated: 
We found that USAID and NED do not duplicate, but rather complement each other's efforts. 
In the same report, Atwood outlined a series of steps that AID and NED have taken together to make sure that this lack of duplication continues. 
NED and its supporters also have been accused of keeping a GAO report calling for a reassessment of NED's funding from being issued. This is a nonissue originally raised in print by a long time NED opponent. The facts are quite simple: 
The General Accounting Office, after an exhaustive study of U.S. Government programs to promote democracy, concluded that there was no significant overlap between those funded by NED and official agencies. 
Referring to the stops that have been taken between AID and NED to make sure the lack of duplication between their programs continues, a GAO official wrote to House International Relations Chairman Gilman and Ranking Member Hamilton that the Agency's concerns about potential overlap had been allayed. 
Another charge frequently made against NED is its funding is used disproportionately for travel. Some of the over 300 programs that are funded annually by the Endowment involve the use of experts from the United States and abroad who travel pro bono basis to share their knowledge and experiences with grassroots Democrats. 
Many of these trips are under adverse circumstances to places that can hardly be regarded as vacation spots and the trips are not only working trips but frequently quite rigorous for participants. The amount of free time that is donated by these experts is rather significant in dollar terms. 
Opponents also charge NED with funding meaningless conferences. NED funds in fact are used to assist organizations working inside countries. Occasionally NED funds gatherings of democrats in exile who cannot operate in their home countries. Countries such as China and Cuba fall in this category. 
An example of a conference pointed to as insignificant by some NED critics is a meeting held in 1995 in Zagreb, Croatia. In fact this particular conference brought together activists from all the countries of the former Yugoslavia at the height of the war to exchange information. 
The meeting succeeded in matching funders and civic groups in the region in desperate need of help. Apart from bringing together democrats in a war situation the meeting has led to a number of worthwhile projects in a region that desperately needs to build up its civil society. 
Mr. President, NED deserves our support. I urge my colleagues to support a restoration of this funding.

Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, at the completion of these brief remarks, I will send an amendment to the desk. 
Mr. President, last year in consideration of this same appropriations bill, the Senate and the House adopted and the President signed into law what is known as the Alu-O'Hara bill. This is legislation which was the result of a tragic circumstance in which two law enforcement officers called to a hostage-taking scene were seriously burned when the hostage taker set on fire the structure in which the hostages were being held. These two law enforcement officers were subsequently discharged from the law enforcement agency because of their severe injuries, and in the course of their discharge they lost their insurance coverage. So now they were two heroes out of work, lifetime injuries and without health insurance. 
This Alu-O'Hara bill, which we adopted last year, provided that law enforcement agencies would provide to any public service officer `who retires or is separated from service due to an injury suffered as the direct and proximate result of a personal injury sustained in line of duty while responding to an emergency situation or in hot pursuit with the same or better level of health insurance benefits that are otherwise paid by the entity to a public service officer at the time of retirement or separation.' The enforcement for this was a reduction in that local law enforcement block grant award. 
Mr. President, as I indicate, this has been the law since last year. It is currently in the House appropriations bill. Frankly, we are seeking an opportunity to put this into substantive law so we will not have to continue to rely upon the appropriations bill as the means of continuing this important protection for law enforcement officers which has strong support by all the major law enforcement agencies in America. 
So I send this amendment to the desk and will ask my colleagues for its favorable adoption when we consider these matters on Tuesday.

Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, before we complete action on the Agriculture and Related Agencies appropriations bill, I wanted to compliment the chairman, Senator Cochran, and the ranking member, Senator Bumpers, for their very hard work and very able leadership. 
All the Members know of the many demands placed on the subcommittee to fund many worthwhile projects. We also know that the discretionary spending available to the Agriculture Subcommittee has been reduced substantially over the last several years. This very limited funding makes it difficult to fund all the many excellent proposals that have come to the subcommittee for consideration. 
Mr. President, while I understand the limitations of the subcommittee to fund all good projects, I would be less than frank if I did not mention my disappointment with a number of items that were left out of this bill. One of those projects not funded by this bill is an Extension Service training project to help bring behavioral and mental health services to rural areas. 
As the Members know, the Extension Service is a long and well established institution that exists across the country in almost every county in America. In the minds of most people, the Extension Service and the Extension agents are focused on agricultural and farm issues. While this impression is true the facts also reveal that the Extension Service is called on more and more to help meet family, health, and social service needs of our rural residents. The array of services offered by the Extension Service is established at the State level by State priorities. In my State, and I am sure in other States, as well, the Extension Service is doing a great job in meeting rural needs for a broad array of services. 
In Florida, for example, following Hurricane Andrew, our Extension agents were trained to provide threshold counseling services to rural residents who were under severe emotional stress following the storm. The agents were trained to identify problems, provide initial counseling and to refer severe cases to appropriate professionals. This training was provided by the University of Florida and the program received a USDA award. The University of Florida was recently invited to North Dakota to train Extension agents following the floods. Initial reports from the Director of the Extension Service in North Dakota is that the program `exceeded expectations'. 
Mr. President, for a very small amount of money this bill could have created a small program or center to be a national resource for the Extension Service. This center would train the agents from the various States to be better able to provide the counseling services that they are more and more being called on to provide. The demand for these services is due in large part to the lack of service providers in rural areas. 
Mr. President, it is my hope and expectation that the Department will look at this proposal very carefully and reprogram some funds or include it in the Department's next budget request. It is a program that has been proven to work. It is a program that meets a very large need in our rural areas. In the process of this review I would also expect that the Department meet with the appropriate officials at the University of Florida who have a track record in this area.

Mr. GRAHAM. 
Mr. President, I rise today to offer a simple, straightforward sense-of-the-Senate resolution regarding natural disasters. 
The rising cost of natural disasters is a ticking time bomb that we, in Congress, are doing little to address. Since 1989 the cost to taxpayers has been nearly $40 billion. 
Just this past weekend Hurricane Danny hit portions of Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, and my State of Florida. Although Hurricane Danny was a relatively small storm, just imagine if Hurricane Danny had been of the magnitude of a Hurricane Hugo or Andrew. The damages would be exponentially larger. 
Hurricane Danny serves as a stark reminder of the ticking time bomb. We should keep in mind that we are only very early in what is expected to be an extremely active hurricane season. The time to act is sooner rather than later. 
My resolution would state that it is the sense of the Senate that Congress consider legislation to deal with the rising cost of natural disaster head on--before another megadisaster occurs. 
What will it take for Congress to focus on this ticking time bomb? Another Northridge earthquake that comes with a sticker price of $8.6 billion? Another Hurricane Andrew or Hugo to cost the Federal Government $6.2 and $3 billion, respectively? 
Helping our Nation better prepare for natural disasters will require Federal, State, and local efforts as well as initiatives from the private sector. My resolution states that Congress should consider Federal legislation embracing the following principles: 
First, people living in areas that are prone to natural disasters should assume a practical level of responsibility by acquiring private property insurance. 
The problem is that in some areas, especially in my home State of Florida, it is very difficult for individuals to get adequate private property insurance. This leads us to the second principle. 
Second, the insurance industry, in partnership with the Federal Government, should develop a new mechanism to spread the risk of natural disasters minimizing the cost of these disasters for the Federal Government. The goal of spreading the risk is to make private insurance available and affordable for everyone. 
Third, a partnership should be forged between the private sector and governments at all levels to encourage better disaster preparedness and response. 
No one is expecting to find a magic solution to natural disasters. The National Weather Service cannot play like the FBI's bomb squad and snip a few strategically placed wires to disarm future hurricanes. Nor can the National Science Foundation invent a way to stop the movement of tectonic plates and ensure that there will be no more earthquakes. But the Federal Government can at least begin discussing creative ways to assist States in preparing for and responding to natural disasters. 
That is the intent of my resolution--to begin the discussion. We cannot continue to fund natural disaster after the fact. 
We must take steps to make sure that every person in disaster prone areas has available, affordable property and casualty insurance. 
We must work with the private sector to find creative ways of shifting the responsibility for the risk of disasters to the private sector and reduce the cost to the Federal Government. 
We must encourage States to better prepare themselves for disasters and to have a clear game plan to respond when hit by a natural catastrophe. 
In the next few days I will circulate a letter that I encourage all my colleagues to join me in signing. The letter will be sent to the U.S. Department of the Treasury asking for their assistance and guidance in developing such an initiative. 
Mr. President, our Nation has been beset by an unusual series of natural disasters, some of which have occurred as recently as the past few days in Mississippi, Alabama, and my State of Florida and others earlier this year in the upper Midwest. This sense of the Senate asks that the Senate at an appropriate future time consider legislation that embodies the following principles: That persons who live in areas of risk of natural disaster should assume a practical level of personal responsibility for the risks through private insurance; second, that the insurance industry in partnership with the Federal Government and other private sector entities should establish new mechanisms for spreading the risks of catastrophes that minimize the involvement and liability of the Federal Government; and third, a partnership should be formed between the private sector and Government at all levels to encourage better disaster preparation and respond quickly to the fiscal and financial impacts of catastrophic natural disasters. 
Mr. President, the purpose of this sense of the Senate is to encourage those entities that have been working over the last 2 years to try to embody these principles into legislation that could be presented to the Congress, that in light of what has recently occurred they redouble their efforts to present to the Nation an appropriate partnership framework that would both mitigate and respond to natural disasters. 
Mr. President, I send to the desk the sense-of-the-Senate resolution.

Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I am pleased that once again the Senate has chosen to continue our Nation's commitment to the future through the exploration and study of space. Especially as we stand here today knowing that the Sojourner Rover continues its unprecedented exploration of the surface of Mars. NASA is now turning its attention to the many new missions scheduled for future, including the construction of the international space station. Mr. President, we must continue to invest in this pursuit of knowledge. 
No one can predict the outcome of our investment in the space program, but one thing is certain, and that is generations to come will benefit from the knowledge and experience gained from the investment we have made, and continued exploration of space will present many more opportunities to learn. 
First, the space program will provide significant contributions not only to Americans, but people all around the world. We have already seen results of space-related research in life science. Recently I learned of a NASA technology which is now being used to help diagnose vision problems in our children. This coming school year, the State of Florida will be using this technology to screen all students in kindergarten. By discovering vision problems at such an early age, we will prevent many of these children from falling behind because of undetected impairments. This type of commercial application of NASA born technology is virtually limitless. 
Second, our Nation's leadership role in high technology research and development must be maintained and enhanced. The aerospace industry is a significant area of America's international competitiveness. 
Third, projects such as the international space station help to continue and expand cooperation among the world's nations. Our collaborative efforts with the Europeans, Japanese, and Russians only serve to strengthen our relations in a global community. Our space program enables us to exchange exciting ideas with the world, and accelerate the pace of our own technology and space exploration. 
Mr. President I believe that these are very compelling reasons for continued support of our space program. NASA deserves our support. Congress and the administration should provide the appropriate resources needed for NASA to successfully manage and enhance our space program. We must invest in our future, and invest in ourselves.

Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation that will both support our national agricultural industries and bolster the abilities of American consumers to make educated choices about the fruits and vegetables that they purchase for their families: the Imported Produce Labeling Act of 1997. 
This important legislation extends our current country-of-origin labeling laws--enacted as part of the Tariff Act of 1930--to require country-of-origin labeling of imported produce at the final point of sale, which for most Americans is the grocery store. It would bolster food safety, give consumers more information, and allow American growers to achieve some benefit from the heavy investment they make in complying with health, labor, and environmental laws. 
Mr. President, country-of-origin labeling is not a new idea. For decades, European nations, Japan, and Canada have informed consumers about the origins of the produce available for purchase. 
One need only to walk through a supermarket in Paris to notice the international nature of the produce sold. Shoppers can purchase apples from the United States, tomatoes from Holland, grapes from Spain, pears from France, peaches from Italy, and oranges from Israel. 
Our American supermarkets also carry agricultural products from a wide range of exporting nations. Why, then, do our consumers lack the advantage that their French, Japanese, and Canadian counterparts enjoy: the ability to make informed choices about the food they feed to their families? 
It doesn't have to be that way. For 18 years, Florida grocery store customers have enjoyed the benefits of a law very similar to what I am proposing today. 
In 1979, during my first term as Governor, the Florida State Legislature enacted the Produce Labeling Act, a law that is now administered by the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services. 
The law has been implemented with almost no additional regulation and at extremely small cost to Florida taxpayers. 
Extra supermarket inspections are not required. Department of Agriculture inspectors verify compliance with the law as a part of their already planned, routine inspections of all retail food stores in the State. 
Florida's policy also expends limited time and money. A standard inspection takes approximately 15 minutes, the time needed to review displays and document discrepancies. And enforcement costs are estimated to be less than $40,000 annually for the department's inspection of over 23,000 retail food establishments. 
While costs are low, the benefits that Floridians have enjoyed as a result of this policy are significant. 
Most importantly, consumers are armed with important information about the products upon which they spend their hard-earned paycheck. Here's what that means: 
The `Made In The USA' label can draw more customers to domestic produce, thus supporting American farmers and the U.S. economy as a whole. 
Consumers have the ability to seek out foreign produce that is known for its high quality. 
Shoppers have the information needed to boycott products from countries that exploit workers with low pay, poor working conditions, or child labor. 
American families can protect their own health from products subjected to unsafe or unsanitary produce-handling practices. 
The Florida Department of Agriculture reports that the State's labeling law has been both well-received and cost-effective. It costs a store only $5 to $10 per week to implement, and the estimated industry compliance costs statewide are less than $200,000 annually. 
In plain terms, this means that for less than $200,000, consumers in a State that has 14 million residents and each year welcomes over 30 million visitors have the basic information regarding the origins of the produce on their supermarket shelves. That's a small price to pay for the ability to make educated choices in the marketplace. 
It is my goal--and that of my cosponsors, Senator Craig of Idaho and Senator Johnson of South Dakota--to ensure that all American consumers are armed with the same ability to make informed choices as their counterparts in Florida, Europe, and Japan. 
We are introducing this legislation because the changing nature of the agriculture market demands changes in our Nation's trade policy. 
Sixty-seven years ago, when the Tariff Act of 1930 was enacted, fresh fruits and vegetables were exempt from labeling laws. 
The Tariff Act dictates that items are required to be labeled with their country of origin only on their outermost container. In the case of fresh fruit and vegetables, the outermost container is the shipping container, from which produce is removed long before it ever reaches the consumer. 
Obviously, the consumer market has changed dramatically since 1930. Whereas imported produce was once almost nonexistent in the United States, it now constitutes a $1.7 billion industry. In fact, 60 percent of our winter fruits and vegetables come from Mexico alone. 
As imports have become a fixture in the domestic marketplace, our growers and their associations have argued for country of origin labeling. But this is an issue that unites producers and consumers. Research has shown that an overwhelming number of American consumers would like to know where their produce is grown--and they want that information made readily available. 
Our bill is not cumbersome. It simply says that a retailer of a perishable agricultural product imported into the United States shall inform consumers as to the national origins of that product. 
Nor is it designed to give American products an unfair advantage in the marketplace. In fact, foreign growers who believe that they grow a superior product to ours see this legislation as a prime opportunity to sell more of their goods in American supermarkets. 
And finally, this bill does not suppress free trade or the free market system. It simply seeks to level the regulatory playing field. Shoppers in the European Union and Canada benefit from a county-of-origin labeling requirement. American consumers should have access to the same kind of information. 
The Imported Produce Labeling Act constitutes one of the most important agriculture trade initiatives that will come before us during this Congress. It is a vital part of efforts to bolster one of the most critical elements of our free-enterprise system: informed choice. I urge its speedy passage.

Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I thank my colleague, Senator Torricelli. 
I rise today to oppose the amendment offered by our colleague from New Mexico. The policy of the United States toward Cuba is too serious, it is too delicate, it has too many ramifications to be settled in debate which this morning will provide 5 minutes per side to discuss the nuances of what is entailed in this seemingly humanitarian and benign amendment. If there is to be a change in policy, it should be the result of studied consideration of all of the implications of specific proposals, not extracting three items from a complex set of relationships that involve not only Cuba but also many other nations in the world. 
Second, there is no need for this amendment. One of the principal parts of this amendment is related to humanitarian aid, particularly after a natural disaster--a very appealing concept for Americans. It is so appealing that, in fact, the United States is already the largest donor of humanitarian assistance to Cuba. In the last 4 years, the U.S. Government has licensed more than $150 million of humanitarian assistance to Cuba, more than the total of all other nations combined. So the United States has not stood by in times of humanitarian need for the people of Cuba. 
With reference to travel to Cuba, American citizens already can travel to Cuba once a year with virtually no restraints in order to attend to a humanitarian family need. This would open the gates beyond that to allow unlimited visits to Cuba.

Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, today I am introducing a bill, cosponsored by Mr. Mack and Mr. Grassley, which will expand the existing south Florida high-intensity drug trafficking area [HIDTA], to include the Interstate 4 corridor which runs between Daytona Beach and the Tampa Bay area in my home State of Florida. 
Illegal drug activities continue to plague the State of Florida. In 1994, more than $5 billion in funds from cocaine traffic were laundered through south Florida and the I-4 corridor. Over 23 metric tons of cocaine were seized during that same time period. Over 250 organized drug trafficking groups have been identified as operating between south Florida and the I-4 corridor. These statistic are staggering. While some progress is being made to limit the spread of illegal drugs, there is still a lot of work to be done. I continuously hear from the law enforcement personnel operating along the I-4 corridor that they are being overwhelmed by the growth in drug trafficking activities in that area. Drug traffickers are becoming increasingly proficient in distributing drugs. They are using high technology equipment to evade detection. They have an extensive communications network, and almost unlimited funds with which to pursue their illegal activities. Current law enforcement assets are simply no match for the highly organized drug operators. Seized assets from drug traffickers in this area during 1996 included over $425 million in currency and property. The basic problem is how do we compete with these highly funded and well equipped drug trafficking organizations? 
I repeatedly hear the same story from the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Customs Service, the FBI, and the Florida Department of Law Enforcement; they need help. This is a problem which impacts not only the State of Florida, but it also impacts the entire Nation as illegal drugs are distributed from the I-4 corridor to other parts of the country. 
The statistics on the growth of the drug industry along the I-4 corridor are sobering. Nationwide, cheap, high purity heroin is making a comeback in popularity, and demand is on the rise. The drug syndicates are meeting the growing demands. Cocaine continues as a popular recreational drug. As long as there is a demand, drug dealers continue to find ways to meet that demand. Despite a massive education and public awareness campaign to warn teenagers about the dangers of drug use, teen drug arrests have more than doubled in the past 5 years. Some of those arrested are as young as 12 years old. In the Orlando area, over 1,500 teens between the ages of 12 and 17 years old were arrested for using or selling illegal drugs in 1995. The city of Orlando, through which the I-4 corridor runs, ranked fifth in the Nation for cocaine-related deaths per capita in 1995. Other crimes such as shootings, carjackings, robbery, and gang activities are byproducts of the drug problem, and are also on the rise in our local communities. We are truly battling for the lives of our young people. 
There is a general feeling of despair among the various agencies trying to combat this problem. We need to be proactive in helping them. Because of its central location, the I-4 corridor is emerging as a hub used increasingly by international drug syndicates to distribute their goods throughout the Nation. This is a problem which affects us all. The use of illegal drugs and drug related deaths are increasing at an alarming rate. 
As we saw with the establishment of a HIDTA in south Florida, a coordinated Federal, State, and local effort is the key to bringing this problem under control. This HIDTA has proven itself as a model of efficiency and effectiveness in controlling the expansion of drug activities in the area. The existing south Florida HIDTA is a model of the results which can occur when the various law enforcement agencies mount a coordinated battle with a unified strategy of engagement. We have seen moderation in the drug related incidents since the south Florida HIDTA was established in 1990. In fact, the success of the south Florida HIDTA is partially responsible for the increase in illegal drug activity along the I-4 corridor. 
Expanding this successful HIDTA to include the I-4 corridor makes common sense. It will allow us to devote additional resources to combat a problem which has nationwide implications. By implementing a coordinated enforcement strategy directed at combating the problems of illegal drugs and violent crime, we demonstrate to the drug community that we are dedicated to facing this battle head on--and finally, it will show that we are committed protecting the future of our young people.

Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I would like to engage in a colloquy with the distinguished ranking member, Mr. Leahy, regarding the meaning and intent of a provision in this bill, section 569. This involves a matter of great importance to my colleague Mr. Leahy and myself--human rights. I commend my colleague for his leadership on this important issue. 
I share your concern that U.S. foreign assistance funds not be used by perpetrators of gross violations of human rights. I also share your interest in ensuring that perpetrators of such crimes are brought to justice. To this end, section 569 of this act prevents funds made available under this act from being provided to any unit of the security forces of a foreign country if the Secretary of State has credible evidence to believe a member of such unit has committed gross violations of human rights. Would the Chairman agree that this provision only applies to units of the security forces of a foreign country that currently have members against whom we have credible evidence of gross violations of human rights.

Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today with Senator Moynihan and my other colleagues to submit a resolution that will allow Holocaust survivors to receive the reparations they so rightly deserve. 
There are over 125,000 Holocaust survivors living in the United States. My State of Florida houses the second largest population in the United States Approximately 500,000 survivors worldwide are living out their final days. Many still suffer from the injuries they received during the Nazi occupation. While the German Government has acted in good faith in attempting to take responsibility for the horrible actions of the Nazi regime, many survivors have been prevented from receiving reparations due to burdensome eligibility requirements. 
We recognize that since 1952, Germany has contributed to the compensation of those that survived the Holocaust. However, after 50 years, hundreds of thousands of elderly Holocaust survivors are still unable to afford critically needed medical care, and many of their medical problems are a direct result of their years in Nazi concentration camps. 
In May, it was acknowledged that, in addition to the regular pensions and medical insurance the German Government provides, war disability pensions are still being paid to veterans of the Nazi armed forces and the non-German Waffen-SS, Hitler's special death squads. According to the Wiesenthal Center, the SS disability pensions alone are three times the reparations paid to the Holocaust survivors. 
This resolution calls for the German Government to expand and simplify its system of reparations so that a medical fund may be established to cover medical expenses for Holocaust survivors throughout the world. Regardless of nationality or the length or place of internment, Holocaust survivors will be guaranteed the opportunity to live the remainder of their lives with the knowledge that they will always be able to receive the medical care they need. 
Holocaust survivors have lived enough of their life in suffering. We must now insure that they live the rest of their lives in dignity. We hope the German Government will continue to accept responsibility and set up a fund to help the victims of Nazi terror. I urge my colleagues to join us in this endeavor.

Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, today I rise to offer my support for the pension provisions which are contained in the tax bill we are considering today. As a result of the bipartisan cooperation which has been demonstrated throughout this process, many American workers will move closer to a secure retirement. These provisions help a broad spectrum of workers and employers, and will contribute toward making pensions more available, equitable, portable and simpler. 
First, the provisions will expand coverage among workers at small businesses. 
The statistics concerning the lack of retirement coverage among small business workers are astounding. According to the Small Business Administration, only 13 percent of workers in businesses with less than 20 employees have pension plans and only 38 percent of workers in businesses employing between 21 and 100 employees currently have plans. 
Two provisions in this bill will address this problem. This bill will encourage even the smallest of small businesses to help their employees save for retirement through IRA payroll deductions. These payroll deductions are the easiest way for workers to save for their retirement. This bill clarifies that if a small business man or woman permits IRA payroll deductions, they will not be threatened with liability under ERISA. 
Small businesses will also be encouraged to establish pension plans by allowing partners and self-employed individuals to receive matching contributions under the same rules applicable to incorporated businesses. More small business owners will establish retirement plans because of this change. 
Second, this bill will help women. Although women are entering the work force at a larger rate than ever before, 25 million working women still do not have pension plans--this represents nearly 3 out of every 5 women who work in the private sector. Of these 25 million women, 12 million are employed by small businesses. 
Unfortunately, many of these working women have no pension plan. Many of these women would like to make contributions to an IRA, but cannot because their husband participates in an employee-sponsored retirement plan and tax law says that she cannot make a deductible 
contribution to an IRA because his participation is attributed to her. 
The Finance Committee bill eliminates a spouse's participation from the considerations relevant to contributing to a deductible IRA. With this provision, all Americans--working women, working men, and homemakers--will now have the opportunity to save, regardless of their spouse's participation in a retirement plan. 
Because of our bipartisan work on this issue, Susan Stratton of Tallahassee, FL, will be able to begin contributing to her retirement while her husband Charles continues contributing to his corporate plan. 
Susan is the owner of Care Packages, Inc., and will be able to save $2,000 per year in an IRA. 
Similarly, John Pollack of Orange County, FL, will be able to begin saving for his retirement because of this bill. As the owner of Allrite-Foto, John has not made any IRA contributions due to his wife Lorraine's corporate plan involvement. If this bill is enacted, John will be able to save for retirement along with his wife. 
As you can see by these two examples, this provision--championed by Senator Roth and Senator Breaux for many years--will be beneficial for both spouses. 
Third, the pension provisions in this bill begin to address a significant need in the pension area--portability. American workers are changing jobs much more frequently than ever before. Over the course of a 40-year career, the average worker will hold seven different jobs. Yet only 50 percent of current 401k plans accept rollovers from other plans. 
As a result, it has become imperative that these workers be able to transport their retirement plans when they change jobs. 
This bill makes it more attractive for businesses to accept rollovers. The bill provides that a plan will not be disqualified just because funds rolled over from a new employee's previous job come from a fund which has become disqualified. 
Although this is a good step, I will in coming days be pushing for more pension portability. Similar defined contribution plans should also be able to roll into each other. Money in a retirement stream should be kept there until retirement. Government plans should be able to roll into private-sector plans. Private sector plans should be able to roll into nonprofit plans and nonprofit plans should be able to roll into Government plans. 
Fourth, this bill will make pensions simpler to administer. One of the main reasons employers cite for not establishing or expanding pension coverage is red tape. The Finance Committee bill eliminates some of the paperwork burden it now takes to administer a pension. 
This bill asks that the Treasury Department and Department of Labor issue guidance on the use of new forms of electronic pension notification, and provides for the review of current rules to accommodate new technology. 
With the help of this new Internet and telecommunication technology, pension information will be more readily available to workers and less costly for employers to produce. 
Finally, this bill enhances pension security. Both businesses and workers will be helped by a provision phasing up the 150 percent of current liability limit. Under current law, companies are limited in the amount they can contribute to their employees' defined benefit plan. I believe companies should be able to increase funding of their pension plans in order to fully meet the needs of their future retirees. 
Companies can better budget if they have greater flexibility in what they put in their plan--and workers are better off, because the more companies contribute, the more secure their retirement. This bill gives companies that flexibility. 
Each of these provisions, as well as others I have not mentioned, will improve our private pension system. It is not all we should do to prepare for retirement in the 21st century, but it is a good start. 
I have been honored to work closely with many of my colleagues in bringing about these bipartisan pension changes. Senators Hatch, Grassley, Jeffords, Breaux and Moseley-Braun have been instrumental in bringing about these reforms, and I would like to commend them, and others, on their efforts. 
By finding this common ground on both sides of the political aisle, we are working to ensure that the American workers of today will have a more secure and prosperous retirement for tomorrow.

Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to thank Chairman Roth for working on this tax legislation in a fair, bipartisan manner. In particular, this bill includes several educational initiatives that will have a positive impact not only on the people of my home State of Florida but on the citizens--of every income--in our Nation as a whole. 
First, I applaud the chairman's provisions with respect to prepaid college tuition plans. Currently, 16 States offer and manage college savings programs, 5 States are in the process of implementing such programs, and the other 29 States have legislation pending or are studying the feasibility of creating these programs. 
Last year, Congress clarified the tax treatment of participation in prepaid college tuition plans. The 1996 Small Business Protection Act provided that any prepaid or savings State entity is tax-exempt. The act also clarified that earnings under prepaid programs are not taxed until distribution, and--when distributed--earnings would be taxed to the student beneficiary. 
Under the proposal approved by the Finance Committee, distributions from prepaid college tuition plans will be 100 percent tax-free. In addition, the definition of qualified higher education expenses will be expanded from current law. Under this legislation, tax-exempt benefits will now include room and board, as well as tuition, fees, and related expenses. Thus, families who plan ahead can lock in today's rates for almost all expenses incurred in their children's education. 
The legislation will have immeasurable benefits for our Nation's families. For example, Barbara and Jack Alfonso, who live in Miami, FL, have a 10-year-old son, Adrian. Back when Barbara finished high school, her parents could not afford to send her to college. She decided to take out loans to attend secretarial school. It took her 7 years to pay off those loans, so Barbara knows what it's like to be burdened with debt. 
Barbara and Jack decided that they didn't want their son to be faced with the same obstacles. So, when Adrian was 5, they invested in the Florida Prepaid College Tuition Program. They will make their last payment in October of this year. 
Adrian is a good student, and he deserves the opportunity to further his education. And because his parents chose to put aside money for his future by participating in the State's tuition program, Adrian will have this opportunity. Now Adrian can become one of the first college graduates in the Alfonso family. He can rest assured that his hard work will not have been in vain--that college is not a dream for him but a reality. 
As Barbara tells it: `The best thing about this plan is that it gives me peace of mind.' Thanks to a prepaid college tuition plan, Barbara knows that her son will be able to go to college. And thanks to this program, two hard-working parents are able to give their child what they never had. Their son will be better off than they were. 
With this legislation, families throughout our Nation will be better able to plan and save for their children's education. First, parents can save for their children's education without paying taxes. Second, parents can purchase tuition at today's rates and then withdraw this money when their children begin school. Tomorrow's education can be secured at today's prices. 
I would also like to thank Chairman Roth for including a portion of my school construction tax proposal, which would assist small and rural school districts. The provision that was included in this bill will positively impact issuers of small school construction bonds. These issuers will be exempt from arbitrage rebate requirements up to $10 million. Currently, there is a $5-million limit which applies to all bonds. 
With this provision, we are specifically helping small school districts to lower the cost of building new schools. I hope that this legislation is just the beginning of much more which this Congress will do to make a significant and substantial dent in the problem of school construction and rehabilitation needs. 
On behalf of all of our Nation's families, I would like to thank Chairman Roth for his efforts regarding these education initiatives. I think Barbara Alfonso says it best: `We can't cut corners when it comes to education.' Barbara is right. This legislation will allow us to invest in our most precious resource--our children--who are, of course, ultimately our future.

Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, this tax legislation, as passed by the Senate Finance Committee, goes a long way toward assisting our Nation's families. For example, reducing the capital gains tax rate from 28 percent to 20 percent will stimulate savings and investment. This increased investment will, in turn, foster economic growth. 
In particular, I would like to draw your attention to a provision that will have considerable impact on our Nation's families: the capital gains exclusion for homeowners who sell their primary residence. Under current law, capital gains from the sale of principal residences is subject to taxation, with two limited exceptions. First, under the rollover provision, taxpayers can rollover gains from the sale of a principal residence into a new residence. They can then defer any capital gains tax--but only if the purchase price of the new home exceeds the adjusted sales price of the old one. And to restrict this even more, the new residence must be purchased within 2 years of the sale of the first home. 
A second exemption ties the capital gains tax to age. At age 55, a taxpayer can exclude up to $125,000 of any accumulated gain from the sale of a principal residence. And this is a one-time-only opportunity. Worse yet, even this is restricted. To qualify for the exclusion, the taxpayer must have owned the residence and used it as a principal residence for at least 3 years during the five years before the sale. Also, a taxpayer is eligible for the exclusion only if neither the taxpayer nor the taxpayer's spouse has previously benefitted from the exclusion. 
Unfortunately, the very provisions which are supposed to relieve homeowners from taxation often prevent them from making the soundest financial decisions. Under current law, to avoid being taxed, most people wait until they are eligible for the one-time exclusion, or they make what may be imprudent decisions regarding the sale of their homes. 
For example, many families, after their children have moved out, would like to sell their home and buy a less expensive one. However, the rollover provision means that they will have to pay taxes on the difference between the profit gained on the sale of their old home and the cost of their new home. As a result, these families often choose to buy more expensive homes or not to sell their home at all. Mr. President, that is not right. People should be able to move when and where they want to, not when the tax code makes it financially possible. 
Under the legislation passed by the Finance Committee, taxpayers of any age could exclude gain on the sale of a principal residence of up to $500,000 for married couples filing a joint return, and up to $250,000 for single taxpayers. To be eligible, the taxpayer must have owned and used the home as the principal residence for at least two of the last 5 years prior to the sale. The exclusion will generally be available once every 2 years. 
This legislation will give our Nation's families more freedom in deciding where to live. This decision can be based on family circumstances rather than on the Tax Code. The bill would also relieve nearly all families of the burdensome record-keeping requirements and constraints on decision making under current law. The impact on our Nation's families will be tremendous, and I look forward to the enactment of this legislation. 
This bill will significantly impact our Nation's families. It will promote investment and boost long-term economic growth. And a healthy economy translates to increased opportunities for American families to secure their future. Our Nation's taxpayers work hard to provide for their families. This legislation is a chance for us to lend them a helping hand in that task. 
I thank the Chair.

Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, it is intimidating to speak after such poetic eloquence. One of the joys of serving in the U.S. Senate is to be part of a permanent class with Senator Byrd. Some students have left for their homes and Fourth of July activities and some of us were able to share in his just concluded statements on behalf of his wonderful State. I thank the Senator.

Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise this afternoon to introduce the United States-Caribbean Basin Trade Enhancement Act, and I am proud to be joined by my colleagues Senators DeWine, Mack, McCain, and Moseley-Braun. 
This bill will enhance both our economic and national security, while at the same time strengthening that of some of our closest and most loyal neighbors and allies--the nations of the Caribbean Basin. 
Over the last decade, the United States has played a vital role in the spread of democracy and the growth of free enterprise throughout the Western Hemisphere. 
Today, every nation in the Western Hemisphere--with the notable, lamentable exception of Cuba, where despotism and communism are taking their last gasps of life--has a democratic government and is opening its economy in unprecedented ways. 
Democratic elections have become the norm rather than the exception, and hemispheric trade integration is a common goal. 
But we in the United States must not allow success to breed neglect. 
Now is not the time to turn away from Latin America and Caribbean or to turn our back on our backyard, something, unfortunately, that we have done all too often in the past. 
Continued attention is required to consolidate and institutionalize these democratic and economic gains. 
As we have seen recently in Haiti, economic and political instability in the Caribbean region can have tragic consequences and impose enormous costs to the United States. 
We must remain vigilant and engaged to ensure that other nations of the Caribbean Basin do not experience similar turmoil and tragedy. 
The United States-Carribean Basin Trade Enhancement Act is part of our effort to consolidate democracy and economic stability in the region. 
This act will bring tremendous benefits to the United States as well. 
It is in both our economic and our national security interests to enact this legislation. 
It will enhance our economic security both by opening new markets for American goods, and by strengthening the economies of our closest neighbors. 
Increased economic growth among the nations of the region will provide growing markets for U.S. products. 
The United States enjoys a trade surplus with the Caribbean Basin. 
Historically, our economy has been the chief beneficiary of a lowering of trade barriers between the Caribbean Basin and the United States. 
The United States' trade position relative to the Caribbean Basin countries improved dramatically following the implementation of the 1983 Caribbean Basin Initiative, from a deficit of $700 million in 1985 to a surplus of $2.0 billion in 1993. 
On a per capita basis, our surplus with the Caribbean has consistently outplaced our surplus with any other region of the world. 
In the past 3 years alone, U.S. exports to the Caribbean Basin countries have increased by 22.8 percent. 
This act also provides incentives for continued legal and regulatory reform that will make it easier for U.S. products to compete in the markets of the Caribbean Basin. 
By conditioning full benefits on the progress of economic reform, this act will benefit Americans as well as the people of the Caribbean. 
It will open Caribbean markets to U.S. goods and services, and expand opportunities for U.S. businesses to enjoy the fruits of economic expansion that is occurring in the region. 
Let me give a couple of examples of ways that the incentives in this legislation will help increase U.S. exports to the Caribbean. 
First, in order to receive any benefits, a country must demonstrate its commitment to undertake its World Trade Organization obligations on or ahead of schedule, and it must participate in negotiations toward the completion of a hemispheric free-trade agreement. Those are requirements for initial participation in this program. 
Second, Caribbean nations must meet certain economic requirements to receive the full benefits of our legislation, which are only available after the initial 3-year period. 
These full benefits include equitable and reasonable market access to U.S. companies, protection of intellectual property rights, protection to investors and investments, aggressive action against corruption, transparent and competitive procedures in government procurement, and the adoption of internationally established rules on customs valuation. 
This legislation also encourages our trading partners to enhance U.S.-Caribbean cooperation in fighting drug trafficking. 
Mr. President, this legislation is not a free ride. It is a two-way street. 
We are providing these nations with economic benefits, while at the same time expecting them to take steps that will be good for American economic interests. 
This act will strengthen Caribbean economies while providing incentives to implement reforms that will open new markets, and reduce risk, for U.S. companies who wish to compete in the Caribbean market. 
It will protect U.S. trademarks from piracy, permit U.S. companies to compete fairly for government procurement contracts, and help to eliminate corruption. 
This is a good deal for both the United States the countries of the Caribbean Basin. 
Our security interests are also at stake here. We have seen time and again how economic instability can foment political turmoil, which in turn can require American political or military involvement. 
In the past, as the citizens of my home State of Florida know all too well, economic and political instability has also resulted in massive refugee flows to the United States, which place an unfair burden on U.S. taxpayers. 
Second, the Caribbean has been one of the principal transit regions for drug traffickers moving their poisonous cargo from the source countries of South America. 
Several years ago, our efforts at reducing drug trafficking in the Caribbean were so successful that we diverted the traffickers to the Southwest border. 
Unfortunately, recent law enforcement efforts along the Southwest border have resulted in intensified relocated, re-energized narcotics trafficking in the Caribbean. 
It is critical that the people of the Caribbean Basin have real opportunities in the legal economy so they are not forced to turn to drug trafficking to feed their families. 
In addition, the recent World Trade Organization decision on bananas could have a devastating effect on the economies of several countries in the region, thereby exacerbating the potential for people to turn to illegal activities. 
Strengthening Caribbean economies through enhanced trade and economic activity will help keep drugs off the streets of America, and out of the hands of America's children. 
Mr. President, trade integration will occur in this hemisphere, whether we choose to be part of it or not. 
It is in our interest to bring more countries into bilateral and multilateral trade agreements with the United States. 
If we fail to seize this opportunity, others will take our place of leadership, and our economy will be the loser. 
This legislation gives us an opportunity to set the parameters of trade agreements, so that we can ensure that United States' interests are secured, and that truly fair trading relationships are established. 
There is no region in the world in which the United States has a stronger and more mutually beneficial relationship than the Caribbean Basin. 
This bill will enhance our trading relationship with our neighbors and have tremendous benefits for the United States. 
I urge my colleagues to consider and support the United States-Caribbean Trade Enhancement Act as a demonstration of our commitment to encouraging economic and political stability and to furthering the democratic progress that has been made in our hemisphere, and around the world.

Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleague from Rhode Island--the distinguished chairman of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee--in the introduction of an initiative to help address our nation's infrastructure needs. Our initiative aims to harness the resources and energies of the public and the private sectors, and have them work in concert to ensure that a 21st century America has a modern system of roads, highways, and other critical public works assets. We are calling this new partnership the Transportation Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act of 1997--TIFIA. 
Mr. President, the numbers paint a stark and disturbing picture of the state of our nation's infrastructure. A survey of our nation's community water system estimated that a minimum of $138.4 billion are needed over a 20 year period for the purposes of installing, upgrading, or replacing water mains, pipes, and processing facilities. Houston Mayor Bob Lanier, Chairman of the Rebuild America Coalition, reports that `57 percent of highway pavement in all but a handful of states is in poor or mediocre condition; in some of the most populous regions, the figure is as high as 70%.' The U.S. Department of Transportation estimates that our nation must invest an additional $33 billion in surface transportation in order to stay ahead of future growth, congestion, and development. We are also faced with 187,000 structurally deficient and functionally obsolete bridges. According to the Federal Highway Administration, a minimum of $8.2 billion is required to improve and correct bridge conditions. 
In addition to these needs, we are faced with the important and challenging task of balancing the federal budget in order to preserve the health and prosperity of future generations of Americans. In order to achieve this goal and still meet our nation's infrastructure needs, our actions must be a combination of traditional as well as new and innovative means of financing. 
Specifically, I believe that we need to do the following: First, we need to provide for a more efficient use of resources going to improve and develop our nation's infrastructure. We need to better utilize cost-saving tools and techniques so that we can stretch our nation's public investment dollars as far as possible in this time of limited federal funds. Second, we need to raise the level of traditional resources so that states will have a larger pool of dollars, including federal dollars, available for infrastructure development. Third, we need to attract and facilitate new and innovative financing sources, such as private investment. By fostering greater private-public partnerships, we can provide additional funding resources for states and communities. Finally, we need to develop and support innovative construction and financing mechanisms, such as State Infrastructure Banks (SIBs) and the legislation we are introducing today, TIFIA. 
In the face of declining federal investment in infrastructure amidst tight fiscal constraints, TIFIA enables communities and states to utilize creative methods for addressing our nation's infrastructure needs. TIFIA would provide $800 million in federal credit assistance for major transportation infrastructure projects costing in excess of $100 million. The legislation provides a model in which states could use federal loans to develop large projects that have the potential to be self-supporting. 
Projects which would be candidates for receiving assistance under this program include: The Western Extension of the George Bush Freeway in Texas; the Broken Arrow Expressway in Oklahoma; the widening of US Highway 219 in New York; the Interstate 15 rebuilding project in Utah; the Border Infrastructure project in Southern California; and the Florida High Speed Rail. 
In my state of Florida, the state's Department of Transportation is proposing the Florida High Speed Rail project, which would connect the major metropolitan areas of Miami, Orlando, and Tampa, and be the first true high speed rail line in our nation. Japan and nations in Europe have already made major progress in high speed rail transportation--but this progress has been contingent on support from their national governments. TIFIA could provide important credit support for such projects of national significance. 
Creative financing for infrastructure development is crucial as we enter the 21st century and are confronted with the extensive needs which can only be addressed through new and visionary approaches. In this Congress, we are scheduled to reauthorize both the Clean Water Act and ISTEA, the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act, which governs our nation's highway system--two major infrastructure bills which address pressing needs that affect the daily lives of citizens nationwide. 
As we focus on these two major bills, it is my hope that we will take steps to improve the state of our nation's public works system in a substantial and effective manner. TIFIA should be used as one model for taking these steps using a creative private-public financing approach. In fact, it is my hope that this legislation will be incorporated into ISTEA. 
We should create new partnerships which will help us to meet current and future needs while acknowledging the limited resources available to us in this fiscal environment. If we are to rebuild our nation's infrastructure, and lay the groundwork for the next generation of transportation infrastructure, we will need to develop innovative financing programs such as TIFIA. 
It is my hope that after we complete the Highway Program bill--with the inclusion of TIFIA as an innovative financing title--we will develop similar mechanisms for addressing the financing requirements of other major public works needs such as clean water systems and perhaps even school construction. 
We should heed the wisdom found in the words of Daniel Burnham, a prominent architect who served as chairman of a commission charged with redeveloping the District of Columbia, `Think no small ideas. Small ideas have no magic to stir men's minds.' Let us use this bill as the starting point from which to make a serious and substantial dent in our national development needs. 
Mr. President, I thank the Chairman for his leadership in this area and look forward to working closely with him as we work to pass this bill and reauthorize the Highway Program.

Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, first, I thank my good friend and colleague from Nevada for his generosity in allowing us to take a moment at this time to introduce some distinguished guests. I might say that Senator Bryan visited Colombia in March of this year and I think came away with some of the same positive feelings about the country and the people that I share. 
We are honored today to have visitors, members of the Colombia National Senate: First, Senator Luis Londono, the President of the Colombia National Senate; Senator Amilkar Acosta, the President-elect; Senator Luis Velez, Senator Carlos Garcia, Senator German Vargas, and Senator Luis Perez. 
I present these members of the Colombia National Senate to the Members of the United States Senate.

Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, although none of us received all of what we wanted in this budget deal, I rise today not to point out its deficiencies. Rather, I want to highlight the key strength of this agreement--It makes Medicare and Medicaid smarter. 
It is smart to root out fraud and abuse; it is smart to permit competition; and it is smart to promote preventive health care. 
Cracking down on those who abuse the system is smart. Paying less for more goods and services is smart. And preventing diseases is smart. 
My colleagues and I are here today not to eliminate Medicare and Medicaid. Nor are we here to preserve the status quo. We are here to make these programs smarter--More efficient, more equitable, and more solvent. 
We were faced with the politically unenviable task for paring Medicare by $115 billion and Medicaid by $23 billion to accomplish the overarching goal of this legislation--a balanced budget by the year 2002. 
Both health care providers and senior citizens will share in the burden of meeting this goal. 
Mr. President, before we ask providers and senior citizens to sacrifice, we should feel confident that this budget makes inroads into cutting fraud and abuse out of the program. 
Just yesterday, my esteemed colleague, Senator Harkin, discussed some of our mutual concerns in this area. Senator Harkin and I have long been champions of anti-fraud measures and pro-competitive measures, sometimes to the consternation of health care suppliers and providers. 
Senator Harkin was right yesterday when he spoke strongly about Medicare's need to begin negotiating for the best deal on supplies and equipment, like other Federal agencies have done. It makes no sense that Medicare--the largest single purchaser of health care services in the country--has to follow a price list set out in seven pages of statute rather than relying on competition. 
Our efforts in this area have been bipartisan. Just last week in the Senate Finance Committee, I, along with Senator Nickles, sponsored an amendment to give the Health Care Financing Administration the authority to institute competitive bidding for part B services. My colleagues on the Committee stood with me as we unanimously adopted this proposal. It is my sincere hope that my House colleagues will follow suit. 
Implementation of competitive bidding is one way in which Congress can show that we have finally gotten serious about preserving the integrity of Medicare. 
Another way is to begin a serious crackdown on fraud in not only Medicare, but Medicaid. Congress simply cannot be taken seriously when it asks for sacrifice if we are not willing to push as hard as we can to prevent people from ripping off the system. 
Let me give you some brief examples of the rampant problems we face in this area: 
In 1993, in my home town of Miami Lakes, FL, the Office of the Inspector General reviewed 100 claims for Medicare reimbursement by a home health agency. About out-fourth of these claims did not meet Medicare guidelines in that they either were unnecessary, not reasonable, or not provided at all. The home health agency made $8.5 million in claims, $1.2 million did not meet the reimbursement guidelines. 
Two years ago, I spend a day working in the U.S. Attorney's Office in South Florida. There I learned that it is easier to get a provider number under Medicare than it is to get a Visa card. It is easier to get a blank check signed by Uncle Sam than it is to get a household credit card. 
Mr. President, we cannot repair the Medicare Program without first cracking down on fraud and abuse. Those who play by the rules should not have to suffer at the hands of cheats and swindlers, and this Congress should put an end to the conditions in which cheats and swindlers thrive. 
I would like to thank Chairman Roth for including many of the Medicare anti-fraud proposals contained in bipartisan legislation I introduced with Senator Mack and Senator Baucus last month, including mandating that providers post a $50,000 surety bond to participate in the Medicare program. 
While a $50,000 bond is relatively inexpensive to post for scrupulous contractors, at a cost of about $500, the requirement has achieved tremendous results in my State. Since implementation of the requirement, the `fly-by-night' providers have scattered like so many roaches when the lights are turned on. 
Durable Medical Equipment Suppliers have dropped by 62 percent, from 4,146 to 1,565; home health agencies have decreased by 41 percent, from 738 to 441; providers of transportation services have disenrolled from the State's Medicaid program in droves--from 1,759 to 742, a drop of 58 percent. Fewer providers bilking 
the State's Medicaid Program is projected to save over $192 million over the next 2 years in Florida. 
Mr. President, we have expanded the surety bond requirement not only to Medicare in this bill--but the Finance Committee also adopted my amendment to expand this requirement to Medicaid. 
This is just one of the many anti-fraud provisions included in this budget. I want to reiterate my thanks to Chairman Roth for his willingness to take a tough stance to ensure that Medicare and the State Medicaid Programs are run efficiently, without the graft we have seen overrun the programs in recent years. 
Finally, Mr. President, we must do as much as we possibly can to ensure that our seniors receive preventive care--`health care' not `sick care.' 
In the long run, we stand to save billions of dollars by providing early, regular, and preventive medical care, as opposed to acute, reactive, emergency care. It is both fiscally and physically prudent to prevent sickness before the fact and not after. 
We can start by covering colon cancer screenings under Medicare. We can save millions of dollars--and millions of lives--by detecting and treating this cancer in its early stages. Colon cancer is the second most frequent cancer killer in America, causing 55,000 deaths each year. But while it is estimated that screening and early detection and intervention could eliminate up to 90 percent of these deaths, Medicare does not currently pay for these preventive measures. 
Colon cancer screenings cost only $125-$300 apiece, and patients diagnosed through early detection have a 90 percent chance of survival. But if a patient isn't diagnosed until symptoms develop, the chance of survival drops to a mere 8 percent. Care for treatment in such cases can cost up to $100,000. The cost of not covering colon cancer screenings--in lives and in dollars--is unacceptable. 
It is also imperative that we eliminate co-payments for mammography. According to a 1995 study in the New England Journal of Medicine, women in the Medicare Program who have to pay some of the cost of mammography are far less likely to actually undergo the procedure. Only 14 percent of those women who had to make some kind of cash payment actually had a mammogram. In contrast, among women who had some kind of insurance to supplement their Medicare benefits, 43 percent had mammograms. Lack of supplemental coverage should not be a barrier to necessary and ultimately cost-saving medical treatment. Mammography should not be a luxury. It is a necessity. 
Mr. President, another necessary preventive measure is Bone Mass Measurement, the procedure which detects Osteoporosis. 
Osteoporosis is a debilitating bone disease which afflicts 28 million Americans and causes 50,000 deaths each year. Eighty percent of its victims are women. 
Osteoporosis fracture patients cost Medicare $13.8 billion a year. This cost is projected to reach $60 billion by the year 2020 and $240 billion by the year 2040 if medical research has not discovered an effective treatment. We can curb these skyrocketing costs by providing Medicare coverage of bone mass measurement. 
Because we now have access to drugs which can slow the rate of bone loss, early detection is our best weapon in the fight against Osteoporosis. It is only through early detection that we can thwart the progress of the disease and initiate preventive efforts to stop further loss of bone mass. 
In order to ensure that we detect bone loss early, we need to ensure that older women have coverage for bone mass tests. Unfortunately, coverage of bone mass measurement is inconsistent from state to state. Qualifications for testing, and the frequency of testing, differ from carrier to carrier and region to region. The current system is confusing and inequitable. Medicare Bone Mass Measurement Coverage should be covered uniformly in all states. 
Diabetes, with its tremendous financial and human toll, also deserves greater protection under Medicare. By providing for Medicare coverage of blood glucose monitoring strips and outpatient self-management training services, we can expect to see significant reductions in complications and expensive treatments. 
Coverage of test strips and self-management training services will allow people with diabetes to care for their own individual needs. In so doing, they can better prevent complications such as blindness, kidney failure and heart disease. 
Mr. President, this budget agreement is smart. It cracks down on fraud and abuse. It makes medical goods and services cheaper. And it promotes preventive health, saving millions of lives and billions of dollars. 
These are necessary and long overdue measures, and I thank my colleagues who have supported them.

Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I am very pleased to join my colleague Senator Mack in introducing the Florida Coast Protection Act today. It represents the next step in the State of Florida's long battle to preserve our beautiful coastal and marine ecosystem. 
Floridians oppose offshore oil drilling because of the threat it presents to the State's greatest natural and economic resource: our coastal environment. Florida's beaches, fisheries, and wildlife draw millions of tourists each year from around the globe, supporting our State's largest industry. Tourism supports, directly or indirectly, millions of jobs all across Florida, and the industry generates billions of dollars every year. 
The Florida coastline boasts some of the richest estuarine areas in the world. These brackish waters, with their mangrove forests and seagrass beds, provide an irreplaceable link in the life cycle of many species, both marine and terrestrial. Florida's commercial fishing industry relies on these estuaries because they support the nurseries for the most commercially harvested fish. Perhaps the most environmentally delicate regions in the gulf, estuaries could be damaged beyond repair by a relatively small oil spill. 
Over the years, we have met with some success in our effort to protect Florida's OCS. In 1995, the lawsuit surrounding the cancellation of the leases around the Florida Keys was settled, removing the immediate threat of oil and gas drilling from what is an extremely sensitive area. While I believe strongly that a long-term strategy is needed for the entire Florida coastline, the legislation we are introducing today focuses on a more near-term goal: to cancel six leases in an area 17 miles off the coast from Pensacola. The bill provides a mechanism for leaseholders to seek compensation under section 5 of the OCS Lands Act. Both Senator Mack and I believe the leaseholders have the absolute right to just compensation from the Federal Government in order to recover their investment. 
As the member of the Florida delegation who serves on the Energy and Natural Resources Committee--the committee with jurisdiction over this issue--I anticipate a difficult and precarious road to enactment. But the Florida delegation as a whole has no other choice than to pursue with all our combined abilities the goal we envision: to take another major step toward ensuring the wellbeing of the Outer Continental Shelf offshore the State of Florida. 
In addition to introducing this legislation today, Senator Mack and I intend to write to Chairman Frank Murkowski of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee to request a hearing on this bill as soon as possible. Floridians will have our very best effort to make the Florida Coast Protection Act Federal law.

Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I'm happy to have this opportunity today to introduce legislation to amend the National Parks and Recreation Act of 1978 to designate the Marjory Stoneman Douglas Wilderness and to amend the Everglades National Park Protection and Expansion Act of 1989 to designate the Ernest F. Coe Visitor Center. 
Ms. Douglas and Mr. Coe led the charge to establish Everglades National Park and raise public awareness to restore its vitality. 
I think most Americans know that Everglades National Park preserves the subtropical region at the southern tip of Florida. But what most people don't realize is that the park has been nominated by the United States and accepted by the world community as a world heritage site, a wetland of international significance, and a biosphere reserve in recognition of its international significance. It is the only site in the Nation that has received all three designations, which serves to underscore the superlative qualities of the park on a global scale. 
Everglades National Park is well known for its diverse and unique wildlife, including alligators and crocodiles, eagles, manatees, and various fish species. The park has 13 species of endangered birds. It has open prairies and extensive saltwater areas with sawgrass marshes, mangroves, and shallow bays. Its 1.3 million acres of wilderness make it the largest subtropical wilderness in the continental United States. 
In 1926 and again in 1928, Senator Park Trammel of Florida introduced legislation calling for an examination of the Everglades to determine if a portion could qualify as a national park. The National Park Service had made some preliminary inquiries into the matter when Ernest Francis Coe came forward to champion the idea of creating a national park in southern Florida. Coe came to Coconut Grove from New England in 1925 and was overwhelmed with the natural beauty and wildlife of the Cape Sable and Ten Thousand Islands area. He wanted to find some way to protect the bird rookeries and hammocks, and the establishment of a national park seemed like an ideal solution. 
Mr. Coe became the central leader in the campaign to create Everglades National Park. In 1928, he organized the Tropic Everglades National Park Association and is widely regarded as the Father of Everglades National Park. As a landscape architect, Mr. Coe's vision for the park recognized the need to protect south Florida's diverse wildlife and their habitats for future generations. His leadership, selfless devotion, and commitment to achieving this vision culminated in the authorization of the park by Congress in 1934 and its subsequent dedication by President Truman in 1947. 
While it is not required by law that Congress name park visitor centers, this legislation will demonstrate Congress' support for honoring Mr. Coe's legacy. Because of his central role in the establishment of Everglades National Park, it is also a fitting tribute that park visitors be greeted by the congressionally designated Coe Center. 
In 1947, Marjory Stoneman Douglas published her landmark book, `The Everglades: River of Grass,' which greatly increased interest in and concern for the Everglades. Ms. Douglas, who celebrated her 107th birthday on April 6, symbolizes the struggle to save the Everglades. Her pioneering work was the first to highlight the plight of the Everglades and ultimately served to awaken public interest in restoring its health. Ms. Douglas has dedicated her life to the defense of the Everglades through her extraordinary personal effort and by inspiring countless others to take action. Recognizing these accomplishments, in 1992 President Clinton awarded her to the Medal of Freedom, the Nation's highest civilian award. 
Ms. Douglas has consistently stated her wish to have Ernest Coe's efforts suitably commemorated at the park. She has expressed 
through her associates Dr. Sharon T. Richardson her delight with the idea of designating the Marjory Stoneman Douglas Wilderness area. Dr. Richardson has added her opinion that, `Nothing could mark her life more suitably than to give her name to this resplendent wilderness.' 
I can only echo that sentiment and add that nothing could be more appropriate during this 50th anniversary year of Everglades National Park, than the commemoration of these two legends as proposed in this bill. 
To quote from Marjory Stoneman Douglas' book `River of Grass:'  
There are no other Everglades in the World. 
They are, they have always been, one of the unique regions of the earth, remote, never wholly known. Nothing anywhere else is like them: their vast glittering openness, wider than the enormous visible round of the horizon, the racing free saltness and sweetness of their massive winds, under the dazzling blue heights of space. They are unique also in the simplicity, the diversity, the related harmony of the forms of life they enclose. The miracle of the light pours over the green and brown expanse of saw grass and of water, shining and slow-moving below, the grass and water that is the meaning and the central fact of the Everglades of Florida. It is a river of grass.

Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I would like to join with my distinguished colleague, Senator Moynihan, the ranking member of the Finance Committee, along with both Republicans and Democrats on the Finance Committee to seek a restoration of job creation and economic growth incentives for U.S. businesses in Puerto Rico. 
Last year's tax legislation eliminated the longstanding incentive that applied in Puerto Rico: section 936. Efforts were made to replace section 936 with a new wage credit provision in section 30A, but even that provision is scheduled to expire. The legislation enacted did not provide for any tax benefits for new companies locating in Puerto Rico or existing companies expanding their operation on the island. The legislation we introduce today will make permanent wage credit benefits of section 30A to companies seeking to locate or expand their activities in Puerto Rico. 
Puerto Rico's economy is directly related to the economies of Florida and many other States. Most of the materials and many services used by manufacturing facilities in Puerto Rico are supplied from the States. Puerto Rico is also the center of economic activity for the entire strategic Caribbean region. Any downturn in the economy of Puerto Rico would have serious negative implications for the States that do significant business with the island as well as for the Caribbean Basin as a whole. 
The bill we introduce today would tie tax benefits directly to wages paid and investment made in Puerto Rico. It is targeted, efficient, and has the broad bipartisan support of the public and private sectors in Puerto Rico. It is a provision that we should act on now. We should not await a significant downturn in the Puerto Rico economy before taking action. It is clearly desirable and necessary to act this year if we are to increase economic conditions in Puerto Rico to levels consistent with those we should expect for all American citizens.

Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, we have talked about the principles that are represented by our action in legislation. Let me talk about an important principle. That is the principle that when we are dealing with lives and we are dealing with the destruction and the aftermath of a catastrophe, it is not the time to inject political ideology on unrelated subjects. I suggest that has been the policy of this Senate, that has been the policy of this Federal Government. 
Let me just give two examples of that policy. On September 21, 1989, Hurricane Hugo slammed into Charleston, SC, and 29 people were killed in South Carolina as a result of Hurricane Hugo. One week after Hurricane Hugo hit South Carolina, this Senate passed, by a vote of 100-0, disaster assistance legislation. On the same day, it passed in the House of Representatives, and the following day, September 29, 8 days after the disaster, President Bush signed that into law. A Democratic Congress, a Republican President, and in 8 days we responded to a major disaster within our Nation. 
In my own State of Florida, on August 24, 1992, Hurricane Andrew devastated the southern part of our State, killing 40 people and destroying 25,000 homes. On September 8, President Bush requested $7.7 billion of relief. Ten days later, the House and Senate passed the President's recommendation. It was signed into law on September 23, 1992, 30 days after the hurricane had done such devastation. 
Mr. President, that is the kind of schedule, that is the kind of cooperation between a Congress of one party and a President of another that we should expect, that all Americans should expect, in the event of a disaster that causes extensive damage and loss of life. 
Contrast those two past experiences with what we are, hopefully, about to conclude today as it relates to the flooding in the Midwest. It was on March 19 of this year that the President made his official request for disaster funds. After that date, the disaster became even more severe as flooding occurred as a result of the severe winter. Today, on June 12, we hopefully will pass the legislation which will go to the President for his signature. 
The principle is that we should not allow a repetition of what we are experiencing in this concluding chapter of the suffering of the people of the upper Midwest. They deserve to be treated with the same dignity, respect, and sense of urgency that we accorded the people of South Carolina in 1989, that was accorded to the people of my State of Florida in 1992. 
Mr. President, I commend those who have worked so hard to bring this issue to a resolution. I wish we had been congratulating ourselves on this, not on the 12th of June, but many, many weeks earlier. I hope we have learned a lesson from this experience, and that lesson is, deal with the plight of people, not politics, when it comes to humanitarian relief.

Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, today, as I did once before in January of this year, I rise to speak about an issue which is of vital importance to this Nation, the retirement security of our people into the 21st century. 
Mr. President, the facts are startling. Fifty-one million working Americans are not covered by any type of retirement plan. An incredible 87 percent of workers employed by small businesses, businesses with fewer than 20 employees, have no private retirement or pension coverage. Less than 40 percent of the 33 million Americans, age 65 and older, today collect a pension. These numbers are very, very disturbing. 
There are three foundations for a secure retirement: Social Security, personal savings, and a pension. Each one of these foundations is eroding. Social Security is unlikely to increase. Personal savings rates are falling. Fewer of today's workers will retire with a lifetime pension. 
In January, I spoke and mentioned some of the reasons that pension coverage fails to reach so many workers. Some of those reasons include the fact that our work force is changing. For the most part, our pension laws have not kept pace with the changes in the American work force. Think about current workers in an era of tremendous employee mobility--you don't work an entire career for one company, as was the typical pattern for our parents and grandparents. Small business is a tremendously vital part of our economy. Yet, those very small businesses are faced with obstacles in establishing retirement plans. 
There has been a decline in union membership, and unionized workers are the most apt to be covered under a defined benefit retirement plan. There is a shift away from manufacturing jobs toward service and retail, and, again, pension coverage is higher in manufacturing sectors than in these new expanding areas of the American economy. 
Knowing that these trends will continue, it is obvious that we need to make certain that our pension laws have kept pace with the changing American work force. My goal is to ensure that each American who works hard for 30, 40 years, or more, has every opportunity for a secure and comfortable retirement. I share this goal with many of my colleagues, including Senators Orrin Hatch, Charles Grassley, and John Breaux, all of whom join me today in introducing this bipartisan bill. 
To achieve the goal that every American who works hard for a lifetime will have a secure retirement and pension, we have focused on five areas: Expanded coverage for small businesses, women's equity issues, portability, pension security and enforcement, and simplification. Those, Mr. President, are the five areas of impact for the legislation that we introduce today. 
I have been honored to participate with some of my colleagues' efforts to build retirement security for American workers. Senator Daschle has created a Democratic pension task force, which led to the introduction of S. 14 on the first day of this session. 
Senators Moseley-Braun, Murray, and Snowe have furthered the debate in helping women achieve a sound retirement, with the Comprehensive Women's Pension Protection Act. 
Senators Conrad and Hatch have focused on clarifying nondiscrimination rules for governmental plans. 
Senator Boxer has fought to protect pension assets from abuse in 401(k) plans. 
Senator Gregg's leadership has guided the Republican pension task force to introduce its pension proposal earlier this week. 
The attention that this issue has received in the Congress highlights its importance to the American people. I am ready to work together and find the common ground that will form the foundation for a secure retirement for millions of Americans. 
We will take a common bipartisan approach that will be necessary for both sides of the aisle, both employers and employees, in order to build that foundation for the future. We need to be able to offer businessowners and their workers uncumbersome portability, administrative simplicity and the confidence that their plans are secure and well funded. 
To be honest, when I first saw the statistics of how many people are ill prepared for retirement, I was amazed. I started asking `Why?' Why do we have over 50 million Americans not prepared for their retirement? I asked Floridians directly. I have spoken with large and small chambers of commerce. 
In my career, I have had the opportunity to spend a workday working directly with the people of our State at more than 300 businesses. I have worked side by side with small business owners, with executives, and their employees. 
My staff, visiting a chamber of commerce in central Florida, recalls the answer given as to why small businesses have few pension plans: `Administrative costs and red tape.' 
When I traveled to Orlando to discuss this bill, I had the arduous task of bringing along the United States Code books and current regulations dealing with pension and retirement. They are overwhelming just by their weight alone. 
Our Nation's small businesses need simple options. They should be focusing on what they do best--growing their businesses, growing our economy, not attempting to apply a pension law that was written 30 or more years ago for large businesses to their current circumstances. It is crucial that we make it as uncomplicated as possible for our Nation's businesses to offer their employees retirement security. 
We need to cut back on paperwork, eliminate obstacles to starting pension plans, streamline the complex regulations, and provide employers with the guidance and support they need to continue their valuable efforts. 
In the end, all of these provisions will encourage employers to offer pension plans because of the lower administrative costs and reduction of red tape. 
Let me mention a few specific ideas which are incorporated in this legislation. 
Small businesses are the most vital sector of today's economy. This is where job growth is, and all indications are where it will accelerate in the future. Yet, small businesses face many challenges in providing a secure retirement for their employees: Higher administrative costs to manage a plan; a fluctuating income stream--some years profits are up; and sometimes they are down--and a lack of resources to keep current with changing laws and regulations. 
This chart demonstrates the problem. Workers in America with a retirement plan: According to the Small Business Administration, if you work for a company that employs 20 or fewer persons, your chances of having a retirement plan are 13 percent; if you work for a firm with between 21 and 100 employees, your chances are 38 percent; if you work for a firm that employs over 500 people, 72 percent of the time you will be covered by a pension and retirement program. 
We need to make it a wise business decision for small businessowners to establish a retirement plan for themselves and for their employees. We need to offer simple creative solutions to expand pension coverage for small businesses. 
Payroll deductions for individual retirement accounts is one example, Mr. President, of the kind of change which is made in this legislation. 
Even with every effort made for simplification, some businesses won't be able to establish a retirement plan. But even the smallest of small businesses can help their employees. Any step we take to facilitate putting money away for retirement is a step in the right direction. 
Payroll deductions are the easiest manner of savings. This provision will facilitate the contributions to IRAs by direct deduction from payrolls. 
Modification of the topheavy rules is another step that will facilitate small businesses providing retirement programs. What are topheavy rules? These are rules which were created to assure that private pension plans were not disproportionately tilted toward highly compensated individuals. These rules affect small businesses much more than large companies. Because topheavy rules are excessively cumbersome, small businesses simply don't offer retirement plans for any of their employees. 
Our provisions attempt to address this inequity by repealing the family aggregation rules and simplifying the definition of key employees and compensation. 
It is important that retirement plans benefit all employees--but, if we can modify these rules to help small family businesses prepare for retirement, millions of Americans would be better off in their retirement years. 
Another area of special concern, Mr. President, in this legislation is the impact that old pension and retirement policies have on women. We know that women are coming into the work force in much larger numbers than they did in previous generations. We know that women are the most mobile component of our work force. They change jobs more frequently. They move 
in and out of the work force as family and other responsibilities dictate. Women tend, during their career, to care for children and aging parents, which makes it difficult for them to stay in one job long enough to secure the benefits that require long periods of employment. 
Statistics show that women will live longer in retirement than men. Therefore, they need more, not less, financial resources for their retirement years. Historically during a career, women will earn less than men, thus making it more difficult for them to save for retirement. The provisions that we include in our women and family equity section help both women and men, but they disproportionately help women. 
Some of the specific concerns women face during their working careers: 
Time away from work for child care, lower salaries, or divorce. 
This section can provide a growing sector of our working population a fair chance at a productive and secure retirement. 
It provides for faster vesting of employers' matching contribution. Under current law, employers may require up to 5 years of service before an employee is entitled to the employer's matching contribution to the business' defined contribution plan. 
Twenty percent of our work force age 45 to 64 have been in their current jobs less than 4 years. That is a huge sector of the work force who are most likely not to stay long enough to vest in their retirement plan. Women are a disproportionate share of that huge portion of the work force. By reducing the vesting period from 5 years to 3 years, we more accurately reflect the changes in our work force. 
Spousal IRA is another example of a provision in the current law which particularly adversely affects women. In an American culture where we see more and more two-career couples, we need to encourage each of them to save in every way possible. 
Under current law, if one spouse is participating in a retirement program at his or her job, no matter how small, the other spouse is precluded from a tax deductible individual retirement account. Senators Roth and Breaux have worked long and hard on this issue, and we have included the results of their efforts in this proposal. It eliminates one barrier that has stood in the way of many two-career families providing for two individuals' pension and retirement security. Individual retirement accounts have proven to be one of the most effective ways to plan for future financial security. Working couples should be encouraged to plan and save through this option. We want to eliminate this barrier to save. 
Another aspect that particularly affects women is the fact that they are subject to periodic discontinuity in their employment careers. 
As the father of four daughters and eight grandchildren, I know all the joy a child can bring a family and how much planning is needed for the new parents to assure that they and their children can provide for their future years. 
Many employees today are taking unpaid leave to spend a few weeks or months with a newborn or a newly adopted child. But by doing so, they may be taking a step away from their own retirement security by not being able to make their usual contributions to their retirement plan. Our provision allows them to do so when they return to the job. 
This proposal is modeled after legislation that Congress adopted after the gulf war in which returning veterans were allowed to make a contribution to their retirement programs to cover the period that they were away from their job serving their Nation. We will help our Nation's new parents in the same way that we helped returning veterans. 
Saving for retirement is not an easy task. It takes dedication month after month. Under this provision, we will make certain that the good savings habits that parents have started can be sustained even if they take time away from work to be with a newborn child. 
Another factor that peculiarly affects women is the issue of portability--the ability to move retirement benefits from one job to the next. 
Just looking at some of the current statistics, we know that the average American worker over the course of a 40-year career will have seven different employers. The average worker in a 40-year career will have seven different employers. Our pension laws were written in an era that didn't anticipate this modern mobility of the work force. 
Americans' retirement dreams can be dimmed by the consequences of moving from job to job. They will have less retirement assets. Often there is no choice but to make a job change. A spouse gets transferred to another city to keep the family together; the other spouse moves as well. We in Congress have been in favor of keeping families together. Let's make certain that the family is not hurt in later years by a difficult retirement, a constrained retirement, because of that very mobility. An employee can be downsized. Companies can go bankrupt. Hard-working recent college graduates can move up the career leader. Each of these involve job changes. 
Mr. President, one of the things that has distinguished the American economy from many other industrialized nations has been this very factor of our mobile work force, that people were willing to move where there were new opportunities, where the changes in the economy dictate that it was to their advantage as well as to the Nation's advantage for people to move from one job to the other. We shouldn't constrain that by imposing a penalty on their long-term retirement security because they have done what is in their interest and what is in the interest of our dynamic economy. 
When such moves occur, we need to mobilize the pension money, to put wheels under it, to make it as portable as the people who will benefit by those retirement savings. Providing employees with a vehicle to take their pension money with them during their working careers will allow the accrual of larger pensions making it easier on the worker and the employers to keep track of retirement funds. 
How can we do this? We can do it through several proposals which are incorporated in the bill that I introduce today. Similar defined contribution plans should be able to roll over one into the other. Money in a retirement stream should be kept there until retirement. When you leave one job for another, your retirement savings should be able to travel with you. 
Mr. President, today American workers have their retirement plans in many different types of specific forms. Well known is the 401(k) plan; also, plans for workers who are employed by nonprofit organizations, workers who are employed by the Government, individual retirement accounts. 
What we provide in our legislation is that, if a worker moves, for instance, from a Government employment to a private employment, they would be able to carry with them their accumulated retirement benefits from their previous plan into their new employment. 
This will require the consent of both the employees and the new employer to do so. But the law will no longer erect arbitrary barriers against such transition of employment benefits. 
All of these plans have their own specific but generally relatively marginal differences. But they all have one common purpose--that is, allowing workers to save for retirement. This ability to move plans as employment history requires a movement will facilitate achieving that objective. 
Mr. President, we also need to encourage businesses to allow their employees to do this. We will eliminate the fear among businesses that by accepting a new employee's previous retirement assets, the business risks the disqualification of its own plan. 
Once a pension plan is in place, Congress needs to assure that the assets are invested wisely and securely. America's workers are depending on the assets that are accumulating in retirement plans. Our laws protecting pension assets need to give them the confidence that they need to rely on these plans in retirement. 
There should be stronger penalties for fraud and embezzlement of plans. We say clearly to the pension fund managers and administrators: If you are guilty of fraud or embezzlement, then your own pension will be at risk. Workers who are hurt by your action will be compensated out of your pension. America's pension fund managers have a sacred trust to millions of employees who will depend on their expertise and skills for a sound retirement. If that trust is broken, harsh sanctions are in order for the guilty party, or managers. 
There should be greater access to information by employees as to what is the status of their pension retirement fund. Pension security will be enhanced by an educated work force. Employees with the necessary information will be able to watch over their own retirement assets. A vital aspect of retirement security is keeping pension participants fully informed of what they have in their plans and what to expect when they retire. 
Senator Grassley is to be commended for his efforts in this area, making sure that employees receive accurate information and properly computed pensions. 
To help employees plan for their retirement, we propose annual benefit statements for all defined contributions plans and every 3 years for defined benefits plans. 
These statements will help all employees plan carefully and would also help to reduce pension miscalculations. We are acting in an anticipatory way to cut off what we think could be a future threat to retirement security. 
Once we have made every effort to keep our Nation's pension assets protected from fraud and abuse, let us protect these assets from ourselves. 
There is already a consumer credit crisis in this country. Millions of American families are overextended, carrying huge balances on multiple credit cards month to month. 
Our measure will prohibit 401(k) or similar retirement assets from being tied to credit cards. If these credit cards were allowed, we would be putting Americans on the slippery slope, spending retirement assets before retiring. 
Mr. President, I mentioned that one of our principal areas of concern is simplification, to make it easier for all the participants in the retirement security process to know, to be in compliance with the standards and therefore to be encouraged to provide more adequately for their retirement. 
Summary plan descriptions and a summary of major modifications will now be substituted for the detailed reporting requirements which are currently required. One less report will be filed. The Department of Labor probably has millions of these current detailed reports stockpiled. 
Under our proposal, the Labor Department retains the right to request one of these reports from a company, but for simplification's sake let us not require the reports to be sent in unless they are actually needed. 
We are also sanctioning the use of electronic communications. Our pension laws should get on the information highway. We have asked the Department of the Treasury to look to the use of e-mail and modern technology in administering pension plans. It is common sense. It is simpler to use. It is less expensive. It will encourage particularly small businesses to provide retirement plans. 
Mr. President, common sense is the foundation of this proposal, to make the punishment for failure to comply with the standards fit the crime. Under current law, the IRS can threaten to disqualify an entire pension plan for inadvertent errors. We are proposing intermediate sanctions, sanctions which are proportionate to the error that has been committed. 
The IRS is to be commended for several programs they have initiated to work with businesses in this area. We want to codify elements of those plans that are already in practice. As an example, a plan should not be disqualified if a company finds and fixes an error prior to an Internal Revenue Service audit. Rank-and-file employees will not be taxed even if a plan is disqualified. 
Senators Hatch and Conrad have led the effort to permanently exclude governmental plans from nondiscriminatory rules. Congress placed a temporary moratorium on those rules in 1977. Since then, we have addressed this issue every few years. After two decades, common sense says let us make this permanent. 
Mr. President, preparing this generation of workers for retirement is, in my view, almost an issue of national security. We know that beginning early in the 21st century there will be a surge of Americans who will reach retirement age. How well prepared those millions of Americans are for the years after retirement will have a significant impact on the economic, personal, and national security of this Nation. A strong economic future depends upon this. 
Mr. President, you represent a State with significant numbers of persons who have chosen to live there in retirement. That is also true of my State of Florida. Every time I go home to my State, I see the result of persons who have conscientiously planned for their retirement--families that have worked hard, invested wisely, saved diligently, and are now enjoying the benefits of retirement in our State. 
Collectively, we Americans could learn a lot from this generation. I want to provide this generation with every possible opportunity to have the same lifestyle as our parents are currently enjoying. To achieve this goal, we need businesses to work together with their employees. We need Republicans and Democrats to collaborate in a bipartisan solution to those inhibitions which are currently resulting in over 50 million Americans not having pension retirement plans. We need to work together to find the common ground and to take steps now on the items upon which we agree. Every time we can make pensions more portable, simpler, fairer to women, more attractive to small businesses, more secure, we are helping every American reach their retirement goal. We are making a significant contribution to a better America.

Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation in conjunction with Senator McCain and 16 of our colleagues to reauthorize the Area Health Education Center Program under title VII of the Public Health Service Act. 
Unfortunately, the law of supply and demand does not always operate to the benefit of rural Americans or the working poor in the health care marketplace. Whether individuals live three counties away from the nearest full-service clinic or just across town, often their access to primary and preventive care is limited. 
While recent attention has focused on controlling run-away health care costs, the problem is not only one of cost, but also one of allocation. We need to allocate both our abundant supply of health professionals and the highly concentrated resources of our world class academic health centers to individuals who are underserved in the health care marketplace. 
Since its inception in 1973, one of the most effective means of redistributing and reallocating manpower has been the Federal and State-funded Area Health Education Centers Program [AHEC]. AHEC's serve as bridges between medical schools and our Nation's underserved rural and inner-city communities, recruiting and training primary care providers and health professionals, and providing continuing education to existing providers. Nine years ago, the AHEC Program was expanded to include the Health Education Training Centers Program [HETC], which are designed to address the persistent unmet health care needs of population groups such as migrants, minorities, and others. 
As Governor of Florida, I became aware of the accomplishments of AHEC's in addressing the maldistribution of health professionals in underserved areas of other southern States such as North Carolina and helped catalyze the initial interest for the development of AHEC's in my State. Since then, I have been pleased to see AHEC's and more recently HETC's grow and flourish throughout Florida and throughout the country. 
Based at each of the State's medical schools, Florida's four AHEC programs now cover all 67 counties in the State. The programs and their 10 affiliated centers conduct activities that address regional and State priorities in areas such as public and school health, recruitment of health professionals to medically underserved communities, and special health needs of migrant and immigrant populations. 
With more than 44 AHEC programs operating in 42 States, we are finally approaching the full evolution of AHEC into a national system with an infrastructure through which to reach those communities and populations in greatest need of basic health services. In 1994, 80 of 142 allopathic and osteopathic medical schools were involved with AHEC and HETC programs nationally, and 13 percent of the Nation's total medical school enrollment obtained community-based training through the program. 
AHEC's effectiveness lies in this unique ability to combine the resources of academic health centers with those of medically underserved communities and in such a way that enhances the 
primary care training while increasing access to care. This role continues to increase in importance as States struggle to adjust to changes in medical reimbursements, limitations on welfare, and cutbacks in social services. 
One of the most important contributions AHEC's have made in Florida and around the Nation is in the training of health professionals in collaboration with local health education institutions, public health departments, community health centers, rural hospitals, local school systems, and volunteer organizations. As a result AHEC's have generated a great deal of academic and community support. During fiscal year 1994, 32 AHEC programs received $22 million in Federal allocations; this was matched by approximately $106 million in State and local funds. These programs have had such success in gaining local and State funds because State legislators and community leaders have witnessed the very real impact and benefits that AHEC's bring to the lives of the people in their States and communities. 
Despite promising health care reforms and increased enrollment in managed care networks, the number of uninsured and underinsured Americans continues to rise. Hundreds of counties throughout the United States are still without doctors, and for many low-income families, whether they be located in the inner-city or a small, rural community, preventive dental care is considered a luxury. 
Because these problems have yet to be resolved, and because AHEC is needed as much today as when it was created, Senator McCain and I are sponsoring this legislation to reauthorize AHEC, as we did successfully in 1992. This reauthorization already enjoys widespread bipartisan support--a testament to the pliable nature of this program in meeting the needs of diverse communities. In their first 25 years, AHEC's around the country have repeatedly shown that the sum total of Federal and State dollars that they have been allocated has been money well spent. We would like to see this successful program extended for 5 more years. 
Thanks to AHEC, the face of health professions education is changing into a more community-centered enterprise that places higher priority on the everyday needs of all Americans, including those who historically have been underserved. While we have already begun to see the results of this change, many challenges lie ahead in the ongoing effort to ensure access to health care for all Americans. With the contribution of AHEC, our communities and academic health centers will have the means necessary to work together and meet those challenges.

Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today in support of Senate Concurrent Resolution 21 of which I am a proud cosponsor. This resolution congratulates the residents of Jerusalem and the people of Israel on the 30th anniversary of the reunification of that historic city. This resolution also expresses our strong belief that Jerusalem must remain an undivided city in which the rights of every ethnic and religious group are protected as they have been by Israel during the past 30 years. Furthermore it calls upon the President and the Secretary of State to publicly affirm as a matter of United States policy that Jerusalem must remain the undivided capital of the State of Israel. 
There has been a continuous Jewish presence in Jerusalem for three millennia and a Jewish majority in the city for the past 150 years. Jerusalem has been, throughout these years, the holiest of cities and the focal point of Jewish devotion. Jerusalem remains a unique and critically important city to the Jewish people. Jerusalem is also the only city in the world which serves as the capital of the same country, inhabited by the same people, speaking the same language, and worshipping the same God as was the case 3,000 years ago. 
During the 1948 Arab-Israeli War, the Jewish people were driven out of the Old City of Jerusalem and denied access to holy sites in the area controlled by Jordan. For 19 years Israelis of all faiths and Jews from all around the world were prevented from visiting their holiest sites by the barbed wire which divided Jerusalem. Today we commemorate 30 years of unrestricted access to these holy sites. Since the Israeli Government reunified Jerusalem under its control, the rights of all religious and ethnic groups have been restored and vigilantly protected. 
The protection of the rights of every ethnic and religious group is critical to the maintenance of peace in such a diverse and religiously significant region. We are here today to commend the Israeli people and their government for restoring full access for all people to their holy sites. Today we again lend our support to continued Israeli control of a unified Jerusalem. 
Support for a strong, independent, and undivided Israel is the keystone of our policy in the Middle East. Israel is not only the sole democracy in the region, but also a country with which we share cultural and historical ties. Our continued support of Israel, and of Jerusalem as its undivided capital, is especially important in this crucial point in the peace process. 
We are here today in continuation of our previous policy initiatives regarding Israel and its control of Jerusalem. In 1990, the Congress adopted concurrent resolutions declaring that the Congress `strongly believes that Jerusalem must remain an undivided city in which the rights of every ethnic religious group are protected.' In 1992, the Congress adopted resolutions to commemorate the 25th anniversary of the reunification of Jerusalem, additionally reaffirming congressional sentiment that Jerusalem must remain an undivided city. 
Congress' most forceful and symbolically consequential actions in recognition of the importance of a unified Jerusalem have been part of its systematic rebuke of its previous policy of maintaining the U.S. Embassy in Tel Aviv. For some time the United States has conducted its official meetings and other business in the city of Jerusalem in de facto recognition of its status as the capital of Israel. The Jerusalem Embassy Act of 1995 stated as a matter of policy that Jerusalem should remain the undivided capital of Israel. Funds for the building of the U.S. Embassy in Jerusalem were recently appropriated in the fiscal year 1998 appropriations bill, H.R. 1486. 
As a Member of this Senate and a long-time supporter of Israel, I am proud to stand with many of my distinguished colleagues as a cosponsor of this important resolution.

Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today, and join my colleagues, Senator Mack and Senator Baucus, to introduce timely legislation that addresses a problem that continues to plague the Medicare Program--fraud and abuse. The premise of this bill is quite simple: if Congress is to look for cuts in the Medicare Program, it should begin with eradicating fraud--for several reasons: 
First, we cannot fix Medicare while letting fraud erode the system. The General Accounting Office estimates that the Medicare waste, fraud, and abuse ripoff rate is about 10 percent. With fraud pilfering the health system's resources losses to Medicare and the Federal share of Medicaid could be $30 billion annually. Using the most conservative of estimates, we could cover an additional 2 million seniors a year with funds lost just to Medicare waste, fraud, and abuse. 
Mr. President, over the next few weeks, Congress will be ironing out the details of a historic budget agreement--one which will finally balance the budget. And both Congress and the President deserve credit for doing so. However, a balanced budget does not come without some pain--some consequences. For instance, the Medicare Program will realize cuts of approximately $115 billion over the next 5 years. We will be asking our Nation's seniors to share in the sacrifice along with the rest of the country. 
Congress cannot, in good conscience, ask the Medicare Program and its beneficiaries to accept cuts unless we also work hard to eradicate fraud and abuse. Passage of the Kennedy-Kassebaum legislation last year was a step in the right direction. But the cheats and swindlers are clever at gaming the system. It is a sad fact that there will always be greedy 
people looking to take advantage of our Nation's seniors. So it is imperative that Congress be equally vigilant by cracking down on fraud wherever possible. Passage of my bill will continue the process and send this signal to the con artists and thieves: `Your days are numbered.' 
My legislation is crafted to build on State successes. For instance, one of the most crucial provisions in my bill, modeled after an extremely successful Florida Medicaid antifraud program, requires providers of durable medical equipment, home health, and transportation services to post a $50,000 surety bond to participate in the Medicare Program. 
While a $50,000 bond is relatively inexpensive to post for scrupulous contractors, at the cost of between $500 and $1,500, the requirement has achieved tremendous results in my State. Since implementation of the surety bond requirement, the fly-by-night providers have scattered like so many roaches when the lights are turned on. 
Durable medical equipment suppliers have dropped by 62 percent, from 4,146 to 1,565; home health agencies have decreased by 41 percent, from 738 to 441; providers of transportation services have disenrolled from the State's Medicaid Programs in droves--from 1,759 to 742, a drop of 58 percent. Fewer providers bilking the State's Medicaid Program is projected to save over $192 million over the next 2 years in Florida. 
Two years ago I spent a day working in the U.S. attorney's Office in south Florida. I realized then that it was easier to get a provider number under Medicare than a personal VISA; easier to get a blank check paid for by the Treasury than a VISA or MasterCard. 
This bill requires individuals to provide their social security number [SSN] and employer identification number [EIN] to get a Medicare provider number. This will make it more difficult for swindlers to enter the program. This bill has several other provisions which are critical to stemming rampant fraud in the Medicare Program: 
My bill would enable State fraud control units, often the first line in the fight against health care fraud, to investigate and prosecute fraud in Federal health care programs. 
It would also prevent providers from discharging Medicare debt by declaring bankruptcy. The bill would also preclude Medicare swindlers from transferring their business to a family member in order to circumvent exclusion from the Medicare Program. 
This legislation enacts a broad-based Federal statute aimed at suppressing Medicare fraud. It enhances the arsenal of weapons to combat fraud and prescribes stiff penalties against those convicted of fraud. 
At the signing of the Medicare bill in Missouri 30 years ago, President Johnson said that Medicare had been planted with `the seed of compassion and duty which have today flowered into care for the sick and serenity for the fearful.' Medicare has lived up to its promise. But fraud is threatening to compromise the integrity of the system. We have the prescriptions to combat fraud. Now is the time to employ them if we want to save the integrity of Medicare.

Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, today I introduce the Principal Residence Tax Exclusion Act of 1997. Earlier this year, Representatives Rob Portman and Ben Cardin introduced similar legislation, styled H.R. 1391, in the House of Representatives. In addition, both President Clinton and former Senator Dole have expressed strong support for a capital gains exclusion for our Nation's homeowners. 
This is a proposal that enjoys widespread bipartisan support. Now is the time to make good on our promises to help our Nation's families. 
As everyone knows, moving is a stressful and complicated process. Besides worrying about whether to take advantage of a job opportunity in another State or to move closer to family members or to accept some other reason for relocation, such as a change of residence at retirement, people should not have added to all of those complex decisions the worry about paying taxes on the sale of their permanent residence. 
This act will get the tax code out of the family's decisionmaking process. It will allow the family to make decisions based on the family's specific circumstances, not based on constraints imposed by the tax law. 
What is the current law? Under the current law, capital gains from the sale of principal residences are subject to taxation. However, two provisions exclude many homeowners from the effect of that taxation. 
First, under the so-called rollover provision, taxpayers can roll over gains from the sale of a principal residence into a new residence and defer any capital gains tax under certain conditions. One of those is that the purchase price of the new residence must exceed the adjusted sales price of the previous principal residence. The new residence must be purchased within 2 years of the date of sale of the first home. 
There is a second provision which results in many homeowners not paying a capital gains tax on a principal residence. And that is the age 55 exclusion, a taxpayer is eligible for a one-time permanent exclusion of up to $125,000 on any accumulated gain from the sale of their principal residence. In addition to meeting the age 55 requirement to qualify for this exclusion, the taxpayer must have owned the residence and used it as their principal residence for at least 3 years during the 5 years prior to the sale. 
A taxpayer is eligible for the exclusion only if neither the taxpayer nor the taxpayer's spouse has previously benefited from this exclusion. Consequently, Mr. President, to avoid the tax, most people wait until they are eligible for the one-time exclusion or they make what may be uneconomic decisions regarding the sale of their home. 
Mr. President, this is not right. People should be able to move when they want to, not when the tax code makes it financially possible. They should be able to buy a smaller home, if that is what they desire, without having to pay a tax on the difference between their profit on the sale of the first home and the price of the new home. 
Mr. President, this is an issue of removing governmental intrusion from family matters. This is an issue of allowing Americans to be free from unnecessarily burdensome requirements. This is an issue of permitting people to make decisions that will ultimately have a positive impact on the American economy. 
The Principal Residence Tax Exclusion Act would go a long way toward resolving each of these issues. I hope that my colleagues will join me in supporting this proposal. 
Under this act, the Principal Residence Tax Exclusion Act, taxpayers of any age--I underscore `any age'--could exclude the gain on the sale of a principal residence of up to $500,000 for a married couple filing a joint return, and up to $250,000 for a single taxpayer. 
To be eligible, the taxpayer must have owned and used the home as the principal residence for at least 2 of the last 5 years prior to the sale. The exclusion will generally be available once every 2 years. 
This legislation would have a far-reaching impact on the families of our Nation. Under the current law, approximately 150,000 families annually have taxable gain on the sale of their homes. This number would be even higher. However, concern about the tax causes most people to wait until they are eligible for the one-time exclusion or to buy increasingly more expensive homes over time regardless of whether such purchases are economically wise or otherwise meet the family's needs. 
Under the new proposal, the Department of the Treasury estimates that only about 10,000 transactions annually would be subject to taxation. So nearly all families would be relieved of the burdensome recordkeeping requirements and constraints on decisionmaking which are part of the current law. 
Mr. President, I would like to bring to your attention one such family, a family who I believe represents the concerns of many American families. Rudy and Lynn Saumell of Valrico, FL, retired and moved to Florida several years ago after working for a combined total of 60 years in the Connecticut school system. Lynn taught remedial math in the elementary school for 25 years. Rudy taught for 15 years before serving as an assistant principal for 20 more years. The Saumells lived in their Connecticut home with their two daughters for 23 years. When the Saumells retired 5 years ago, their girls had long since left home; the family's needs had changed. 
Lynn and Rudy decided to move to Florida to be near some of their relatives and to enjoy the warm climate and a hospitable neighborhood. They no longer needed such a large home. They were moving to a lower cost area. But the Saumells were concerned about being taxed on the sale of their Connecticut home. So, upon their accountant's advice, they bought a more expensive home than they needed and used both the one-time exclusion and the rollover provision to avoid paying tax on their previous residence's sale. 
In order to qualify under current law, the Saumells had to keep extensive records of all of the improvements they made to their previous residence. For over two decades, they complied with the law to the best of their abilities despite the difficulties they encountered in doing so. 
I commend the Saumells for their diligence. I agree with them that these requirements seem unnecessarily burdensome and nearly impossible to fulfill without error, omission, or honest misunderstanding. 
The act I propose would eliminate the need to keep these detailed records for 99 percent-plus of all Americans. After spending 5 years in their new home, the Saumells still want to move to a smaller home in a retirement community. They are paying more than they would like in property taxes. Their heat, water, and electric bills would be greatly reduced. Instead, Rudy and Lynn would rather spend the money they have saved for traveling and helping their daughters buy homes for their new families. Lynn and Rudy do not need such a big home for just the two of them. 
But the Saumells are stuck between a rock and a hard place. Under the current law, if they keep their house they will not be able to spend their savings as they would like. But if they sell their home and buy a less expensive one, they cannot use the over-55 exemption again since it is only available once in a lifetime and the rollover provision would not apply since they are not moving to a more expensive home. 
Thus their savings would be eaten up by a large capital gains tax, defeating the purpose of selling their current residence. So they are locked in the dilemma: Do we stay in a home that is larger than we need, more expensive than we can afford, or do we sell the home and suffer a substantial capital gains tax? 
Mr. President, why should the Saumells have to base their housing decisions on the Tax Code rather than their family requirements? Why should they be prevented from spending their savings on what they deem to be important? 
Like many Americans who are affected by the capital gains tax on home sales, Rudy and Lynn have spent their entire lives working and saving for their retirement and to assist their daughters in starting their new families' lives. It is unfair to deny them the freedom to spend these savings as they wish. So I offer this legislation to allow the Saumells and all of our Nation's families more freedom in their decisionmaking, to be able to decide where to live based on their families' circumstances, not on the Tax Code. 
Rudy now volunteers with a local television station to help people recover money that has been wrongfully withheld from them. Isn't it time that we remove the Tax Code restraints on Rudy and help him get back the free use of his own money? 
Mr. President, we have the means, the opportunity, and the support to help our Nation's families in a very significant way. Passing this legislation is more than providing relief to our Nation's homeowners. It is the right thing to do.

Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I join all those in America who are concerned about filling judicial vacancies in expressing gratitude to Senators Hatch and Leahy for bringing judicial nominations to the floor for our timely consideration. 
Florida, with some of the busiest districts in the Nation, has three Federal judicial vacancies. With our action today, one of those vacancies is no more, and the people of Florida's southern district will soon be served by an outstanding and experienced member of both the legal and larger south Florida community--Mr. Don Middlebrooks. 
I look forward to working with my colleagues to fill all of the judicial vacancies in Florida. But today's action is a very positive step forward. 
Mr. President, the people served by the jurists we confirm have a right to expect judges who bring unquestioned competence, strong integrity, devotion to duty, and diversity of experience with them to the Federal bench. 
Throughout his career--as an undergraduate and law student at the University of Florida, a public servant, and a distinguished member of the south Florida legal community--Don Middlebrooks has met--and exceeded--this standard of excellence time and time again. 
Mr. Middlebrooks started his career in the public service at the University of Florida, where his fellow undergraduates elected him president of the student body. 
That excellence in student government was followed by distinction at the University of Florida Law School and, eventually, outstanding service in the Florida State government. 
In 1974, Don Middlebrooks was asked to serve the people of Florida as assistant general counsel to then-Governor Reubin Askew. He served with such distinction that Governor Askew ultimately elevated him to the post of general counsel. 
Three years later, as Governor Askew's second and final term was coming to a close, Mr. Middlebrooks left Tallahassee and joined the south Florida offices of Steel, Hector, & Davis, one of our State's oldest and largest law firms. 
His 20 years of experience with highly complex legal issues makes him especially well-prepared for the cases that he will see as a Federal district court judge in south Florida. 
But the fact that Don Middlebrooks has spent the last two decades in the private sector does not mean that he has neglected his commitment to public service. 
In addition to handling numerous pro bono cases himself, Mr. Middlebrooks was chairman of Steel, Hector, & Davis' public service committee when the firm received the American Bar Association pro bono award and the Florida Supreme Court chief justice's law firm commendation. 
He has also been a civic leader. The list of his involvements is long and distinguished--chairman of the Palm Beach County Criminal Justice Commission, president of the Florida Bar Association, member of the Florida Ethics Commission. 
Perhaps Don Middlebrooks' most important civic contribution has been his tireless commitment to the welfare of Florida's youngest generation--its children. 
In addition to being the father of 11-year-old Amanda and 9-year-old Jack, Mr. Middlebrooks has served as chairman of the Palm Beach County Children's Services Council, chairman of the Florida Bar Commission for Children, and a member of the Florida Commission on Child Welfare. 
Mr. Chairman, throughout his life, Don Middlebrooks has been respected by his peers, hailed for his outstanding service to the people of Florida, honored for his civic involvements, and praised for his skill and competence in the legal arena. 
I have no doubt that this pattern of distinction and outstanding service will continue once he is invested as a Federal judge in the southern district of Florida.

Mr. GRAHAM. Thank you. 
Mr. President, I appreciate this opportunity to rise on behalf of the amendment that is being offered by our distinguished colleague from Illinois. 
Frankly, my own criticism of her proposal is that I think it is too modest in relationship to the challenge that we face as a Nation. As she has pointed out, our own General Accounting Office has indicated that there is a need in this Nation to bring existing schools up to a standard of basic safety, health, and educational adequacy of over $100 billion. What is not included in that number, Mr. President, is what is required to build the new classrooms for the exploding student population. 
If I could use my own State as an example, Mr. President. Last year we had over 55,000 new students enrolled at the public schools in the State of Florida. That number will continue, in terms of angle rate of growth, for the foreseeable future. 
Similar numbers are true in States across America, as the baby boom population is now having babies and those babies are reaching school age. So we have a crisis not only in terms of rebuilding our older schools, but also in assuring new schools in order to avoid overcrowded classrooms. 
If I could tell a personal story, my own daughter was a kindergarten teacher in Dade County, FL. Her last year teaching in a brand new elementary school she had 38 5-year-olds in her kindergarten class. My daughter is a wonderful teacher. I would defy anyone to truly educate 38 5-year-olds in one classroom. 
I might say, she went on from that experience. She was married, she taught for a brief period in Virginia, and now is a mother. In fact she is not only a mother, she is a mother of triplets. And so she said she was the only mother of triplets who ended up with 35 fewer children to deal with. 
Mr. President, that personal story underscores what is happening in too many classrooms to too many of our young Americans. And that is, that because we have fallen so woefully behind in maintenance as well as new construction, we are not providing the educational facilities that students need. 
The question is asked, `Well, that's a State and local responsibility. Why are you here in Washington talking about this? You, a former State legislator, a former Governor, you certainly understand where the responsibility for education lies.' Absolutely. 
I would defend the right and the importance of maintaining our tradition that States and local communities especially be responsible for those things that happen inside the classroom, curriculum, personnel policy, teacher relationships. But, Mr. President, there is a role for the Federal Government in the physical facilities of schools. 
We have demonstrated this for a long time in higher education. There is probably not a major college or university in America that 
cannot point to a substantial number of its physical facilities having been built with totally or in part Federal funds. We have recognized that distinction of concrete and steel from what happens inside the classroom and the appropriateness of a Federal role in meeting those facilities challenges. 
If we are serious about the proposition that the key to a competitive America in the 21st century is going to be how well our Americans are educated, and how well they will be able to compete in the increasingly globalized economy, certainly the Federal Government has a role in seeing that the physical places in which that preparation is going to take place meet acceptable standards. They do not meet those standards in too many communities in America today. 
And we, Mr. President, are about to exacerbate that situation. One of the reasons that we have 55,000-plus new students in the Florida public schools is because of Federal immigration policy. 
The Federal Government has adopted policies which have resulted in tens of thousands of young people who were not born in the United States now being in the United States and being educated in our public schools. I think the Federal Government has a moral responsibility to assist when it is the precipitator of a significant amount of the challenge that school districts face. 
We are about to consider some substantial enhancements in the opportunity for young people to go to college through credits and deductions toward that tuition. Mr. President, that could have a significant effect on college tuition. 
I have a letter from the Assistant Deputy Secretary of the Treasury which indicates that the estimate of enrollment which will increase substantially in higher education as a result of the proposal for credits and deductions for college tuition is between 120,000 and 1.4 million. So we are about to consider a proposal which has the potential not only of creating a substantial surge in additional enrollment in higher education but would have a spillover effect in terms of the number of students and the kinds of educational opportunities that would be expected, particularly within our secondary schools. 
Mr. President, the Federal Government has a second responsibility because we are a significant part of the policies which are causing the demands that are occurring on the physical facilities of our public schools. 
Finally, one of the reasons that the reports are as dire as the General Accounting Office report states is so many States and local school districts are against the wall in their capacity to finance the maintenance of their schools and new construction. It has not been people at the local level that are indefinite, it is not that they are blind to the problem, it is that they are in many cases out of options as to how to deal with the problem, either because of statutory or economic limitations. 
I believe there is an appropriate Federal role to be a partner, and I underscore the word partner, with States and local school districts in meeting their school construction needs. This proposal is a beginning toward that new very important relationship. 
I commend the Senator from Illinois for her leadership in this matter. I hope her voice will be heard by our colleagues. I can tell you it is being heard out in America. They understand the importance of this issue. They understand the need to have Washington respond in a meaningful and tangible way. The question is whether we hear those voices here in this Chamber.

Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, this has been an illuminating discussion to an admittedly complex question. So, without being redundant, I will step back to see if we can sort out what are the issues in agreement and what are the issues upon which we disagree. 
One area in which there is agreement, agreement both in the underlying supplemental appropriations bill and in the amendment that is offered by my colleague from Virginia, myself, and others, is that the $139 million, which was an admitted error of arithmetic basis in the Department of the Treasury, should be corrected. 
There are States which received less funds than they should have received because of that admitted error. I think there is virtual unanimous agreement that we should correct that error. We will do so. Whichever position we take on this amendment, $139 million will flow to those States which were the object of that inadvertent omission. 
The second question upon which there is agreement is that the total funds for surface transportation should be increased in this supplemental appropriations bill beyond the $139 million, and there is basic agreement that the amount of that increase should be approximately $800 million. Both the underlying bill and the amendment provide for the allocation of an additional $800 million beyond the $139 million necessary to correct the error. 
The issue becomes how that $800 million should be structured and what is the rationale for the $800 million. A portion of that $800 million, roughly $318 million, represents those States which had been given an expectation of what they would have received--a false expectation, based on that arithmetic error and acted upon that expectation. They thought they were going to get an additional $4 or $5 million because of the arithmetic error, and they calculated that into their State highway fund. 
Question: Should the Federal Government, even though it was in error, it was a false expectation, but it was a communicated expectation and it was an expectation upon which the States took action, be responsible for those funds? I think that is a debatable issue. 
The third portion of this debate has to do with the remaining $475 million. Let me say at this point--and I mean no disrespect to any comments made thus far--this has absolutely nothing to do with the issue of the arithmetic error. I repeat that it has nothing to do with the issue of the arithmetic error. I cite as my authority for that, first, the supplemental appropriations bill itself, on page 39, lines 12 through 18, which clearly outline that the purpose of these funds is, notwithstanding any other provisions of law, such additional authority shall be distributed to assure that no State shall receive an amount in fiscal year 1997 that is less than the amount they received in 1996. 
That doesn't have anything to do with an arithmetic error. That has to do with providing a hold-harmless provision in this supplemental appropriations bill, which was not provided in the ISTEA Act of 1991. 
Mr. President, if we could briefly go back to that legislation, that legislation contained the allocation of some $120 billion of Federal funds to the States and territories for surface transportation. It was a very contentious bill, as all of these bills tend to be. It contained a provision for those States that had traditionally received back substantially less than they had contributed to the highway funds, that in the last year of the 6 years of ISTEA authorization, which is fiscal year 1997, there would be inserted a 90-percent floor--that is, that no State, in the last year of the 6 years of ISTEA, would get back less than 90 percent of what it contributed to the highway fund. That 90 percent standard had been the holy grail of those States that had, in the past, gotten back substantially less than 90 percent. 
We had attempted, frankly, to get that standard applied in every year of the 1991 ISTEA bill. But politically unable to do that, the compromise was that, in the last year, that objective would be achieved. Since we are dealing with a zero-sum amount of money--that is, there is a fixed amount of money to be distributed in 1997, obviously some States had to get less in 1997 than they got in 1996 in order for other States to be brought up to this 90-percent floor. That was understood, that was part of the negotiation, that was part of the common understanding of the Congress and President Bush when he signed this legislation in 1991. 
That is the issue that the $475 million goes to. It has nothing to do with the arithmetic error made in the Department of the Treasury. What this $475 million essentially says is that we are going to pour $475 million of additional Federal money, beyond that which had been contemplated in 1991, into the ISTEA program and specifically into a policy that will assure that, regardless of what the law said that we passed in 1991, we are going to guarantee that we are not playing with a zero-sum game, because no State will get less in 1997 than the State received in 1996. 
Now, that is the issue that this amendment raises. What this amendment says is that if we are going to provide these additional funds beyond that which is required to correct the arithmetic error, we should be faithful to the law that we passed in 1991 and we should distribute that money under the provisions of the law that is already the law of the land and will govern the distribution of highway funds in 1991. 
Mr. President, I believe that is an extremely important and clarion call for fundamental fairness. We had this debate in 1991. We decided on the compromise, which is the essence of the congressional process, that a 90-percent floor concept would be 
available, but only in the last year. Now, in the last hours of the life of ISTEA, we are about to vitiate that understanding. It is fair because those States which have traditionally been substantially donor States--that is, they sent more money to Washington than they got back--this represents an opportunity--we are not going to say that all States are going to get 100 percent of their money; we are going to say that no State will get less than 90-percent of its money. 
Now, frankly, Mr. President, I do not support the principle that all States should get 100 percent, because I recognize exactly what the Senator from Alaska is saying. We are dealing with a national surface transportation system, and there are rational reasons why some States, such as the very large geographic areas, get a certain amount. The small-population State of Alaska should get back more than other States in order to be able to maintain an equivalent level of their contribution to a National Highway System. But that was the essence of the debate that we had in 1991, and we came to this resolution that we should establish, in the last year of the 6-year authorization, this principle of a 90-percent floor. That principle is about to be violated by pouring $475 million into this program in its final weeks of existence in order to assure that no State will get less than it got in 1996. 
So, Mr. President, for fundamental fairness to the Nation, to the fundamental credibility of this very important program of Federal-State partnership for the mobility needs of America, I urge that we adopt the amendment that has been offered by the Senator from Virginia, that we focus on the issue that this amendment raises, which is not an issue of arithmetic perfection, it is an issue of fairness protection. We arrived at how these funds should be allocated. We should stick with the agreement that we have. We should not, in a supplemental appropriations bill, on May 8, attempt to change it. So, Mr. President, I urge adoption of the amendment offered, and I commend my colleague from Virginia for the leadership provided.

Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, again let us sort out what we are considering here. 
First, we have what is an admitted arithmetical error by the Department of Treasury. We are attempting to correct that error. There is no dispute between those who advocate the Warner-Graham amendment and those who are proposing the language in the underlying bill that we should correct that error. What is happening now is that because of that error, that mistake, we are now trying to change the fundamental law that relates to the allocation of surface transportation funds among the States. 
It would be as if a person had been involved in an automobile accident and had suffered significant injuries and received an insurance payment to make that person whole again, to repay them, reimburse them for the injuries, the medical bills, the lost wages and the other damages that they had suffered, and then their neighbor would turn and say, well, we ought to get the same bill so that we can maintain parity with our neighbor who has gotten this cash settlement from his or her insurance company. 
The States that were the losers, that were adversely affected by this arithmetic error are not getting any windfall. They are just like that person involved in the accident. They are being made whole. They are not getting a dime more than they were entitled to get or that they would have gotten under the ISTEA legislation had it been properly administered at every stage. 
They are being made whole, for an error that was made and was beyond the capacity of the States to control. That is just fundamental fairness. They are not getting anything that is a benefit beyond what they were entitled to. That is the first $139 million. 
Now we are looking at the second $800 million that is being distributed under this proposal, which relates to how everybody else, the States that were not adversely affected, are going to be treated under this law. Senator Warner and I recommend a simple standard. If we are going to decide that additional highway money should be provided beyond that which is required to rectify this error, it ought to be distributed pursuant to the law. We passed a law in 1991 that set up a method of allocating funds among the 50 States and territories. That law ought to be abided by. 
There was reference made by some of the previous speakers that by applying the Warner-Graham standard, some States were going to get zero. No State will get zero. Every State will participate in the $800 million, exactly as the law that we passed in 1991 provides they should. Every State will get a significant amount of additional highway funds beyond what they are presently contemplating. Every State will be a winner. 
The question is, are they going to be a winner under the rules that we adopted through the process of this Senate--an authorization committee holding extensive hearings, reporting out a bill, that bill being debated for days and days on the Senate floor, finally going to a conference committee and a product that the President of the United States signed into law? Are we going to respect that process and use that as the means of distributing this additional $800 million? Or, are we, at the last gasp of the 1991 legislation, to say, `No, we don't want to do that; we want to use a different formula, and that formula is going to say that we are going to hold a set of States harmless by pouring additional money into those States,' in effect undoing the underlying law that was passed through the congressional process of this Senate and House of Representatives with the concurrence of the President? 
There is an issue of fundamental fairness here. A number of States for many years have been contributing substantially more to the National Highway System than they were receiving back. As I said earlier, there are rationales for that that I can accept, recognizing that all States do not have the same capacity, they do not have the same geography, the same population, in order to support a National Highway System. The States that are the donor States are not asking to get back 100 percent, but they are saying, in the last year, in the 6th year of a 6-year highway bill, we ought to at least get back 90 percent. 
That is what we agreed to. That is the deal that was made. That is what I think should be honored. That is what fundamental fairness calls for. That is what we achieve by the adoption of the Warner-Graham amendment.

 Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, today I would like to recognize and congratulate a group of outstanding citizens from Broward County. These men and women have each given a great gift to their communities--they have given of themselves. 
Samuel Bonier, of Sunrise, has spent the last 4 years volunteering at the Daniel D. Cantor Senior Center. His activities include serving as an assistant bookkeeper, mail clerk and needed friend to the center's residents. Samuel is also concerned about the community's children and has donated his time to help feed and bathe children in the Ann Storch Center. For his selfless actions Samuel was awarded the Volunteer of the Month Award in 1994 by the Cantor Center. 
Pearl Canady, of Fort Lauderdale, imparted her wisdom to countless students as a teacher for over 30 years in the Broward County School System. Pearl continues to serve her community as a member of the Area Agency on Aging's Advisory Council. Pearl's generous spirit has enhanced the lives of many. 
Daniel D. Cantor, of Tamarac, is one of Broward County's leading Jewish community leaders. Daniel has been active in countless Jewish organizations, including the Jewish National Fund, Israel Bonds and United Jewish Appeal. He was indispensable in the campaign to help resettle Russian Jewry in Israel and in the United States. 
Marie Antoinette Capazzi, of Plantation, has served as Social Director for the Senior Club of Plantation for over 20 years. Marie has also worked with the Red Cross distributing food to the needy. Because of her service to the community, May 11, 1983 was declared Marie Capazzi day by the city of Plantation. Marie was also acknowledged as 1996 Citizen of the Year by the Plantation Elks Club. 
Chris Franklin, of Pompano Beach, has been a tireless advocate for the elderly. Chris has been extremely active with the Florida Silver-Haired Legislature to insure that the rights of the elderly are protected. Later this year Chris will be a delegate to the National Congress of Silver-Hairs. 
Rickey Pine Garber, of Tamarac, works to improve relations between seniors and the police. She is involved in several organizations including Seniors and Lawmen Together and the Citizens Observation Patrol. Rickey also works with the Area Agency on Aging assisting both seniors and the young who are experiencing financial and social distress. 
Nat Geier, of Sunrise, volunteers his time to several organizations throughout Broward County. As a result of his efforts in the Area Agency's Seniors for Seniors Dollar Drive, Nat has raised over $700 every year. In addition, Nat was instrumental in securing the first computers for Piper High School and Village Elementary. 
David J. Mears, of Coral Springs, was instrumental in the founding of the city of Margate. David has been called the founding father of Margate because of his active role in developing the eastern section of the city. He has served as honorary mayor of Margate and is presently president of the Gold Coast Chapter of the National Association of Industrial and Office Parks. 
Angelo Quatrociocchi, of Cooper City, is an active volunteer at Memorial Manor, a residential home for seniors. His activities include transporting residents to activities, assisting with meals, and playing his accordion and harmonica for the residents. Angelo continued to volunteer even after his wife, Josephine, died. His commitment to the community is unwavering. 
Herman Small, of Hallandale, is an advocate for the community's elderly. For the past 10 years, Herman has been developing fundraising concepts for the Area Agency on Agency. Herman also educates the community's elderly on legislation that directly affects them. 
Bertha Walker, a resident of Broward County for over 50 years, devotes her time to improving the community. She chaperoned local students on field trips and has been recognized by the YMCA for her dedication to the community's youth. Her contributions to the area's youth are appreciated by all. 
Benjamin Wermiel, of Coconut Creek, has been contributing his time and energy to the community for 15 years. As secretary of the elderly interest fund, Benjamin raised $400,000 for the organization's Medivan Program. Benjamin is also the Broward coalition's representative to the Florida Health Care Campaign which seeks to provide universal health care to all Floridians. Benjamin has improved the lives of many residents in Broward County. 
Florida and Broward County are fortunate to have these inspiring senior citizens who give so much to their communities. I congratulate them today and wish for them many more productive and healthy years.

Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, today I have the distinct pleasure to introduce legislation that would redesignate the Old Federal Courthouse in Miami, FL, the `David W. Dyer Federal Courthouse.' 
Residing behind the bench for over 30 years, Judge Dyer distinguished himself as one of the finest jurists in the State of Florida, and his commitment to public service dates back to his service in the U.S. Army during World War II. 
In 1961, President John F. Kennedy appointed him to the District Court for the Southern District of Florida. At the time the Southern District included Tampa, Jacksonville, and Miami. The following year the district was pared down and he became the initial chief judge of the reconfigured Southern District. Judge Dyer would continue to serve in this capacity for the next 4 years. 
President Lyndon Johnson then appointed him to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit in 1966. This marked the first time that anyone from Miami had been honored with the opportunity to serve on the court of appeals. In 1977, Judge Dyer rose to the position of senior judge for the fifth circuit and carried this status over into the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals. 
During the turbulent 1960's, Judge Dyer participated in a number of civil rights cases. This period was an era when the Federal courts were called to implement the constitutional ideal of equal justice under the law for all Americans. It was a proud time in our legal history and Judge Dyer is part of that legacy. In one such case, he was responsible for the desegregation of the restaurants on the Florida Turnpike. 
Judge Dyer served his community in a variety of other capacities. He is a former member of the board of governors and executive committee of the Florida Bar, as well as the board of governors of the Maritime Law Association. He also served as president of the Dade County Bar, the largest in Florida. 
Judge Dyer has been an inspirational model for two generations of lawyers. He has shown through his example what integrity of character, sound judgment, and courage of conviction can achieve in implementing our highest ideals. 
Mr. President, Judge Dyer spent much of his life working out of the Old Federal Courthouse in Miami. Passage of this legislation to redesignate the building in Judge Dyer's name would be a small, but fitting token of appreciation that America and its judicial system owe Judge Dyer for his years of distinguished service. I urge my colleagues to support me in enacting this measure.

Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I wish to speak this afternoon about an initiative which has been designed to increase American's access to college education. Today, Senator McConnell and I, along with numerous cosponsors, are introducing the College Savings Act of 1997. This bill would clarify the tax treatment of State-sponsored prepaid college tuition and savings programs and would clarify them in a manner that will allow States flexibility to offer their citizens plans to pay for college on a tax-free basis. 
Why are we discussing these programs? We are discussing these State programs because they have flourished in the face of spiraling college costs. As shown on this chart, which was produced by the General Accounting Office, tuition at colleges and universities has increased 234 percent since 1980. During the same period, the general rate of inflation has increased only 85 percent and household income has increased only 82 percent. There has been a growing gap between the cost of higher education, in terms of tuition, and the ability of families to support their children's desire to continue their education beyond high school. 
Higher education inflation has been almost triple the rate of general inflation and the increase in Americans' ability to pay for that higher education. The causes of this dramatic increase in tuition is the subject of a significant debate. But whether these increases are attributable to increased costs of colleges and universities, reduction in State funding for public institutions, or the increased value of a college education, the fact remains that affording a college education has become increasingly difficult for American families. 
Although the Federal Government has increased its aid to college students over the years, it is the States that have engineered innovative ways to help citizens afford college. 
One of the most innovative of those measures has been the prepaid college tuition plan. The first of these plans was adopted in Michigan in 1986. Since that first program was adopted, today 15 States have such prepaid college plans, and an additional 4 States have adopted plans which will be in effect by 1998. 
The States shown in green are those which currently offer plans. The four States shown in yellow will initiate their plans this year. All of the remaining States shown in red are currently considering legislation to establish a prepaid college tuition plan. From these State laboratories, two types of programs have emerged: prepaid tuition programs and savings programs. 
Under either of these two, a family pays money into a State fund. In future years, the funds which have been accumulating will be distributed to the college or university of the child's choice and the child's ability to secure admission under the academic standards of that institution. 
The State pools the funds from all participants, invests those funds in a manner that will match or exceed the rate of higher education inflation. 
Under a prepaid tuition plan, the State and the individual family enter into an advanced tuition payment contract naming a student as the beneficiary of the contract. The amount the family must pay depends on the number of years remaining before the student enrolls in college. In most States, purchasers can choose a lump-sum payment or installment payments. Twelve States currently follow this tuition model. Let me explain with an example. 
Today, if a Florida child is 7 years old and his family enrolls him in the Florida prepaid tuition plan, they can enter into a contract and pay a lump sum of $5,900. Then in the year 2008, when the child reaches the age of 18 and enrolls in college, the State will transfer the cost of tuition for 120 credit hours of instruction which has a currently estimated value of $14,350 to the college or university the student chooses to attend. 
Under a State savings plan, individuals transfer money to a State trust which, in turn, invests the funds and guarantees a certain rate of return. Typically, the earnings on the account are exempt from State taxation. Three States follow the State savings fund model. 
One of the attributes of these programs is that just as States establish institutions of higher education to meet the educational needs of their States' citizens, each State program differs in its emphasis. As an example, the Alaska plan allows individuals to direct a portion of the State oil revenues to pay for their contracts. In Alabama, money can be used to take accredited college courses while a student is still attending high school. The Massachusetts plan allows nonresidents to enroll in its plan. Louisiana provides matching grants for certain low-income participants in its plan. 
The tax problem that lies before us today, Mr. President, is whether or not the student should be taxed when the student redeems the funds upon enrollment. Until 1996, the Federal tax treatment of these plans remained murky. In the spring of 1996, the Internal Revenue Service indicated its intent to tax families annually on the earnings of funds transferred to these State plans. 
I thought this was wrong, counterproductive and would discourage what has been a very positive commitment of American families to save for their children's college education. So I worked with Senators McConnell, Breaux, Shelby, and the leaders of the Senate Finance Committee to address the issue in the Small Business Job Protection Act of 1996. Provisions we developed were included in the bill that President Clinton ultimately signed into law. 
The four basic provisions in the 1996 reform were, first, any prepaid or savings entity established by the State is tax exempt. Two, the earnings on money transferred to these State programs are not taxed until distribution. Three, upon distribution, the appreciation on the contracts or accounts will be taxed to the student beneficiary over the time the student attends college. And fourth, these tax rules apply only to contracts and accounts used to fund the cost of tuition, fees, books, and required equipment. 
Mr. President, despite the fact I offered the proposal in the Finance Committee, I have always thought that the right answer was that participation in these programs should be 100 percent tax free. In other words, no taxation upon distribution unless the funds were used for purposes other than qualified educational purposes. 
The legislation that Senator McConnell and I are introducing today will amend section 529 of the Tax Code in two significant respects. First, the bill provides that if distributions from a State fund are used for qualified educational purposes, then there will be no taxation to the student. In other words, there would be no Federal income tax for participation in these State-sponsored programs. 
Second, the bill would expand the definition of qualified higher education expenses. Last year's legislation provided that tuition, books, fees and required equipment were tax exempt. Under the new proposal, we would also include the cost of room and board as qualified educational expenses. 
The bill also makes a number of technical and other changes to assure that States have sufficient flexibility to manage their successful programs. There are several policy-related questions in enacting this legislation, and I will turn to them in a minute. But before doing so, I would like to offer an example of the positive influence of these programs from my State of Florida. 
I would like, Mr. President, to introduce to you Sean and Patrick Gilliland who are in the gallery today. Sean and 
Patrick Gilliland are respectively a senior and junior at the University of Florida. In 1988, the first year the prepaid program was offered to Floridians, Mr. and Mrs. Gilliland purchased prepaid contracts for Sean and Patrick. Two years after purchasing the plan, Mr. Gilliland tragically died, unexpectedly leaving Mrs. Gilliland, Sean and Patrick with a single income. 
Mrs. Gilliland is a nurse. As a result of the change of income, she attests that without the foresight of having purchased a Florida prepaid college program for her two sons, she would not have been able to provide a college education for Sean and Patrick. 
Sean will graduate in 2 weeks from the University of Florida, majoring in business administration with an emphasis in Asian studies. Sean has applied for several overseas positions in Japan, Taiwan, and Korea, with hopes to enter the field of technology in the business world. 
Patrick is currently a junior at the University of Florida, the School of Health and Human Performance, majoring in exercise and sports science. He is a member of Golden Key National Honor Society. He also holds a dean's list grade point average. Patrick is looking forward to continuing his education in a graduate program to prepare him for a profession in cardiological rehabilitation. I wish to both of them the very best in their future endeavors. 
Sean and Patrick Gilliland exemplify the reasons that we need to encourage the expansion of these State-based prepaid college tuition programs. Let me outline several of the policy reasons why it is appropriate and urgent that Congress enact the legislation that we introduce today to clarify the Federal tax treatment of these programs. 
First, Congress needs to support State innovation. Here is an example of a national problem: how to deal with the escalating cost of higher education. The States have provided the energy to address that problem. During the late 1980's and early 1990's, with the Federal Government responding to spiraling college costs in an inadequate manner, States experimented and engineered these programs. The Federal Government should encourage the States by getting the Internal Revenue Service out of the way. 
Second, State plans increase college enrollment, especially among low- and moderate-income families. Experience demonstrates that the discipline and the security offered by these prepaid tuition plans provide the exact incentive that many families need to save for college. 
For example, in Florida, the median income of families with a college student is $50,000. This chart indicates, in `Who goes to college in Florida,' that 22 percent of the families who have children in our State college and university system have incomes of less than $30,000; 26 percent between $30,000 and $50,000. 
On the question, `Who buys contracts for Florida's prepaid college tuition program,' we find that 8 percent are purchased by families with incomes of under $20,000; 17 percent by families between $20,000 and $30,000; and 23 percent by families between $30,000 and $40,000; and 24 percent by families between $40,000 and $50,000. So almost three-quarters of those families who purchase contracts have an income which is at or below the median income of all students attending Florida's colleges and universities. 
This program is providing a powerful incentive for moderate- and low-income Florida families to think about and prepare for their children's education. 
Third, State plans help prepare students psychologically. A family that regularly sets aside money for a child's college education converts the focus of their student child from, `Will I be able to go to college,' to `Will I be sufficiently prepared to be admitted to college and which college do I wish to attend?' 
Fourth, savings is a far superior approach to financing higher education than incurring additional individual and family debt. A prepayment or a savings plan is better economically, both for the family and for the Nation. These programs can also boost the Nation's savings rate. 
For example, Virginia's program has just completed its inaugural enrollment. It signed contracts of over $200 million for Virginia families saving for their children's college education. 
Finally, an expansion of programs will promote downward pressure on tuition rates. Increased participation in State tuition programs not only will provide participants with a guaranteed hedge against education inflation, but it will also produce downward pressure on tuition rates for all students at all colleges. States sponsoring these programs, in essence, guarantee that if earnings on the funds do not exceed increases in tuition rates, then the State will fund the difference when the student enrolls in college. Thus, a State has an incentive to encourage cost efficiency throughout its State system. The pressure will also promote moderate tuition hikes at private schools which must compete with public colleges for students. 
This has been true in Florida. 
Since the inauguration of the Florida prepaid program in 1988, State tuition has risen by an average of 6 percent per year. That is 2 percent less than the national average of 8 percent a year. 
You may say, Mr. President, that, well, 2 percent difference between a particular State's average annual rate of increase in tuition and what is the national average is not a significant amount. Let me put this in dollar terms. 
In 1988, the average tuition in the Nation was $1,827. In Florida, it was $1,163. That is a difference of $664. 
By last year, with the average annual increase of 8 percent, the national average for tuition at State universities had grown from $1,827 to $3,358. Florida's tuition increasing at 6 percent per year had gone from $1,163 to $1,888. That, Mr. President, is a difference of $1,470 per year between the cost of college education in Florida and the average for the Nation. 
I am not saying that Florida's tuition increases have been less than the national average solely because of the Florida prepaid program, but it has been a significant factor. 
We need to do everything we can to hold college costs in check. The expansion of these programs can make a noticeable contribution in that effort. And clarifying the tax consequences of participation will help to facilitate additional States beyond the current 19 who have or will have these programs and increase the number of participating families. 
Mr. President, I would like to particularly thank Senator McConnell for the leadership which he has displayed in making the College Savings Act of 1997 a reality. 
With enactment of this legislation, parents and children will be able to rest easier knowing that Congress has done the right thing by making a college education more accessible. I urge my colleagues in the Senate to join Senator McConnell and me to assure enactment of this important new opportunity for American families to save and plan for the college education of their children.

Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the nomination of my good friend Pete Peterson, and I urge his swift confirmation as our Ambassador to Vietnam. There is no better person for this job. 
Just over 3 years ago I joined the majority of my Senate colleagues in encouraging President Clinton to lift the trade embargo against Vietnam. I did do because I was convinced that it would strengthen and expand joint United States-Vietnamese efforts to determine the fate of those POW's-MIA's still unaccounted for in Vietnam. 
I was less certain about the establishment of full diplomatic relations with Vietnam. I feared that such a step would remove an important incentive to completing our efforts to determine the fate of every POW-MIA. But people like Pete Peterson and John McCain convinced me that reestablishing diplomatic relations was the best way to achieve our objectives in Vietnam--a full accounting of all POW's-MIA's; the implementation of democratic reforms and economic modernization; and respect of basic human rights and fundamental freedoms. 
There is no person more qualified to achieve these noble objectives than Pete Peterson. After spending 6 1/2 years as a prisoner of war in Vietnam--and having left so many of his friends behind--we all can take comfort in knowing that Pete will not rest until every single American POW and MIA is fully and honestly accounted for. This fact was recognized by the Veterans of Foreign Wars, who last year endorsed Pete's nomination. 
Pete's qualifications as an advocate for economic freedom and U.S. business are also quite remarkable. He has served as a member of the House Small Business Committee, fighting for average Americans who are seeking the American dream by building their own businesses. Pete has demonstrated that he will be a fantastic advocate for American business in Vietnam. 
Pete's experience as a prisoner of war gives him unique qualifications to speak frankly and honestly about human rights. As someone who lost every human right, every freedom, and nearly his life in Vietnamese prisons, Pete can speak from the heart on the importance of these basic human values in a way that few of us can. And I know that he will do a superb job. 
And who could be more qualified to heal the wounds of the war, and to build bridges between the peoples of our two nations. Pete has often said that he `left the bitterness at the gate' when he left his prison in Vietnam. His leadership is a major reason that the United States and Vietnam are poised to begin a new era of friendly relations. 
I have had the honor of working with Pete for the past 6 years. Pete represents everything that is great about our country. He is selfless--having served bravely in the Air Force, flying 67 combat missions over Vietnam, and 6 1/2 years as a POW--Pete came home and went to work to make our country a better place. He has faced personal tragedy--losing his wife Carlotta to cancer--and moved on to make good come out of his suffering. And after 26 years in the U.S. Air Force, Pete felt compelled to continue a life of public service. Now having served for 6 years in the House of Representatives, Pete will return to Vietnam under very different circumstances than those under which he left. But he will continue his lifelong commitment to the American people, and I am honored to speak on behalf of this great American. 
There is another quality that Pete possesses that I think will serve him well in his position as our Ambassador to Vietnam. That quality is patience. Pete has waited patiently for over a year for his nomination to come to the floor of the Senate. I am very pleased that Pete's long wait is about to come to an end, and I urge my colleagues to join me in voting to confirm Pete Peterson as the United States Ambassador to Vietnam.

Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today as a proud cosponsor of the Drug Free Communities Act. 
The objective of this bill is to protect our greatest national resource--our children--from the deadly scourge of drug abuse. And it protects them in a way that has been proven through the centuries--by strengthening communities. This bill gives local communities the support they need to keep drugs away from their young people. And it allows them to use it in a way that has proven to be effective in their community, and not as some Washington bureaucrat dictates. 
Unfortunately, recent studies of drug use in America demonstrate the need for a program such as this. The statistics on substance abuse among our Nation's children are particularly disturbing: 
According to the University of Michigan's 1996 study `Monitoring the Future,' half of all high school students have tried some type of illicit drug by the time they graduate. Drug use among eighth graders has risen 150 percent in the last 5 years. Overall, drug use for children between the ages of 12 and 17 has increased more than 100 percent, from 5.3 percent in 1992 to 10.9 percent in 1995. 
The drug most often used by these children continues to be marijuana. More children are smoking marijuana and they are starting to do so at a younger age. According to the `Monitoring the Future' study, almost 25 percent of high school seniors had used marijuana during the previous month. Between 1994 and 1995, the rate of use among 12- to 17-year-olds increased 37 percent, from 6 percent to over 8 percent. 
And the use of marijuana often leads to the use of stronger and more dangerous drugs. A study completed by Columbia University's Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse found that children who smoke marijuana are 85 times more likely to try cocaine than children who have never tried marijuana. 
The use of cocaine and heroin among our children is also on the increase. Among high school seniors in 1996, over 7 percent had tried cocaine at some time. And the number of younger children experimenting with these drugs is alarming. During the last 5 years, heroin use among 8th to 12th graders and the number of 8th graders who had tried cocaine had doubled. 
So what can we do to help our youth reject the temptation to use drugs? We can help families to convince kids that they must never even try illegal drugs. 
That is why I am proud to be a cosponsor of the Drug-Free Communities Act of 1997, which we are here to introduce today. This bill will help communities reduce drug use among youth by providing matching grants of up to $100,000 to community coalitions for the establishment of programs designed to prevent and treat substance abuse in young people. These grants will be used to provide support to local communities who have proven their long-term commitment to reducing drug use among youth. It includes provisions for an advisory commission of substance abuse experts to oversee the program, to ensure that grants go only to those programs that have demonstrated success in keeping our children and grandchildren off drugs. 
There are several reasons why every Member of Congress should support this bill: 
This program helps local communities in a way that is consistent with the 1997 strategy of the Office of National Drug Control Policy. The No. 1 goal of the strategy is to encourage America's youth to reject illegal drugs by assisting community coalitions to develop programs that will accomplish this goal. The grants provided for in the Drug Free Communities Act will establish a partnership between the Federal Government and local communities. 
There are safeguards to prevent abuse of the program. Only established groups that can provide matching funds will be eligible to receive funding. This ensures that only programs that have a proven track record of success in fighting drug abuse among our young people will receive funding. 
I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this important bill. Our children's future depends on keeping them free of drugs, and this legislation will help those groups who can make a difference in the lives of our youth. There is no greater service that we can provide to our country than to keep our children drug-free.

Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today with my distinguished colleague and fellow Florida Gator, Senator Connie Mack, to congratulate this year's national champions and one of the top football programs in the history of the Southeastern Conference, the University of Florida Gators. The Gators clinched their first national championship in football on January 2, 1997 when they defeated the Florida State University Seminoles in the Louisiana Superdome in New Orleans. This year's triumph is indeed special and came on the heels of a perfect nine win season in the Southeastern Conference, which is, as my colleagues know, one of the toughest leagues in college football. 
The Gators defeated the Florida State football team by a score of 52-20 in the Sugar Bowl on January 2nd. It was truly an impressive and memorable display of leadership, dedication and teamwork by a college football team. This historic victory by the Gators not only brought with it the team's first national championship, but the Gators also set an unprecedented number of bowl records including the largest margin of victory against a No. 1 ranked team and the most points scored in a Sugar Bowl game. 
I would also like to commend Florida State's Head Coach, Bobby Bowden and his fine team of football players for their magnificent season and for earning the right to play in the national championship. Although Florida State didn't win the game on January 2nd, they had a great season and they and their fans should be proud of their accomplishments. 
The Gators managed to play its full complement of players during the season and devastated their opponents by averaging: 46.6 points per game, 333.9 yards passing per game and 503.9 yards total offense per game. Among their numerous record breaking achievements on the football field, the Gators' players also managed to bring home the Heisman Trophy, the Maxwell Award, the Unitas Award, the Davey O'Brien Award and the Thorpe Award to name just a few. 
Under the extraordinary tutelage and superior leadership of Head Coach Steve Spurrier, the University of Florida football program rose above all others on the field in 1996. Prior to his arrival in 1990, no Florida Gator football team had captured an official Southeastern Conference championship in 56 years even though the university was a charter member of the league. 
That trend changed in 1990, and Coach Spurrier's Gators have won at least nine games in each season since his arrival. The 1996 Florida Gators have the distinct honor of winning an unprecedented fourth consecutive Southeastern Conference championship and their fifth since Coach Spurrier's arrival. Over the past seven seasons, Coach Spurrier and his talented staff of assistants have posted a remarkable record of 73 wins on the football field, and in the always tough, Southeastern Conference, the Gators have achieved a remarkable record of 53 wins. During his tenure, the Gators have lost exactly two games at Ben Hill Griffin Stadium, an 80,000 seat fortress that Spurrier has dubbed `the swamp.' 
It is clear that the University of Florida Gators have been winners on the football field, but their winning doesn't stop there. Academically, the Gators have excelled equally as well. They have achieved a tremendous graduation rate for an NCAA Division I football program, and 16 members of this year's team were named to the Southeastern Conference's Academic Honor Roll. In addition to their awards for athletic achievement, Lawrence Wright and Danny Wuerffel both received Scholar-Athlete Awards from the College Football Association. 
Their achievements don't stop on the football field, however. The Gators have also been major contributors to the greater Gainesville community where they volunteer countless hours in support of worthy causes like a literacy program, an international youth education program and support students with disabilities. 
As a Gator and a graduate of the University of Florida, I am extremely proud of the 1996 Florida Gators and Head Coach Steve Spurrier for their outstanding achievements both on and off of the football field.

Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, today I join my colleague Senator Chafee in support of the Historic Homeownership Assistance Act. This bill would spur growth and preservation of historic neighborhoods across the country by providing a limited tax credit for qualified rehabilitation expenditures to historic homes. 
An understanding of the history of the United States serves as one of the cornerstones supporting this great nation. We find American history reflected not only in books, films, and stories, but also in physical structures, including schools, churches, county courthouses, mills, factories, and personal residences. 
The bill that Senator Chafee and I are cosponsoring focuses on the preservation of historic residences. The bill will assist Americans who want to safeguard, maintain, and reside in these homes which chronicle America's past. 
The Historic Homeownership Assistance Act will stimulate rehabilitation of historic homes while contributing to the revitalization of urban communities. The Federal tax credit provided in the legislation is modeled after the existing Federal commercial historic rehabilitation tax credit. Since 1981, this commercial tax credit has facilitated the preservation of many historic structures across this great land. For example in the last two decades, in my home State of Florida, $238 million in private capital was invested in over 325 historic rehabilitation projects. These investments helped preserve Ybor City in Tampa and the Springfield Historic District in Jacksonville. 
The tax credit, however, has never applied to personal residences. It is time to provide an incentive to individuals to restore and preserve homes in America's historic communities. 
The Historic Homeownership Assistance Act targets Americans at all economic levels. The bill provides lower income Americans with the option to elect a Mortgage Credit Certificate in lieu of the tax credit. This certificate allows Americans who cannot take advantage of the tax credit to reduce the interest rate on their mortgage that secures the purchase and rehabilitation of a historic home. 
For example, if a lower-income family were to purchase a $35,000 home which included $25,000 worth of qualified rehabilitation expenditures, it would be entitled to a $5,000 Historic Rehabilitation Mortgage Credit Certificate which could be used to reduce interest payments on the mortgage. This provision would enable families to obtain a home and preserve historic neighborhoods when they would be unable to do so otherwise. 
Mr. President, the time has come for Congress to get serious about urban renewal. For too long, we have sat on the sidelines watching idly as our citizens slowly abandoned entire homes and neighborhoods in urban settings, leaving cities like Miami in Florida and others around the nation in financial jeopardy. For example, according to U.S. Census data, in the decade from 1980 to 1990, Chicago lost 41,000 housing units, Philadelphia 10,000, and St. Louis 7,000. The erosion of a sense of community and culture once shared by our urban neighborhoods and towns further magnifies the loss. 
By addressing years of neglect and a general decline in investment in our older neighborhoods, this bill will empower families and individuals with the financial incentives needed to revitalize historic housing in our urban communities. 
Recognizing that the States can best administer laws affecting unique communities, the act gives power to the Secretary of the Interior to work with states to implement a number of the provisions. 
The Historic Homeownership Assistance Act does not, however, reflect an untried proposal. In addition to the existing commercial historic rehabilitation credit, the proposed bill incorporates features from several state tax incentives for the preservation of historic homes. Colorado, Maryland, New Mexico, Rhode Island, Wisconsin, and Utah have pioneered their own successful versions of a historic preservation tax incentive for homeownership. 
At the Federal level, this legislation would promote historic home preservation nationwide, allowing future generations of Americans to visit and reside in homes that tell the unique history of our communities. The Historic Homeownership Assistance Act will offer enormous potential for saving historic homes and bringing entire neighborhoods back to life. 
I urge my colleagues to support this bill for the preservation of history.

Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Puerto Rico Self Determination Act of 1997. I am proud to cosponsor this important legislation with Senator Larry Craig and a bipartisan coalition of eight other distinguished colleagues. 
Mr. President, on December 10, 1898, through the Treaty of Paris that ended the Spanish-American War, Puerto Rico became part of the United States. Next year marks the 100th anniversary of this union. 
Mr. President, there is no better way for us to commemorate this special occasion than to give the U.S. citizens of Puerto Rico the same right that their counterparts in all 50 States and the District of Columbia enjoy--the right to choose their political destiny. 
In 1917, the Jones Act gave the people of Puerto Rico U.S. citizenship, but it was less than complete. Though they are citizens, Puerto Ricans can only vote in Presidential elections if they are registered in a State or the District of Columbia. They have a delegate in Congress--a position currently held by Congressman Carlos Romero-Barcelo--who does not have voting privileges. 
But this lack of political rights is not due to a lack of communication. Throughout their history as part of the United States, Puerto Ricans have expressed their desire to achieve full political rights. They have on various occasions let Congress know of their desire to be full participants in our democracy. And their actions speak even louder than their words. 
Puerto Ricans have contributed in all aspects of American life,--in the arts, in sciences, in sports, and especially in service to the Nation. Their record of service to this country speaks for itself. In World War II alone, more than 65,000 Puerto Rican men and women served in the Armed Forces. In Vietnam, over 60,000 served. The first United States soldier killed in Somalia was Puerto Rican. One of the airmen shot down over Libya in 1986 was Puerto Rican. And it was a soldier from Puerto Rico who sounded the alarm--and saved lives--in the 1983 bombing of the Marine barracks in Beirut. 
I recently received a letter from retired U.S. Army Lt. Col. Dennis Freytes, a Puerto Rican who resides in Orlando. He states in his letter:  
As an American Puerto Rican, who has proudly served our country, I think that Puerto Rico's political status should be promptly resolved, so we don't have second class citizens in our democratic form of government. 
Puerto Ricans voluntarily joined our Armed Forces and have given their lives in defense of our country and democratic way of life. I emphasize `our' because U.S. citizens must have the same rights no matter where they were born or where they choose to live. 
In 1996 and 1997, the Legislature of Puerto Rico, the democratically elected representatives of 3.7 million U.S. citizens, overwhelmingly approved resolutions requesting that the Congress and the President of the United States respond to their legitimate democratic aspirations. They requested that a plebiscite be held not later than December 31, 1998, almost exactly 100 years after Puerto Rico gained territorial status. There have been similar referendums in the past, but those were locally mandated--Congress gave no direction as to how, if at all, the results might affect Puerto Rico's political status. 
It is time for the people of Puerto Rico to have a referendum process which defines the choices in a manner which are constitutionally valid, and that Congress is willing to uphold. 
Mr. President, I want to particularly stress this latter point. Congress needs to understand that if it passes this bill--and I share the hope of my friend and colleague, Senator Craig that we will and that we will do so expeditiously--it is assuming an important political, and moral obligation to the American citizens of Puerto Rico. 
This is not a bill without significant consequences. If Puerto Ricans ask to remain a Commonwealth, we need to respect their wishes. If they want to become a State, we must begin the process of incorporation. And if they desire independence, we must take steps to meet that request. To do otherwise would be to seriously undermine our credibility with the 3.7 million citizens of Puerto Rico and the nearly 300 million residents of Latin America. 
Mr. President, for the last 100 years, the United States had given Puerto Ricans status as citizens but withheld some of the rights, privileges, and responsibilities that come with that privilege. It is time for that to end. Puerto Ricans do not deserve second-class political status. For all that they have done to enrich our culture and defend our Nation from external threats, they have earned the right to decide their own political destiny. 
Mr. President, since the early 1900's, self-determination has been a cornerstone principle of our Nation's foreign policy. 
As we approach the century mark of the union between Puerto Rico and the United States, this bill will serve as a model of American democracy at its best--providing citizens with their right to decide their own futures.

 Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I join my friend and colleague from Arizona, Senator Kyl, in cosponsoring the Internet Gambling Prohibition Act introduced today, which is intended to address a growing problem in the United States as our technology continues to modernize our modes of communication. 
This legislation is an attempt to take a step forward in meeting the needs of State law enforcement organizations and officials. 
With the development of the Internet World Wide Web, the ability of Americans to access information for their personal and professional use has taken a quantum leap. It is safe to say that the Internet is one of the more important technological advances of the late 20th century with respect to the influence that the technology can have on the lives of so many Americans. 
The number of American Internet users has grown from 1 million in 1992 to over 50 million today. This number is expected to grow to several hundred million users by the year 2000. As we bring Internet technology into our schools, we will see greater use of the Internet particularly among our youth, many who are already adept at using their home computers and surfing the Internet for educational and recreational purposes. 
With this convenience and easy access to a variety of information sources, many of which are of great educational, cultural and professional value, come certain expected problems. The one that I want to speak to briefly is that of the increasing use of the Internet for the purposes of gambling. 
The National Association of Attorney Generals has recently studied the problem of Internet gambling. In a 1996 report, `Gambling on the Internet,' the Association cited the following: 
The availability of gambling on the Internet * * * threatens to disrupt each State's careful balancing of its own public welfare and fiscal concerns, by making gambling available across State and national boundaries, with little or no regulatory control. 
There are literally hundreds of gambling-related sites on the Internet. Dozens more are being added monthly. 
Let me make several key distinctions that must be understood with respect to this legislation. 
First, it is important to note that the number of actual online gambling operations are few at this time due to electronic commerce and technical limitations. Advancements in technology, however, make such shortcomings temporary. Only 6 months ago, there were only 17 active Internet gambling sites on the World Wide Web. Today, there are over 200. And, today, there are hundreds of advertisements for gambling as well as informational how-to sites on the Internet. In short, the Internet's ability to serve as an information conduit for the gambling industry has been recognized. 
Second, States have historically been the primary regulator of gambling activities. However, the widespread use of the Internet and its potential to serve as a conduit of gambling activities across national and State borders, serves to undermine States' regulatory control. Our legislation is not intended to disrupt this prerogative, but rather to assist States' ability to enforce its own gambling laws. 
Finally, the legislation would not hold Internet access providers--such as America Online--liable for gambling activities that occur on the Internet. However, the Internet access providers are required, once notified by a State or law enforcement agency of the illegal activity, to discontinue Internet services to the malfeasor. 
Mr. President, there is growing awareness of the importance of this issue in my State of Florida. The attorney general of the State of Florida wrote me on February 17, 1997, urging strong support of this legislation. I am committed to providing strong support in the Congress for Florida law enforcement concerns. 
It is timely and necessary for the Congress to assist States on this growing problem which undermines States' jurisdiction and control. We should support the efforts of our State and local law enforcement officials so that they can prevent the growth of activities which are illegal in that State. 
I thank my colleague from Arizona for his work in drafting this important legislation. I look forward to working with him this year in support of passage of this bill. 
Mr. President, I ask my colleagues in the Senate to join us in supporting this measure.

Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I wish to speak today on the nomination of Anthony Lake to be Director of the Central Intelligence Agency. This nomination has raised a troubling issue, an issue that has nothing to do with the candidate's qualifications. Rather, that issue is the credibility of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence to conduct a fair, nonpartisan examination of this nominee. 
That committee, of which I have been a proud member for 4 years, has a well-earned reputation for bipartisanship. But that hard-won reputation is being jeopardized by the committee's conduct in this matter. 
In a speech before the Senate last night, Chairman Shelby said he wants to treat the Lake confirmation `in a serious, thorough and fair manner.' That is a laudable goal. It is a goal I fully support. I commend the chairman for establishing a high standard. The position of Director of Central Intelligence is an extremely sensitive one. We have a responsibility to the American people to subject the nominee to close scrutiny. 
I accept and welcome the responsibility as a member of the committee. Unfortunately, it is a responsibility my colleagues and I have been unable thus far to exercise. 
The reason for this failure is that the committee, although having officially received this nomination on January 9, has yet to conduct its first hearing on the nominee. Meanwhile, the Senate has acted judiciously but swiftly on two other members of the President's foreign policy team, the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Defense. 
Mr. Lake remains the exception. Indeed, his hearings have been postponed not once, but twice. In the first instance, the chairman postponed the hearings `dependent upon the status of the Justice Department's investigation' into Mr. Lake's stock transactions and his role in the Iran-Bosnia arms sale. 
The Department of Justice completed its investigation on February 7, giving Mr. Lake a clean bill of health in regard to the arms sale and determining there was no evidence that he ever took any action to conceal or misrepresent his or his wife's financial holdings. 
Nevertheless, the chairman again postponed the hearings, this time asserting that the Department of Justice investigation `is only a small part of the Senate Select Intelligence Committee's overall, ongoing investigation * * *' He now cites new concerns. 
After two delays, the chairman is now committed to a hearing on March 11. I welcome that commitment. 
Mr. President, I fear, however, that the March 11 hearing is only a prelude to what is turning into an extended fishing expedition. If anyone doubts that, they only have to read the February 27 issue of the Washington Post, which reported that the Senate Intelligence Committee has now requested White House documents involving Haiti--documents which our House colleagues requested last year as part of their extensive investigations into the administration's Haiti policy. 
Those investigations have so far produced rather paltry results, despite extensive hearings, document reviews and testimony. 
The International Relations Committee was able to generate only a majority staff report. The members of that committee--neither Republican or Democrat--signed the report--not exactly a vote of confidence. 
The Republican majority of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence has yet to produce any report at all. 
In each case, the administration made available literally hundreds of documents for congressional review. 
Although withholding approximately 50 documents, citing executive privilege, the administration did offer to brief House Members and provide certain redacted versions of those documents. Republicans rejected the proposal. 
The administration has made the same offer to our committee. It is a reasonable one that balances congressional rights and executive privilege. I urge the chairman to accept it, rather than creating a pretext for further delay. 
Mr. President, the Haiti issue is just one of several the committee is pursuing. 
The implication of the chairman's remarks are that the committee now intends to investigate the Department of Justice's investigation of Mr. Lake's divesture of stock. The Justice Department, as I mentioned earlier, found no evidence that Mr. Lake ever took any action to conceal or misrepresent his or his wife's financial holdings. It found no fault in his conduct of the Iran-Bosnia matter. 
With regards to Mr. Lake's FBI file and the Tower nomination, the chairman has requested Mr. Lake's complete FBI file, based on the purported precedent of the nomination of former Senator John Tower for Secretary of Defense in 1989. As my colleague from Michigan, Senator Levin, stated yesterday, `neither the Armed Services Committee nor the full Senate ever had access to the raw investigative files used by the FBI to compile its summary of the background investigation of Senator Tower.' 
In his statement, Senator Levin further cites Senator Nunn's comments in 1989. Senator Nunn stated on the Senate floor that, `What we have in S-407 is the summary of interviews the FBI conducted. They prepare the summary. We do not see nor do we have the underlying interviews.' 
In the case of Mr. Lake, that summary has already been provided to the chairman and vice chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee. 
I am concerned that we are engaged in a fishing expedition in which the hearings are being used to determine if some malfeasance can be found, rather than to develop information on a credible hypothesis of inappropriate behavior. 
Mr. President, I am also concerned that the goalposts are clearly being moved on this nominee. Questions are asked; responses are given; and then new, different questions are asked. If members of the committee have inquiries, we should all welcome the opportunity to question this nominee in the best possible forum, under oath, during his confirmation hearings. He in turn has the right and the opportunity to respond. That is the purpose of a nomination hearing. 
Unfortunately, there is a growing public perception, aptly expressed by one commentator, that the committee `seems to be waiting for something scandalous to turn up to sink the nomination.' The perception, right or wrong, is that we are leaving Mr. Lake to twist in the wind. I am afraid that that says more about our committee than it does about Mr. Lake. 
Some history. The Senate Select Committee on Intelligence has a hard-earned and proud tradition of bipartisanship. It is the successor to the Church committee of 1975-76, which was an investigative committee only. The purpose of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence is both to oversee sensitive intelligence activities and to maintain and improve intelligence capabilities and efficiency. 
The issues that come before the committee, including the nomination of the Director of the Central Intelligence Agency, are extremely sensitive. They demand a high level of bipartisanship. I fear that the committee's bipartisanship is fraying and that fair play is falling victim to partisan gamesmanship. 
That, Mr. President, should concern all of us, Republican and Democrat alike. Intelligence activities, by their sensitive nature, run counter to Democratic principles of openness. Yet, in my view, good intelligence is essential to our democracy's security. 
Effective congressional oversight, in turn, is a critical ingredient to maintaining some balance between these two inherently contradictory forces--democratic openness and the necessary secrecy that surrounds intelligence procedures and operations. Oversight is a serious responsibility. The public must have confidence that we are above politics when we deal with intelligence issues. 
In almost every other area of Federal Government, the public has multiple sources of information. That is what freedom of speech and freedom of press provide in a democratic society. But as it relates to the operations of the intelligence community, the general public must rely on a handful of its representatives to provide the necessary oversight and scrutiny to assure that the operations are being conducted in a manner that advances the public interest and assures that the public interest is not being rendered vulnerable by clandestine operations. 
So far, the committee has largely succeeded. One measure of the committee's success has been the impressive number of newly emerging democracies that have sought the Senate Intelligence Committee's advice over the past few years. Each of those countries is struggling to establish an intelligence community that will safeguard democracy, not undermine it. They look to us as a model of bipartisan oversight and have come to us for guidance. 
That expression of confidence is our most valuable asset. We have earned it through hard work, diligence and a determination to play the honest broker. We can ill-afford to fritter it away and give life to the perception that the CIA is becoming an instrument of partisan warfare, that the Lake nomination is simply an attempt to attack the President's foreign policy over the last 4 years. 
The CIA, in turn, can ill-afford partisan bickering at a time when it is struggling with a painful transition from a cold war where we faced one principal enemy to a new world in which we face multiple threats. 
Those emerging threats run the gamut from terrorism and biological and chemical weapons proliferation to narcotics trafficking. Each in its own way is as serious and in some ways more challenging a threat than that presented by the former Soviet Union. 
In attacking these targets, we will need to be focused, creative, and open to new ways of conducting intelligence operations. 
Whether the CIA successfully meets this challenge of transition depends in a large measure on stable leadership, something that has been in disgraceful short supply. 
Whether the CIA successfully meets that challenge depends in large measure on stable leadership, something that has been in disgracefully short supply. Four DCI's have rotated through the Agency in the last 5 years. 
The position of Director of Central Intelligence has become Washington's ultimate revolving door. That's got to stop, and I hope it will with this nominee. 
Success also depends in no small part on the actions the SSCI and this Senate take in regard to Mr. Lake's nomination. This nomination provides us a valuable opportunity to publicly discuss the role of intelligence and its future in our democracy. 
A number of important questions call out for answers. 
With the demise of the Soviet Union, does the CIA have a mission? 
If so, what is it? And if it has a mission, has the Agency lost its way in pursuing it? 
How effectively is the community protecting the interests of America and its citizens? 
Is the culture of the Directorate of Operations hobbling the Agency's effectiveness. If so, how do we change it? 
Is the Agency ready to be held accountable for its actions and its failures? 
What role should human rights play in Agency operations? 
Is the Agency keeping congressional oversight committees and Members of Congress appropriately informed? How effective has it been in this regard? 
An elevated debate, one marked not by partisan rancor but by honesty and openness, can help answer these questions and contribute to reaching a consensus about the intelligence community's role in our society as we enter the 21st century. 
More important, such a debate will help educate ourselves and as well as the voters who sent us here about the appropriate role of intelligence in a democracy--its pluses and its minuses. 
Having said that, there clearly are specific issues regarding this nominee that deserve the committee's scrutiny. 
I question whether Mr. Lake's opponents have focused on the right ones. His supposed connections with the left and his views as to Alger Hiss' guilt or innocence obviously have enthralled some. 
But as former Director of Central Intelligence Bob Gates under President Bush wrote in the January 29 issue of the Wall Street Journal, these issues are `wholly irrelevant and silly.' 
I certainly respect the right of any Member to purse these questions during upcoming hearings. Indeed, I would hope that those who find these issues troubling would urge the chairman to deal with this nomination expeditiously so that we can conclude committee hearings and move to floor debate. 
One question, I intend to ask of Mr. Lake is whether he can provide the President objective intelligence analysis after serving as his National Security Adviser the past 4 years. 
I also intend to ask him whether, having attempted to curry favor with representatives of the Directorate of Operations in an effort to bolster his nomination, he has weakened his ability to act decivisely as DCI on issues of accountability and reform. 
I also plan to ask him whether the nomination process and the criticism he has been subjected to will jeopardize his effectiveness if he is confirmed. Has he been so bloodied that he will be unable to perform effectively? 
Finally, I plan to question him about his management philosophy and skills, his attitude toward secrecy, and the role of human rights in intelligence operations. 
I am confident that Mr. Lake will acquit himself well before the committee. He has shown himself to be a man of great ability and integrity. Moreover, as National Security Adviser he has been an avid customer of intelligence and will bring that critical perspective to the job. 
Barring any stunning revelations that may arise during the hearings--and I see no indication of any occuring--I will vote for Tony Lake. In my view, he will make a fine Director of Central Intelligence. 
Mr. President, the issue for today is, will we protect the credibility? Will we protect the now almost 20 years of investment that has been made in a credible Senate oversight of this most sensitive of Government activities, or will we allow it to be frittered away and degraded by partisan wrangling? That will be the challenge that our committee will face, commencing with the hearings that will begin on March 11. I trust that the committee will meet its high standard.

Mr. GRAHAM. Thank you, Madam President, and I thank the Senator from New York. 
I urge the Senate to move expeditiously to confirm Ambassador Charlene Barshefsky as U.S. Trade Representative. She is the right person at the right time for the very difficult task she will be undertaking. 
I also urge the immediate passage of Senate Joint Resolution 5, without amendment, to extend the waiver for the position which Ambassador Barshefsky currently holds as Deputy U.S. Trade Representative. This waiver as granted under Senate Joint Resolution 5 applies only to Ambassador Barshefsky. It does not change the underlying law, nor does it create a precedent for future waivers. This waiver deserves to pass without amendment. The merits of the issue which are being raised by my friend and colleague from South Carolina deserve to be heard, but I would submit that this is not the forum for the resolution of those questions. There will be other more appropriate times which will not entail endangering the expeditious confirmation of Ambassador Barshefsky to her important post. 
As Senator Moynihan has just stated, when Ambassador Barshefsky's nomination was presented to the Finance Committee, her record was carefully examined. The result of that 
examination was a unanimous vote by the committee in favor of her confirmation. Ambassador Barshefsky was referred to at the confirmation hearing as one of the most qualified, seasoned trade negotiators ever to be offered for this position. As Deputy and Acting U.S. Trade Representative, she has been an outstanding advocate of the trade interests of the United States of America. She has proven herself to be a brilliant negotiator. The Finance Committee and, I hope soon, the Senate as a whole will recognize these qualities. Ambassador Barshefsky has demonstrated a consistent focus on opening global markets, opening those markets through bilateral and multilateral trade agreements that increase export opportunities for U.S. businesses and creates jobs for U.S. workers. She has played an instrumental role in solving trade disputes with Japan, China, and numerous other nations on behalf of the United States. 
Madam President, I was recently in Florida with a group of representatives of important agricultural interests who were looking forward to going to China with Ambassador Barshefsky to open markets for American agriculture in that tremendous nation of population. That is an example of the aggressive pursuit of opportunities for American industry and agriculture that has hallmarked Ambassador Barshefsky's performance in her current positions and will do likewise when she is confirmed as the U.S. Trade Representative. 
It is a pleasure to give this outstanding nominee my unqualified endorsement. I have no question that Ambassador Barshefsky will be an outstanding representative and leader at the U.S. Trade Representative office. I urge my colleagues to join in voting to confirm her nomination today. We need a timely decision. We have already paid a cost for the delay that has occurred to date. The U.S. trade position is weakened when it does not have a confirmed U.S. Trade Representative representing our interests. We need to transfer that weakness into the strength of steel that will come when Charlene Barshefsky represents the United States as our Ambassador, as the U.S. Trade Representative. 
I thank the Chair.

Mr. GRAHAM. Madam President, I want to express my disappointment that we are apparently on a path which will lead to yet another defeat of a balanced budget amendment. This could be seen as a lack of commitment to balance the budget. 
My hope is that it will be seen instead as a message that a significant minority in Congress does not think a balanced budget amendment is necessary to achieve a balanced budget. 
That without the discipline of a balanced budget amendment, the President and Congress will redouble our efforts to get to balance in 2002 and to remain in balance in future years. 
I agree with critics who say we can balance the budget by 2002 without a constitutional amendment. That same statement could have been made at virtually any time since our last balanced budget in 1969. We have not done so. 
CBO projections indicate that without changes in our current budget policies, the deficit will rise to $280 billion by 2007, nearly reaching the levels we experienced during the late 1980's and early 1990's. 
The President's budget as submitted for the next 5 years and analyzed by CBO, projects that the deficit will jump from our 1996 level of $107 billion to $145 billion in 1998. The deficit will stay near that level until 2001. 
This trend line is not a reassuring trumpet blast of commitment to a balanced budget. I hope that my colleagues are correct in saying we can keep the budget balanced without a constitutional amendment. 
We are about to be put to the test. 
Most States have a constitutional requirement for a balanced budget. 
As Governor, I operated under a balanced budget. I can say with experience that it has served my State well. It would also serve our Nation well. 
There are numerous State legislatures asking that we in Congress submit a balanced budget amendment to them. 
In the short time that State legislatures have been in session this year, 4 have passed resolutions asking Congress to approve a balanced budget amendment; another 21 States have introduced resolutions asking for a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution. 
We owe the States an opportunity to decide whether we should amend the constitution to put an end to the growing Federal debt that this country has been building. 
And although we have made tremendous progress over the past 4 years, we still have a large and expanding annual deficit. 
Our national debt is expected to reach $5.4 trillion at the end of this fiscal year. 
One concern that many of my colleagues have expressed is their concern for how Social Security would fare under a balanced budget amendment. 
My personal feeling is that establishing the principal of a balanced budget during normal periods, such as most of the years since 1982, would strengthen the Social Security system. 
If we had passed a balanced budget amendment in 1982, the first year in recent history that one was considered and defeated, we would have $2.9 trillion less in debt held by the public than we do today. 
The interest on this portion of the Federal debt alone totaled $190 billion in 1996. Last year, that amount was more than enough to pay for all Medicare expenses. Instead this money was dissipated on interest payments. 
That same $190 billion in interest payments on the additional debt accrued since 1982 could have paid for over half of all the money the Federal Government spent last year on Social Security retirement benefits. 
Let us look at Social Security from another angle--in 1982 the total interest on the Federal debt was $85 billion. In that year, all Social Security benefits were $156 billion. 
The interest payment equaled about half of the Social Security benefits for that year. 
In 1996, the total interest in the Federal debt was $241 billion and Social Security retirement benefits were $350 billion. 
The interest payment in 1996 equaled about three-quarters of the entire outlay for Social Security retirement benefits. 
Yearly interest payments are growing faster than yearly Social Security payments. This trend is not good and we must put an end to it now. 
Passing the balanced budget amendment now is critical to the future health of our Social Security system. 
Let me ask you--would our country be better off spending tax dollars to service the Federal debt or for needed programs like Social Security? 
I believe the money would be better spent on Social Security. 
The budget deficit has become a permanent fixture in our Nation's fiscal policy. 
While there are those who say Congress can, without a constitutional amendment, balance the budget, history has shown this not to be the case. 
A disturbing example of the lack of resolve to balance the budget occurred last Thursday evening when we extended the aviation tax to September 30--ignoring losses of $5 billion in Federal revenue for the aviation trust fund because of lapses in the aviation tax during 10 of the last 14 months. 
Five billion dollars lost for American aviation safety. 
We extended the tax to September 30 knowing that a report on whether the current tax should be replaced by a user fee system is not due to Congress until October 1997. 
We voted to terminate the ticket tax on September 30, raising the strong possibility of another lapse at the end of this fiscal year with the excuse that we should wait for the report. Why did we do this? 
We did it for budget scoring purposes. 
By allowing the tax to expire on September 30 before reinstating it, our Budget rules will claim to create almost $6 billion in `new' revenue every year after September 30, 1997, for a total of over $30 billion between then and September 30, 2002. 
It is for this kind of creative accounting that we send people to jail in the private sector. 
Some 40 percent of the revenue increases in the President's budget from 1997 to 2002 come from this scoring gimmick. 
The President and the Congress must be strong in their resolve to achieve balance through tough decisions rather than through creating fictional new revenue or spending cuts. 
This archaic and destructive maneuver is exactly what undercuts public confidence in our ability to balance the budget with real numbers and rational policies. 
With failures like this in mind, and after witnessing numerous attempts by Congress to enact legislation to force itself to tighten its fiscal belt, my conclusion is that we must pass an amendment to constitutionally mandate a balanced budget. It is imperative that we not lose this opportunity. 
Madam President, the failure to pass a balanced budget amendment today would be a grave mistake. 
For too many years we have delayed the hard decision until tomorrow. 
Well, Madam President, tomorrow has come. It is our generation's duty to ensure that we pay our national bills rather than asking our children and grandchildren to do so.  
Mr. HATCH addressed the Chair.

Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I am an original cosponsor of the balanced budget amendment. I support the amendment. It is an important measure, both to maintain the momentum toward a balanced budget and to assure that, once we have reached a point of balance, we will stay there. For far too long, our Nation has been living on borrowed money, the credit cards of our children and our grandchildren. Our children and grandchildren deserve better. They deserve to inherit a nation whose fiscal house is in order. 
Today, every child in America is saddled with a debt at birth of more than $20,000. That debt is growing. I believe strongly that the long-term economic future of our country is in jeopardy. It is in jeopardy unless we are able to arrest this mountain of annual deficits and the cumulative national debt. Arresting this increase is the only way to assure fiscal restraint over the future decades. 
This administration deserves a great deal of credit. When President Clinton came into office, he was faced with the largest annual deficit in the history of America, $290 billion. Over the past 4 years, that deficit has been reduced to $107 billion--a very significant accomplishment. However, a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution can guarantee that future Presidents and future Congresses cannot repeat the mistakes of recent history. We cannot do as we have done in the last 20 years, add $4.5 trillion to our national debt. 
I believe, therefore, that in its current form, the balanced budget amendment is clearly superior to the alternative, which is the status quo that has served us so poorly over the last two decades. 
That said, I want to point out that the balanced budget amendment as it is currently written is, in my judgment, flawed. Section 2 of the balanced budget amendment--and I ask my colleagues who are here today, and those who might be watching on television, if they would take this opportunity to read section 2--section 2 purports to control the limit on debt held by the public. But I believe that the complex policy implications of this section make it one of the least understood provisions of this constitutional amendment. Without a doubt, section 2 is the key to ensuring the enforcement of the balanced budget amendment. It has been referred to as the safety lock of the balanced budget amendment. But it simply does not go far enough to control the growth of the Federal debt, and it denies us some important policy objectives which could be accomplished by the adoption of the amendment which I offer. 
I would like to first read the precise language of section 2. Section 2 states: 
The limit of debt held by the public shall not be increased unless three-fifths of the whole number of each House shall provide by law for such an increase by a rollcall vote. 
That is, verbatim, the language of section 2. My amendment would strike four words from section 2. Those words are `held by the public,' therefore, leaving the amendment as originally written except `the limit of debt shall not be increased unless three-fifths of the whole number. 
These four words constitute less than a sentence within the balanced budget amendment. They carry with them a number of important policy implications. 
Under the proposed amendment, three-fifths of the whole number of each House would be needed to raise the debt ceiling as it relates only--and I emphasize only--to that debt held by the public, not to the total Federal debt. 
This provision will assist in enforcing the balanced budget amendment by creating a voting requirement of 40 percent plus 1 to increase the debt. Simply that 41 Senators will refuse to go along with the proposal to raise the debt held by the public should serve as a powerful enforcement mechanism, but it does not go far enough to halt the growth of the Federal debt. 
Mr. President, let me provide a little background regarding the distinction between debt held by the public, the language that is currently in section 2, and the total national debt, which would be the application of section 2 if my amendment were adopted. 
The total national debt, sometimes referred to as debt subject to limit, is divided into two categories: debt held by the public and debt that the Government owes itself. 
On this chart, the blue section is that portion of our national debt which is held by the public. Today, it is approximately $3.9 trillion. Debt held by the public is that debt which is issued to individuals, corporations, State or local government, the Federal Reserve System, foreign governments, and central banks. All of that constitutes debt held by the public which today represents $3.9 trillion. 
Debt the Government owes to itself is the total of all trust fund surpluses, including those of Social Security, Medicare, and Federal retirement programs. Under current law, surpluses in these trust funds must be invested in Federal Government securities. Social Security is the largest of these, currently accounting for $638 billion of trust fund balances. 
Mr. President, the red component of this chart represents the amount of the total Federal debt which is owed to the Social Security trust fund. Today, it is $638 billion. The green represents the borrowing of the Federal Government from all other Federal trust funds. That number has been, over time, approximately $900 billion. And I have depicted it on this chart, for purposes of display, as a consistent $900 billion. 
The total of the Federal Government debt that is not held by the public--that is, that debt which would not be subject to constraint under this amendment--is currently $1.6 trillion. 
The Congressional Budget Office projects that the total Federal debt, all debt owed by the Federal Government, will be $5.4 trillion at the end of this fiscal year. 
I am not surprised that there is some confusion about this arcane subject of the allocation of the total Federal debt among various categories. That confusion has permeated the committee that reported this bill, it has permeated Members of the executive branch and the media. Let me just cite some examples of that misunderstanding. 
Mr. President, on our desks, each Senator has a copy of the report of the Judiciary Committee when it recommended favorably the adoption of the balanced budget amendment. Let me quote from the committee report on page 20. It states: 
To run a deficit, the Federal Government must borrow funds to cover its obligations. Section 2 removes the borrowing power from the Government, unless three-fifths of the total membership of both Houses vote to raise the debt limit. 
Wrong. This statement is inaccurate, because section 2 does not limit the Government's ability to borrow. In fact, as this chart indicates, under current law and the requirement that the Federal Government borrow all of the surpluses that are available from these trust funds, by the midpoint of the second decade of the 21st century, the Federal Government will have an indebtedness of $8.5 trillion, and everything above the blue line can be encumbered by a majority vote of the Congress, without the protection of the three-fifths vote. This is not speculation, this is ordained by the laws that we have passed and the absence of a three-fifths vote for all of the debt above the blue line. The Government will borrow almost $2 trillion of additional indebtedness between the year 2002 and 2019. 
But it is not just our own Judiciary Committee that misunderstands the application of section 2. The Secretary of the Treasury, Robert Rubin, blurred the distinction in an opinion column he wrote in the Washington Post on February 2 of this year, where he said:  
Finally, as we saw in 1995 and 1996, the history of debt limit shows that raising the statutory debt limit is never an easy process. Yet, right now it is possible to raise the debt limit with a simple majority vote in both Houses. By requiring a three-fifths supermajority vote, the amendment would make it far more difficult. 
Again, the Secretary fails to point out the distinction that the three-fifths vote only applies to that portion of the debt which is held by the public, not to that growing portion of debt which is going to be represented by borrowings from the surpluses of the Federal trust funds, especially that enormous trust fund of Social Security. 
Even more, the news media has led the American people to believe that this amendment will provide a safety lock on all future borrowings. The February 21, 1997, edition of the Washington Post, for example, indicated that `a three-fifths majority of both Houses would be required to waive the requirement and to raise the national debt limit.' 
Wrong. The only three-fifths requirement would be to that dwindling portion of the national debt which is represented by that which we borrow from the general public and would not apply to the indebtedness which we borrow, essentially, from ourselves through the Federal surpluses in trust funds. 
Mr. President, I believe that we should deliver to the American people what the American people expect. They expect an amendment that would provide for control on the total national debt. That is what we have led them to believe we are considering. 
Probably one of the most commonly used examples of our runaway national debt is the debt clock. It is not on the floor today, but it was in the Judiciary Committee on the day that I testified in favor of the balanced budget amendment. 
What are the numbers on that clock? The numbers on that clock are not the numbers that reflect debt held by the public. The numbers on that clock are those that are consistent with the national debt of $5.4 trillion. That is the debt that the American people have been led by us to believe that we are trying to control. 
I believe that in order to avoid further adding to the skepticism and cynicism of the American people, we ought to give them an amendment which is consistent with what they believe we are providing to them because that is what we have told them we are trying to accomplish. 
Unless there is a compelling reason to do otherwise, we should pass a balanced budget amendment that meets the expectations of the American people and places a constraint on total national debt. 
It will be to those who wish to use their portion of the time to oppose my amendment to explain what that compelling national interest is that says that we should only limit one segment of the national debt and should let the other balloon to an $8.5 trillion national debt within the lifetime of most of the people who are in this room and listening to this on television. 
I find no such compelling reason. I find, to the contrary, powerful reasons to deliver an amendment that the people expect. Not only would such an amendment be consistent with our representations and the expectations of the American people, this amendment would have some powerful policy benefits. 
First, it would have the effect of avoiding another massive increase in national debt. Adopting the amendment that I offer would say that as of the effective date, the year 2002, that rather than have the then $6.7 trillion continue to grow to $8.5 trillion, that $6.7 trillion--an enormous, staggering national debt as it is--at least would become the plateau for our national debt, that we would not allow further growth in our total debt without a three-fifths vote of the Congress to do so. I believe that would be a tremendous benefit to the American people. 
I would like to talk about some of the other policy implications that are involved in subjecting total national debt, as opposed to only that component of debt held by the public, to the three-fifths requirement. 
Applying the three-fifths restraint to debt held by the public is going to create an unintended consequence. That unintended consequence is that there will be an incentive to borrow from these trust funds because you can borrow from the trust funds by a majority vote. It takes a three-fifths vote to issue debt to the public. Therefore, the likelihood is that we will see, as the chart indicates, a dramatic expansion in the proportion of our national debt which is held by these trust funds. 
Those who are concerned about the long-term security of Social Security ought to be very concerned when they see that not only is the national debt rising to $8.5 trillion, and every one of those trillion dollars will require in the range of $65 to $75 billion a year in debt service, but also they will see that we have not accomplished what the Greenspan commission in 1983 contemplated would be accomplished in terms of the use of the Social Security surpluses. 
Let me just divert for a moment to go back to where we were in the late 1970's and the early 1980's. 
Up until that time Social Security was a pay-as-you-go system. Every year the Congress would look at the amount of money that was likely to be required to meet obligations in the next year, would examine how much was coming into the trust fund and, if there was a gap, would appropriate what was required in order to meet that year's obligations for Social Security. 
There was recognition that as our demographics were changing and larger and larger numbers of people were coming into the Social Security system and they were living longer and therefore utilizing the system for more years, that that pay-as-you-go system was a certain railroad track to disaster. 
So in 1983, under President Reagan, a commission was established to look at the long-term well-being of Social Security. That commission recommended that the United States adopt a system, which is used by most other industrialized countries which have a Social Security System, that rather than have a pay-as-you-go program, we would have a program in which the Social Security System would consciously and purposefully operate in a surplus position during those years when there was relatively less demand on the system so that when the demand increased, there would be a pool of resources in order to meet those additional obligations of the Federal Government to America's retirees. 
This all occurred at a time when we were still operating in the national tradition of relatively modest national debt. As recently as 1980, we had a national debt of less than $1 trillion. That was the environment in which the Greenspan commission was making its recommendations. 
So what did they expect we would do with all of these surpluses that their proposal was directing be accumulated in order to have a pool of resources to meet future demands? What they contemplated was that the Social Security surpluses would be used to buy down the debt held by the public. In fact, their calculations in the early 1980's were that we would have virtually eliminated the debt held by the public, the surpluses in Social Security would have been so great. 
What they failed to anticipate was the fact that we would lose all this tradition of fiscal discipline in the country and would go into an unprecedented period of a binge of deficits that would escalate our national debt from less than $1 trillion to today's $5.4 trillion. 
My amendment will return us to what was the expectation of the Greenspan commission, albeit not to the extent that they had contemplated because conditions are different in 1997 than they were in 1983. 
What we will be doing with this amendment is we will be not adding to the national debt through the additions to the Social Security surplus, but rather will be buying down the debt which is currently held by the public so that when we reach the point that we will start making substantial payments to the baby-boomer wave of retirees, we will be operating from a dramatically lower level of total national debt and an equally dramatically lower level of debt held by the public. 
If you are concerned about the security of the Social Security System, if you want to say, `I want to have a balanced budget amendment, but I don't want to have a balanced budget amendment that is excessively complex which is written in statutory terms rather than constitutional terms,' my friends, I would suggest that the way to accomplish all of those objectives and to do what the commission that gave us our current Social Security System contemplated is to adopt my amendment and direct that these Social Security surpluses will not be used as the basis of new national debt but rather will be used as the basis for substitution for the debt that is currently held by the public. 
In my opinion, and representing a State which has proportionately more Social Security beneficiaries than any other State in the Nation, this is the way to protect Social Security at the same time we protect our grandchildren against an enormous layering on of additional debt. 
Mr. President, the amendment that I have offered would eliminate the current amendment's incentive to excessively borrow from Social Security because all national debt, whether it is held by the general public or held from internal accounts such as Social Security, will be treated equally in terms of the three-fifths requirement in order to exceed the level of debt that existed in the year 2002. 
Mr. President, I recognize that this is a somewhat difficult subject matter, 
however, it is critical subject matter if we are to accomplish our objective of providing to the American people what they believe they are getting from this balanced budget amendment, to save the American people almost $2 trillion in debt between now and the year 2019. 
I point out, Mr. President, that all of the numbers I have used in these charts are numbers that have been provided by the Congressional Budget Office. They are the numbers that we as Members of Congress are obligated to use in our budget analysis in our budgetary decisions. 
Mr. President, I believe, in summary, that there are five reasons why we should adopt this amendment. It is honest. It limits debt as it has been defined historically. It is the same definition of debt that we use when we have to periodically pass resolutions to raise the national debt. We are raising the total national debt limit, not just that component that is held by the public. We will be doing what the American people think they have directed us to do. 
Second, it is fiscally conservative. It will prevent adding another $2 trillion to the national debt in the next 25 years. In fact, this amendment is the most conservative of any amendment which is currently being considered by the Senate. 
Third, it is simple. It does not add complex additional theories to the balanced budget amendment. It deletes words which may appear to be benign but which, in my opinion, have serious negative policy implications when we only restrict the national debt to that held by the public. 
Fourth, it will have a very positive impact on the Nation's economy. It will release the $2 trillion, which under the amendment, the balanced budget amendment section 2 language that is currently before the Senate, will be used to fund additional national debt, will become $2 trillion that can be used to invest in the private sector, contribute to lower interest rates, stimulating economy growth and more jobs. 
When the Social Security surpluses are used to buy down the debt held by the public, less private capital will be tied up in Government borrowing. Those private investment resources will be redirected to the private sector, creating positive economic growth. 
Fifth, it will protect the Social Security from those in Congress who would exploit its unique standing as the easiest source of capital from which to borrow. Social Security trust funds will be treated equally and fairly under my amendment with all other sources of borrowing by the Federal Government, without giving any program any special standing in the Constitution and not creating the perverse incentive to go first to the Social Security trust fund for borrowing. 
Mr. President, again, I recognize we are dealing with an arcane, frequently misunderstood section of the balanced budget amendment. From the Judiciary Committee report, to opinion columns, to leaders in the administration, there is confusion about what section 2 means and what it will do. But there is no excuse for this Senate to misunderstand what this provision means. Our whole purpose in the constitutional scheme is to be that part of the Government that can deliberate, can consider complex matters and reach resolutions that are in the national interest. Let us not allow this opportunity to pass us by. 
We have the chance here to save almost $2 trillion in financial obligations for our children and grandchildren. To release that $2 trillion to help create the jobs for our children and grandchildren, to preserve the Social Security trust fund, and to give the American people what they have a right to expect from this balanced budget amendment, a restriction on the total national debt that they will be required to pay. I urge the adoption of this amendment.

Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, since this debate started, I have received a letter from the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare, dated today, which I would like to submit for the Record. To quote one paragraph: 
S.J. Res. 1 requires a three-fifths, super-majority vote to increase `public' borrowing, but since it does not require such Congressional approval for trust fund borrowing, it provides a powerful incentive for the increased use of trust fund borrowing as a means to pay for general fund programs. We support your effort to correct this definition of `debt' as a needed improvement. 
The letter is signed by Martha McSteen, president of the National Committee to Preserve National Security and Medicare.

Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, the Senator from Idaho raised several points. I want to focus on three. 
First, he raises the issue of, are we adding a speculative element into this balanced budget amendment by applying debt to the total debt rather than to only that component of the national debt which is held by the public. I suggest quite to the contrary--that it is exactly the definition that we are using which this Congress has written into the statute. It is the definition that we use when we are required to assess whether we are about to exceed the national debt. So it is the definition that is not speculative. It is the definition that we are accustomed to using. It is the definition that the American people understand, in part because we have helped them understand it by using things like the debt clock, which focuses on the total national debt. 
Finally, and most fundamentally, the debt is not a projected amount, it is a fiscal reality. It is, as anyone knows who has ever balanced a family budget or dealt with the books of a business, the last number on the page after you have looked at what your revenues are, what your expenses are, and you can see whether you are in a profit or a debt situation. That is the circumstance that the U.S. Government is in when we look at that bottom number and say, oh, my goodness, we have just added another $107 billion of deficit in the fiscal year 1997 that will then become an additional layer on top of our national debt. 
Second, the Senator from Idaho raises a very significant and interesting issue. That is what are we going to do after the year 2019. 
I might say the chart that the Senator has could be replicated precisely on the chart of the balanced budget amendment as submitted. That is the amendment that only restricts debt held by the public. This constitutional amendment and the constitutional amendment with my amendment, all are going to face the very difficult issue of what do you do when you reach that point sometime in the second decade of the 21st century when, instead of running a surplus in the Social Security system, as we are today, and will for the next 20 or so years, we suddenly start to run big deficits as all of those people born after 1945 begin to retire? It is their turn to become eligible for Social Security. And enormous deficits are going to be run in the Social Security system. 
Those are not speculative or imaginative. They are exactly what the 1983 Social Security Commission contemplated. Add surpluses during periods of relatively limited numbers of Americans benefiting by Social Security so that we can meet the obligations when we are in a demographic period with large numbers of retirees. 
So what are we going to do when we get out here to around the year 2019? Frankly, there is no free lunch. What we have been doing is, we have been borrowing from the general fund from Social Security. Social Security does not have a great bank filled up with stocks and bonds, or real estate deeds, or other assets that have a market value. What it has is IOU's from the General Treasury. 
Beginning in about the year 2019, the Social Security beneficiaries are going to be knocking on the door of that vault, saying, `We want to redeem these IOU's.' What are we going to do? We basically have three choices. 
We have the choice of reducing spending every place else in the Federal Government sufficient to release the money to be able to redeem the IOU's and pay off this obligation. We can raise taxes sufficiently to do the same thing. Or, we can begin again to borrow from the public, in order to be able to substitute borrowing from the public, in order to meet the borrowing that we have been doing for the last three decades from the Social Security trust fund. 
If somebody has another alternative to those three, or some combination, I would suggest that they might want to identify them. 
What is going to be the difference between where we will be under the bill as it is introduced and where we will be under the bill as my amendment would have it? First, instead of having to repay, dealing with a Federal deficit at $8.5 trillion, we are going to be approximately $2 trillion less in debt. If you had a big obligation coming, wouldn't you feel better about your ability to meet it if you were relatively less indebted than if you were more indebted? Clearly, the Nation will be better off, better positioned to meet its obligations, if it starts from a lower position of national debt. 
Under the amendment that we have, when we come to this period in the year 2019, and we elect not to cut spending and we don't want to raise taxes as the only two ways to meet this obligation to meet the payment of the IOU's that the General Treasury will owe to the Social Security trust fund, but we would like to consider borrowing from the public, what is our 
position going to be? For two decades we will have been operating under a constitutional amendment that says you can borrow from these trust funds by a majority vote, which is relatively not easy but past history has shown is not politically a Mount Everest to climb. But we are going to say you have to have a three-fifths vote to borrow from the public. 
So we are going to find ourselves in about 20 years facing the prospect of having to, for the first time, use that three-fifths vote requirement to increase the debt held by the public, having ballooned the debt by a majority vote from our borrowings from these other trust funds. And I would suggest that is not going to be a very happy time to be a Member of the U.S. Congress. 
I think that what we are doing today is leaving to our successors--not in the far distant future but just about 20 years from now--an extremely indebted America with a constitutional structure that is going to make it very difficult for us to meet our obligations to those Social Security beneficiaries. 
My amendment would have us enter that period with substantially less indebtedness. We would have been applying this three-fifths vote to all borrowing, not just to that held by the public. 
But the most significant difference of how we will be in the year 2019 goes to the very first point that the Senator from Idaho talked about. It is not correct to say that the only thing you can do with Social Security surpluses is borrow. If that is the case, then clearly we are locked into this chart. Clearly, we are looking like a plane that is on automatic pilot and all the members of the cockpit have bailed out. 
We know where we are heading. We are heading to an $8.5 trillion national debt, if, in fact, we are required to borrow all of the money from these trust funds and add it to the national debt. That is not what the Greenspan commission contemplated in 1983. That is not what my amendment would allow us to do; that is, instead of adding to the national debt, why don't we take those surpluses and pay off some of the debt we have already so we don't have to continually place our children and grandchildren under a greater and greater burden? But, rather, we can face the day when we will have to make substantial repayments of these Social Security IOU's. This is the best possible fiscal condition for America, and with our debt to the general public at the lowest level that our fiscal condition over the next two decades will allow us to be. 
So, Mr. President, we do have an alternative. We are not obligated to have $8.5 trillion in debt. We can make that debt clock tick in the future as we are representing. We can make it a means by which we can protect our future, not enslave our future. 
Mr. President, just to summarize again with greater brevity why I think this amendment is critical, it is honest. It does what the American people expect us to do. It is fiscally conservative. It saves almost $2 trillion in borrowing. It is simple and direct. It is not complicated. It will have a positive impact on our Nation's economy by releasing $2 trillion into the private sector. The only real long-term salvation of Social Security--and our retirement systems, whether they are Government or otherwise--is a strong American economy. And if we can put $2 trillion more into that private economy, we will be making a fundamental contribution to the strength of our Social Security and all of our other retirement programs. 
We would avoid the temptation, as the National Committee for the Preservation of Social Security and Medicare points out, to use the Social Security system as the cash cow, as the point of first preference for borrowing for the Federal Government by saying we are not going to establish a different standard for borrowing from the Social Security fund than we apply to borrowing from the general public. Both would be subject to a supermajority of three-fifths of the Members of the Congress in order to increase the total national debt. 
So, Mr. President, for those reasons, I respectfully suggest the analysis of the Senator from Idaho is not an appropriate projection of the consequences of this amendment and that, rather, the honesty, the reduction of the total national debt and the protection of Social Security by, among other things, stimulating a higher rate of economic growth in America are the goals which are sought and I believe will be accomplished by the adoption of this amendment. 
I thank the Chair.  
Exhibit 1 NATIONAL COMMITTEE TO PRESERVE 
Social Security and Medicare, Washington, DC, February 26, 1997. 
Dear Senator Graham: On behalf of its five and a half million members and supporters, the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare wishes to express our support for your proposed amendment to S.J. Res. 1, a resolution to amend the Constitution to require a balanced federal budget. Among our concerns about S.J. Res. 1 is that it would change the current definition of federal debt. Your proposed amendment would change the current language `debt held by the public' in S.J. Res. 1, to include all federal debt, particularly that which the government holds for itself--i.e. the federal trust funds. We appreciate your leadership on this important issue. 
As drafted, S.J. Res. 1 contains a provision which intentionally removes Social Security trust fund holdings of U.S. securities from the definition of `public debt,' even though the trust fund money was borrowed to finance the deficit. This change would permit the Treasury to increase its debt by borrowing from the trust funds without obtaining the Congressional approval required to borrow money from other sources. 
S.J. Res. 1 requires a three-fifths, super-majority vote to increase `public' borrowing, but since it does not require such Congressional approval for trust fund borrowing, it provides a powerful incentive for the increased use of trust fund borrowing as a means to pay for general fund programs. We support your effort to correct this definition of `debt' as a needed improvement. 
Sincerely, 
Martha A. McSteen, President.

Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, to close briefly, let me underscore that I support the balanced budget amendment. I will vote for the balanced budget amendment in the form it was reported by the Judiciary Committee. I do so because I believe it is superior to the alternative of continuing with the status quo, a status quo that had added $4.5 trillion to our national debt in less than 20 years. 
I believe, however, that the balanced budget amendment can be improved. I have suggested what I think is an important area of that improvement, and that is that after we have achieved the objective of section 1 of the balanced budget amendment, which is to see that we will bring as rapidly as possible our annual accounts into balance, we will not be adding to the national deficit, that we will then place a safety lock on that gain by saying there shall not be any further increases in the national debt without a three-fifths vote of both Houses of Congress. 
The amendment that is before us does not do that, although there are many who believe that it does that, because the three-fifths vote only applies to that portion of the national debt which is held by the public, by individuals, by corporations, by State and local governments, by all the people who buy Federal securities. 
My amendment would strike that limitation and have the requirement of a three-fifths vote of both Houses of Congress apply to all of the national debt. It would apply to the totality of the $5.4 trillion national debt that we now have. 
Mr. President, there was some suggestion in the concluding remarks of the Senator from Idaho that in some way by my amendment I had weakened the existing three-fifths requirement that is in the constitutional amendment as it relates to debt held by the public. Absolutely to the contrary. I am extending the same three-fifths requirement to the rest of the debt of the Federal Government, continuing to apply it to debt held by the public, but also applying it to that debt which the Federal Government borrows from its own trust funds. 
In brief summary, Mr. President, I believe the following reasons are why this amendment should be adopted: 
It is honest. 
It comports with what the American people believe we are doing when we say we are restricting national debt. 
It is fiscally conservative. It will result in almost $2 trillion less national debt over the next 20 years than will be almost certainly the case if we do not adopt this amendment. 
It is simple. It does not add new or complex concepts to the balanced budget constitutional amendment. 
It will have a very positive effect on the Nation's economy. The result of releasing $2 trillion that otherwise would be used to finance unnecessary and excessive national debt into the private sector will increase our Nation's economic growth and strength. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 60 seconds to conclude my remarks.

Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, finally, by using these surpluses, as the 1983 Social Security Commission had anticipated they would be used, to reduce the amount of Federal debt which is currently owed to the general public and, therefore, place our Nation in a stronger fiscal position to meet our future obligations to Social Security, we will be strengthening the Social Security system. And for that reason, the National Committee for the Preservation of Social Security and Medicare has endorsed this amendment. 
I urge the adoption of this amendment which I believe is exactly consistent with the purposes of the balanced budget amendment, will add to its strength, and will add to the acceptance of the American people, because it will be the amendment that they believe we are about to adopt and submit to the States for ratification. I urge the adoption of this amendment.

Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, what concerns me--and why I want 
to make this statement before we vote it--is the irony of what we are doing at this hour of the night. We have spent the past several days, the past several weeks, debating an amendment of the U.S. Constitution to require a balanced budget. I support that amendment and look forward to voting for it on Tuesday. 
In the midst of that debate, we now at this hour are going to take up legislation to extend the airline ticket tax, which has been expired for 10 of the past 14 months. I support that. We should reenact the airline ticket tax. In my opinion, we should not have allowed it to expire as we have. 
But what is significant about what we are about to do is that we are extending the airline ticket tax to September 30, 1997. Why are we doing that? Is it because we do not need the resources of this revenue source beyond September 30, 1997? Clearly not. 
There are extensive needs in the national aviation system. There are extensive needs in virtually every community which has an airport--a commercial airport or a general aviation airport--which benefits by the resources derived from this tax. 
In light of that, why are we enacting this extension from now until September 30, 1997? We paid a heavy price because of the fact that this tax has been allowed to lapse twice in the past 14 months. This tax expired on January 1, 1996. It was nearly 8 months later, August 27, 1996, that it was reenacted. That reenactment, however, was only until the end of the calendar year 1996, December 31. It has lapsed since that date until today. 
So since January 1, 1996 until today, the tax has been in effect approximately 4 months. It has been in a lapse status for 10 months. Every day that this tax is not in effect reduces the revenue to the aviation trust fund by over $15 million; approximately $500 million a month is lost to the support of safety in the air because of our failure to keep this tax consistently, stably in place. 
In light of that history, I ask again, why today are we only enacting this until September 30, 1997? Why are we not making this a permanent tax today as it has been for most of its history? 
Well, Mr. President, I must sadly report that we are doing this for exactly the reason that we have gotten into a $5.4 trillion national debt. Here tonight, in the middle of the debate on a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution of the United States, we are about to engage in what I consider to be one of the more hypocritical actions in terms of our real commitment to a balanced budget. 
What is the significance of having this tax lapse on the 30th of September? The significance is that we are going to count in our budget for the period that will begin October 1, 1997, $6 billion of revenue for the next 10 years, or $60 billion of additional revenue based on the way in which the U.S. Senate scores its legislation. The House, which uses a 5-year rule, is going to score $30 billion of additional revenue because we are allowing this tax to lapse on the 30th of September. 
Mr. President, I know you are a prominent business person and deal with complex financial matters. You say, how can this be? What has actually happened in the last 14 months is, we have lost $5 billion of real revenue. Four percent of the Federal deficit for fiscal year 1997 will be the loss of revenue by allowing this ticket tax to lapse for 10 of the past 14 months. Yet, Mr. President, we are about to set up a process where it is almost guaranteed to lapse again. 
The reason we are doing it is because under our arcane budget rules, if the tax is not in place as of the beginning of the fiscal year, we can assume that it is all fresh, new revenue and therefore we have found $60 billion in order to support other spending or to finance tax reductions. It is no real additional money. In fact, every expectation is there will be less real money because there will be a hiatus in this tax after September 30. 
Why do I feel relatively confident, although sadly so, that there will be a hiatus in this tax after September 30, 1997? The answer is because we have virtually ordained that it shall be. Why have we done so? Because last year we passed an aviation reform bill, and in that bill we provided that the Secretary of Transportation and the Secretary of the Treasury would report to the Congress on their collective recommendations as to what kind of permanent method of taxation we should use for commercial aviation. 
There is a dispute that has broken out between various segments of the commercial aviation industry as to how the tax should be structured. The interesting thing is that we are about to pass a bill in which the tax will expire on September 30. When do you think the report that we have already requested will be submitted to Congress? The answer is in October 1997. So we are not even going to get the report upon which we are supposed to make a judgment until after this tax has expired. 
I suggest we are virtually guaranteeing that we will have yet another lapse in this tax, yet another hole in the trust fund that millions of Americans look to, albeit in a distant, obscure way, but they look to it with hopes that that trust fund will help make their period in the skies above America a safer experience. 
The fact is that we have removed $5 billion of that safety over the last 14 months, and we are about to pass a bill that is virtually guaranteeing that we will remove more of it. And we are doing it solely, in my judgment, in order to be able to create a fictitious $60 billion that we can then use in order to justify other spending--not spending in aviation but spending in any area that we choose to do so, or reduction of taxes. If you want to know why in the last 20 years we have added almost $4.5 trillion to the national debt, you are looking here tonight at an example of the very kind of accounting gamesmanship that has gotten us into our current posture. 
It had been my original intention to offer an amendment to this bill, as I did in the Finance Committee, to extend this bill at least to the end of the calendar year so that we would have an opportunity to consider the October report, make a reasoned judgment, and enact whatever permanent reforms we want to enact without suffering another lapse in revenue. 
However, I recognize at this late hour the chances of such an amendment being successfully considered are nil. I also recognize the importance of getting this tax back in place as rapidly as possible so that we can stop the loss of the $5 billion. 
Now, some might say, isn't it a good idea to have this tax lapse for 10 of the last 14 months. Has that not resulted in a bonanza of savings to American commercial aviation users? The fact is there has been some of that. Some airlines have, in fact, reduced their ticket price by the amount that was represented by the 10-percent tax which is embedded in that price. Others have not done so. So in some instances the American flying consumer has paid the same amount for the ticket but has not received the benefit of investment in the safety of our airways. 
It will be my intention as soon as possible to introduce legislation that will make this tax permanent and will eliminate the `Perils of Pauline' that we have experienced first in August 1996 and now again in February 1997. 
One of the reasons that we are rushing to enact this now is that the train is almost at the `damsel in distress.' The FAA has said that they are in a position now that within the next few weeks, if not days, they will be in a position of having to send out notices to aviation facilities across the country that they cannot meet their obligations because the trust fund will have been depleted. 
For that reason, I do not believe it is prudent to add one additional absurdity on top of the pile of absurdities that are represented by our actions relative to this aviation tax over the last 14 months. I regret that we are taking this action. I am afraid that it casts a pall on our seriousness of commitment to a balanced budget amendment when we have often used the analogy with a balanced budget that it is like a serial killer who has written on the wall, `Stop me before I kill again,' that we need the balanced budget amendment to say, `Stop us before we commit deficit again.' 
Well, this is a good example of why we will need that constitutional amendment because clearly we are not showing that kind of discipline in adopting this legislation tonight. This is not a proud day for the Senate. It is not a happy day for the U.S. taxpayers. I hope that we can indicate to them that they will do better at some future date. 
I thank the Chair.

Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I speak to my colleagues and to the American public today about a quiet crisis that is occurring in our Nation. This is the crisis that has resulted from our failure to adequately invest in the basic services that will render our Nation economically productive, with a strong national security, and prepare the next generation of our citizens to meet their responsibilities. All over our Nation, from the largest cities to the smallest rural communities, we are seeing a deterioration of our basic public support system. Our schools, our bridges, our highways, our water and sewer systems are deteriorating. 
In areas of growth, we do not have enough resources to meet the needs of an expanding population. Too many children are learning in overcrowded and unsafe classrooms. Too many motorists are driving on inadequate roads and highways. Too many communities are being forced to make do with inadequate water, sewer, and environmental systems. 
Our ability to compete in the economy of the future, and to maintain and enhance the quality of life of our citizens, will, in large part, hinge on whether and how we correct those problems. 
As we enter the 21st century, we must build and rebuild the foundations which will serve our people and their needs for years to come. In the near future, I intend to continue the efforts that are underway with my Republican and Democratic colleagues who have expressed similar concerns. Out of this will come legislation which will assist States and local communities to build the schools, roads, and water systems that 
they need now and in the future. 
The numbers tell the story. A recent General Accounting Office report says that one-third of our Nation's school districts have buildings in need of immediate and extensive repair. The same report states that 25 million students go to schools with poor lighting and heating, bad ventilation or air quality, or a lack of physical security; 25 million boys and girls attend schools with those deteriorating conditions. It has been estimated that $150 billion will be needed to remedy this situation. That dollar amount does not include the cost to meet new school construction for expanding populations. 
This affects my State. It affects all of the States of the Nation. The school facility crisis is estimated, for instance, in the State of North Dakota, to cost $450 million to remedy; $5 billion is needed in Texas, $7.5 billion in Florida, $15 billion in New York State, and $20 billion in the State of California. In Louisiana, 88 percent of the 1,500 public schools are in need of repair; 77 percent of Connecticut's more than 1,000 schools need some rehabilitation. In Illinois, 89 percent of more than 4,000 schools need improvement. 
I firmly believe the administration of elementary and secondary education is the responsibility of State and local communities. It is not a Federal responsibility. The Federal Government should restrain itself from interfering with curriculum, personnel and other educational policies. But I believe there is a role for the Federal Government in helping increasingly underfunded and overburdened school districts in the construction of badly needed new schools and the renovation of existing schools. That is a role in which the Federal Government has had some history. 
I recently spent a day working in a rehabilitation project on Opa-Locka Elementary School in Dade County, FL. I was impressed when I looked at the plaque on the wall of Opa-Locka Elementary School, a school which is 60 years old this year. It was built by the U.S. Public Works Administration as a Depression-era job-creation project. The Federal Government has a history of assisting school districts in meeting their capital needs and has done so without the criticism of inappropriate Federal intrusion. 
Mr. President, I applaud the President's proposed school construction initiative. It was one of the 10 points in the education program that he presented to the Nation during his State of the Union Address. He has opened the door to an important Federal-State-local partnership, and we must walk through that door. However, I believe the door needs to be widened. 
Our school construction needs are much greater than the President's proposal would address. States and local school districts need to have a wider range of policy and fiscal options to meet their needs. We must aggressively build on the President's plan so that States and local governments can solve their tremendous needs. 
School construction is obviously not the only capital issue facing States and local governments. For example, the United States has 39 million miles of roads and 574,000 bridges. Recent estimates show that 60 percent of our roads and a third of our bridges are substandard and in need of repair. The U.S. Department of Transportation estimates that we currently invest $35 billion annually in highway construction. This is $15 billion less than is needed to keep up with deterioration and $33 billion less than the amount estimated to keep ahead of growth, change, and congestion. 
Nationally, our water and sewer management investment needs are in excess of $138 billion. 
The key question for us and for America is, how will we face these problems? We must address these problems in a way that is responsible, both to our commitment to a balanced budget and to the needs of States and local communities. It is vital that we find a funding source that is limited, stable and viable over an extended period of time. 
I suggest that some of the principles of this new partnership of the Federal Government with State and local communities in meeting their education, transportation and environmental infrastructure needs would include these: We must form an expanded and long-term partnership. It must be a partnership built on a basic respect for the responsibilities of State and local government to make the key policy decisions. 
It must also be built on a requirement that it be a true partnership with the States and as a condition of participation that they provide a matching source of funds to that which will come from the Federal Government and that they maintain their current level of effort so that this will truly be an additional effort toward meeting our unmet needs, not a substitution for current effort, and that there be maximum flexibility to the States in the form in which they choose to meet those needs and the priorities which they establish. 
I am going to suggest, Mr. President, as we develop these concepts into legislation, that one of the most appealing ways in which to provide that stable and sustainable revenue source in order to be able to form this partnership is to utilize the 4.3 cents per gallon of motor fuels tax which was enacted in 1993 and which goes directly to the Federal Treasury, not as does most other federally imposed motor fuels tax into a highway trust fund. This revenue source is currently generating in excess of $6 billion. 
If States and local communities are willing to provide a substantial match to these funds--and I will suggest that that match should be in the ratio of one-third State and local to two-thirds Federal--the total effect of this Federal contribution for educational, transportation, environmental needs over the next 5 to 10 years could be in excess of $200 billion, if these funds were used as the basis of innovative financing methods. 
Mr. President, this will have the potential of tremendous positive impact on our Nation's economy. Clearly, the economy will benefit by having children who are educated in appropriate environments. The country will benefit by having a transportation system that can meet our current and future needs that will not impose excessive costs due to congestion and inadequacy of facilities. Our Nation will be enhanced by having quality environmental systems that will protect our water and our air and our natural resources. 
Those are some of the benefits. But in addition to those, a program of this scale will provide employment for literally hundreds of thousands of people, as we strive to construct these facilities that will have such positive long-term benefits. 
Mr. President, in the next weeks I expect to continue to work with my colleagues in developing this into specific legislative proposals. 
Our motorists and our Nation's commercial interests need safe, modern, and reliable highways. Our communities deserve responsible water and sewer and other environmental systems. Our children will require the best quality of educational facilities in order to achieve world-class standards of educational performance. We can wait no longer to meet the needs of this quiet crisis of deteriorating infrastructure in America. Now is the time to act. Thank you, Mr. President.

Mr. GRAHAM. I thank the Chair. 
Mr. President, we as a Nation have come to an important crossroads in our history. We must decide whether or not we should alter our supreme and most respected document, the U.S. Constitution, to establish the principle of a balanced Federal budget. 
As we all know, regrettably our Nation is deeply in debt and goes more so each year. The budget deficit has become a permanent fixture of our Nation's fiscal policy. While there are those who say we can without a constitutional amendment balance the budget, recent history raises serious doubts. 
Mr. President, I should like to humanize this issue by putting it in the context of a family, my family. My father was born in Croswell, MI, in 1885--February 10, 1885, to be exact. When he was born, the national debt, after almost 100 years of American history, after having purchased Louisiana from the French, having fought the Revolution, the War of 1812, the Civil War, we had accumulated a total national debt on the day my dad was born of $1.6 billion. If you took the population of the United States in February of 1885 and divided it by that $1.6 billion national debt, my father came into the Earth owing $28. That was his share of the national debt. 
I was born in November 1936. On that date, the national debt was $33.8 billion. Between my dad's birth and my birth, we had fought the Spanish-American War, the First World War, and suffered a deep depression, which we still were in the midst of on the date of my birth. On that day, dividing the then national debt by the then population, I owed $264. That was my indebtedness to the Nation at the time of my arrival. 
My first child was born in January 1963. When Gwen was born, the national debt was $310 billion. In 1963. That was not very long ago in the scale of life. And my daughter owed $1,640. That was her share of the national debt as recently as January of 1963. And 27 years after her birth, my daughter Gwen had a daughter, Sarah. Sarah was born in 1990, and upon her birth the national debt, if you can believe it, had soared from $310 billion 27 years earlier to $3.2 trillion when my first granddaughter, Sarah Logan, was born. Sarah came into this world with a proportion of the national debt of $12,830. 
Since Sarah's birth, I have had seven other grandchildren, the most recent born in 1995. When those four grandchildren, triplet granddaughters and a grandson, Mark Ernest, were born, the national debt had soared again now to $4.9 trillion, or they came into the Earth with a indebtedness of $18,932. 
Between my father's birth, with a $28 indebtedness, to my youngest grandchild's birth, $18,932 per person is what we have inflicted upon our children, our grandchildren, and generations beyond. 
Such history has brought me to the conclusion that if we are to reverse this profligate policy, if we are to begin to return to the principles of our parents and grandparents, we, unlike they, must have the discipline of a constitutional amendment which will require that each generation assume responsibility for its indebtedness. 
I make these observations not without recognition that we have made considerable progress in recent years in terms of gaining some control over our deficit. America reached its all-time high, in terms of an annual deficit, in 1992. In 1992 the national deficit soared to over $290 billion in that one year. It took us 100 years to get to $1.6 billion. In one year we had a deficit of $290 billion. 
This year, the estimate is that our deficit will be $107 billion. So we have made substantial progress and I believe that President Clinton and the Members of Congress during this period deserve some recognition for the fact that we have pulled that line of deficits in a downward position, albeit still, each year, contributing substantially to our accumulated national debt. 
But, despite this progress, current projections forecast large deficits into the future. Our national debt is expected to reach not the $4.9 trillion that it was in 1995, but $5.4 trillion at the end of this fiscal year, by the end of September of 1997. 
With this history in mind, and witnessing numerous attempts--many of which carry the names of Members of Congress--attempts and failures to enact legislation to force ourselves to meet the standard of a balanced budget, I believe the time has come to pass an amendment to the Constitution to mandate a balanced budget. It is unfortunate that we need a constitutional amendment to force us to do something that we ought to do voluntarily. However, a constitutional amendment is necessary to provide Congress and Presidents, today and in the future, with the necessary constitutional backbone to maintain a policy of a balanced budget. 
I have long supported a balanced budget amendment. I am an original cosponsor of the current amendment that is before us this afternoon. I support an amendment as an important principle, both to maintain the momentum of the last 4 years toward reducing and eliminating the annual deficits, and to assure that, once we are at a point of balance, we will stay there. It is imperative that we not let this opportunity pass by, that we not lose the progress of the last 4 years. We must continue on a path toward a balanced Federal budget by the year 2002. 
If I could speak in the context of my State of Florida, we have a unique interest in the outcome of this debate. Florida will continue to grow. It will be one of the fastest growing States in the Nation. Our population, which today is something over 14 million people, is projected to reach over 16 million by the year 2005. The benefits of a balanced budget amendment are national and numerous, but one of the most important benefits, as recognized by virtually all economists, is that a balanced Federal budget will lead to lower interest rates and increased economic growth. 
Americans deserve the benefits that a balanced budget will bring and the people of my State, citizens in a State which each year must finance the consequences of growth--additional homes, schools, all of the things that a growing population requires--with money which has largely been borrowed, will benefit especially by the lower interest rates that a balanced Federal budget will bring. 
If capital is readily available at reduce cost, virtually everything Americans do that involves borrowing money is easier and will have a positive financial impact on States with expanding population, such as Florida. Most States have a constitutional requirement for a balanced budget within their own fiscal houses. As a State legislator, and for 8 years as Governor of Florida, I operated with a balanced budget amendment to our State Constitution and with a balanced budget. I can say from that experience that this requirement of a balanced budget in our State constitution, and the fidelity of generations of State officials to that objective, has served my State well. It will serve America well. I will support the specifics of this amendment because I believe that this specific amendment is better than the status quo, is better than the history of the last century. But I think we should not let this opportunity pass without striving for additional perfection in this amendment.

Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, this morning, I appreciate the opportunity to speak on behalf of an important set of provisions in the Democratic program of putting families first--in this case, the provision that gives families some additional security for their pension and retirement. There is no generation in American history which needs to plan more carefully for their retirement years than that which is currently in America's work force. Two fundamental things have occurred. 
First, people are living longer. One of the great successes of our generation has been its capacity to extend life and extend the quality of life. 
Today a person who retires can look forward to almost 18 years of quality of life after they leave the workplace. 
A second thing that has occurred is tremendous mobility within the work force. Our grandparents had an expectation when they completed their formal education of finding a place of employment and in many instances staying in that one employment for the rest of their work careers. Today people are much more mobile and change their jobs at frequent intervals. 
The chart behind me indicates what has happened just in the last decade in terms of job mobility. To focus on one group of Americans, American males between the ages of 35 and 44, in 1987 the average American male in that middle-age active employment group had been with their current employer for 7.6 years. Less than 10 years later, the average has dropped to 6 years. The same is true of virtually every other category of males and females from the beginning worker to the worker who is on the edge of retirement. 
Workers can no longer expect to spend a career with a single employer. The work force patterns of the last hundred years have evolved as industries, technologies, and the American economy has evolved. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, if you are an average employee between the ages of 18 and 29 you have held 7.6 jobs in that brief work career. On the occasion of a 30th birthday, 40 percent of Americans have been in their current jobs less than 2 years, making it easier for working Americans to successfully save for their retirement in this context of extended age after retirement, and the mobility of the work force is a matter of tremendous national importance. It is obviously important to the individual and their families to be well prepared for those retirement years, but also it has important implications to the communities in which they will live and to the Nation as a whole. 
A retiree who is financially well prepared will not risk being a financial burden to their children, or to State, local, or Federal Government social service providers. They will be able to strengthen the economy in their local communities with home purchases and a variety of leisure and recreation activities. They will be able to use their free time for volunteer efforts to help the next generation with things like the President spoke of in his inaugural address, helping young people to learn to read, building homes for Habitat for Humanity, all the ways in which that discretionary time has served the community and the Nation. 
Financial security retirement is valuable to the retiree. It is valuable to the Nation. 
Our Nation's businesses offer a variety of benefits to their workers to give them a secure retirement to help them start saving for their postemployment life. These range from the traditional defined benefit programs to profit-sharing to 401(k) retirement accounts. I am going to focus on that third area in which employers have assisted their employees in preparing for retirement; that is, through incentives and encouragement to persons to voluntarily save for their own retirement, and how can we make that a more expansive and a more stable source of retirement income. 
Generally, the 401(k) retirement benefits become available to employees after they have worked 5 to 7 years with a particular company. If an employee leaves before that time, some or all of the benefits which they derived can be lost. I applaud the Democratic leadership and specifically Senator Daschle for a legislative response that will greatly assist hard-working Americans in continuing their ability to prepare for their retirement even as they undergo these dramatic changes in their employment career. 
This legislation provides for more rapid vesting for the employer contribution to a 401(k) plan as retirement savings. 401(k) plans have grown tremendously over the past two decades. In 1984, there were 17,300 qualified plans. Today there are over 140,000 such plans. Currently, 22 million American workers contribute part of their salary to a 401(k) plan to help prepare for retirement. In the aggregate, 401(k) plans now hold $675 billion in assets for American workers. 
Employees are contributing large sums to their 401(k) in part because many employers match the employee contribution. But under current law, if an employee terminates his or her employment with a company prior to 5 years of service, then the employee may not get any of the employer's contribution to the plan. In today's mobile work force, many employees switch jobs in less than 5 years. We should recognize this reality of the mobility of the work force. We should recognize that it is a strength of the American economy. We should mitigate the current practice of penalizing mobility at less than 5 years by vesting an employer match after 3 years. That is one of the proposals for reform in the 401(k) program. But faster vesting alone is not enough. We need to explore other proposals that will make it easier on employers to transfer pension funds with an employee when the worker changes jobs. 
As an example, under current law, if a new employer accepts pension funds that came from a new employee's previous company, a worker who has worked at company A, they have accumulated 
savings in their 401(k) plan and they want to carry those funds to their new employer B, the new employer has to make certain that pension funds are part of a plan that meets all the Federal requirements. Failing to do so, they can be subject to Internal Revenue Service penalties. Many businesses, particularly small businesses, would like to let employees bring pension funds with them, but the regulatory hassle makes it not worthwhile. We need to assure employers that if they allow an employee to roll over his or her old pension plan to carry it with them to their new point of employment, that the new employer will not risk IRS penalties. 
Mr. President, 5 million American workers participate in retirement savings plans and change jobs every year. Some will be completely vested and have a smooth transition. Some will put themselves, their family and their retirement security at risk by losing a portion of the company's matching contributions. 
Mr. President, the next chart indicates the percentage distribution of worker by years of tenure in their current job. For instance, for American workers in the 35 to 44 age group, 14.7 percent have been in their current employment for less than 1 year, 29 percent for less than 4 years, which means that 29 percent of Americans within that age group would not be in a status in which an employer contribution to their retirement would be mandatory vesting. This issue of making it more secure for employers to be able to provide a continuation of retirement benefits to their new employee, to give the new employee a greater assurance that their contribution and the employer contribution upon which they counted will be there when they reach retirement, are critical issues to the large population of Americans who will increasingly be looking to their own efforts in order to provide for their retirement years. 
Mr. President, this planning for retirement will make a difference in the lives of millions of Americans today and in the future and in the communities in which they live. If we take steps today to secure the pension and retirement benefits of Americans, we will be making a contribution to the well-being of those families, communities, and the Nation. 
I commend the leadership for having brought this important issue to such a level of priority in this 105th Congress and urge all of my colleagues to give it the appropriate consideration and support for the security of American families. 
I thank the Chair.
