   Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, I rise today to thank my colleagues for supporting Kristen's Act. Representative SUE MYRICK  introduced this essential crime prevention legislation on the House side, and I introduced the Senate companion. With the Senate's action today, this measure will be set to become law. I am grateful to Representative MYRICK for her tireless efforts towards ensuring that Kristen's Act becomes law. The legislation will help public agencies and nonprofit organizations provide desperately needed assistance to law enforcement and families in locating involuntarily missing adults. 
   I would also like to thank Senators LEAHY and HATCH. They deserve special praise for their constant support of victim advocacy initiatives and their fight to put a stop to crime in our Nation. 
   Kristen's Law was inspired by the story of a young woman from North Carolina, Kristen Modafferi. On June 23, 1997, just three weeks after her 18th birthday, Kristen disappeared. Despite tireless efforts by law enforcement to locate Kristen, she has not been seen since. And tragically, the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children was unable to assist with the search, all because Kristen had passed the age of 18. 
   Unfortunately, Kristen's story is not unique. Numerous other cases involving the disappearance of young adults are reported to authorities every year. During 1999, in North Carolina, the Mecklenburg County Sheriff's Office received reports of 132 missing persons ages 18 through 21. That's the number for just one age group, in just one county, in just one state in the country. When we look at nationwide statistics for missing adults, what we find is staggering. For example, as of February 1999, the FBI reported that there were more than 38,000 active missing person entries for adults over the age of eighteen. This is frighteningly large number. 
   That is why I believe that Kristen's Act is a necessary protective measure. It will not only provide some comfort to the millions of parents who send their children to college every year and worry about their safety, but it will help ensure that when an adult of any age is determined missing due to foul play, a national effort will be mobilized to help. 
   When a person involuntarily disappears, time is of the essence. Search efforts must begin quickly, and they must reach across jurisdictions. Abducted individuals are often taken across state lines. In order to effectively coordinate a search, the groups conducting the search must have an easy way to share information with each other, no matter how far away from one another they may be. Kristen's Act will help facilitate communication between search parties through the establishment of a national database to track involuntarily missing adults. 
   The greater the number of agencies helping in the search, the more likely it is that the person will be found. But there is no central organization that exists to aid law enforcement in their efforts to locate missing adults. Unfortunately, Kristen's tragic story illustrates the need for such an organization. Kristen's Act will help enable this to happen by providing funds to help establish a national clearinghouse for missing adults. 
   Mr. President, I believe that it is important to mention that it is true that some individuals may disappear because they want to. Some of these individuals may live in abusive households. Others may want to start a new life. And because they are considered legal adults, they have the choice to remain missing. In these cases, it may not make sense of law enforcement, the Center, or anyone else to launch a search. 
   That is why I believe the Attorney General should ensure that under Kristen's Act, grants will be given out only to organizations that have demonstrated they have in place clear, effective methods of distinguishing between disappearances that are voluntary and those that may involve foul play. And that is why Kristen's Act specifies that if a national database is set up, it will be used to track only those missing adults who have first been determined by law enforcement to be endangered due to age, diminished mental capacity or suspicious circumstances. 
   There are many individuals who really do need help. In those instances, Kristen's Act sends a message to families that they deserve whatever assistance is necessary to locate endangered and involuntarily missing loved ones. The bill will help ensure that all involuntarily missing adults--regardless of age--will receive not only the benefit of search efforts by law enforcement, but also by experienced, specialized organizations. 
   Mr. President, I believe we must do everything we can to prevent situations like the one that Kristen Modafferi and her family have suffered through. The bill we passed today goes a long way toward achieving this goal. Again, I commend my colleagues for recognizing its importance.

   Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, I rise to introduce legislation to promote the development of affordable, quality rental housing for low-income households in rural areas. I am pleased, along with Senator JEFFORDS and Senator LEAHY, to introduce the ``Rural Rental Housing Act of 2000.'' 
   There is a pressing and worsening need for quality rental housing for rural families and senior citizens. As a group, residents of rural communities are the worst housed of all our citizens. Rural areas contain approximately 20 percent of the nation's population as compared to suburbs with 50 percent. Yet, twice as many rural American families live in bad housing than in the suburbs. An estimated 2,600,000 rural households live in substandard housing with severe structural damage or without indoor plumbing, heat, or electricity. 
   Substandard housing is a particularly grave problem in the rural areas of my home state of North Carolina. Ten percent or more of the population in five of North Carolina's rural counties live in substandard housing. Rural housing units, in fact, comprise 60 percent of all substandard units in the state. 
   Even as millions of rural Americans live in wretched rental housing, millions more are paying an extraordinarily high price for their housing. One out of every three renters in rural America pays more than 30 percent of his or her income for housing; 20 percent of rural renters pay more than 50 percent of their income for housing. 
   Most distressing is when people living in housing that does not have heat or indoor plumbing pay an extraordinary amount of their income in rent. Over 90 percent of people living in housing in the worst conditions pay more than 50 percent of their income for housing costs. 
   Unfortunately, our rural communities are not in a position to address these problems alone. They are disproportionately poor and have fewer resources to bring to bear on the issue. Poverty is a crushing, persistent problem in rural America. One-third of the non-metropolitan counties in North Carolina have 20 percent or more of their population living below the poverty line. In contrast, not a single metropolitan county in North Carolina has 20 percent or more of its population living below the poverty line. Not surprisingly, the economies of rural areas are generally less diverse, limiting jobs and economic opportunity. Rural areas have limited access to many forces driving the economy, such as technology, lending, and investment, because they are remote and have low population density. Banks and other investors, looking for larger projects with lower risk, seek metropolitan areas for loans and investment. Credit in rural areas is often more expensive and available at less favorable terms than in metropolitan areas. 
   Given the magnitude of this problem, it is startling to find that the federal government is turning its back on the situation. In the face of this challenge, the federal government's investment in rural rental housing is at its lowest  level in more than 25 years. Federal spending for rural rental housing has been cut by 73 percent since 1994. Rural rental housing unit production financed by the federal government has been reduced by 88 percent since 1990. Moreover, poor rural renters do not fair as well as poor urban renters in accessing existing programs. Only 17 percent of very low-income rural renters receive housing subsidies, compared with 28 percent of urban poor. Rural counties fared worse with Federal Housing Authority assistance on a per capita basis, as well, getting only $25 per capita versus $264 in metro areas. Our veterans in rural areas are no better off: Veterans Affairs housing dollars are spent disproportionately in metropolitan areas. 
   To address the scarcity of rural rental housing, I believe that the federal government must come up with new solutions. We cannot simply throw money at the problem and expect the situation to improve. Instead, we must work in partnership with State and local governments, private financial institutions, private philanthropic institutions, and the private and nonprofit sectors to make headway. We must leverage our resources wisely to increase the supply and quality of rural rental housing for low-income households and the elderly. 
   Senator JEFFORDS, Senator LEAHY, and I are proposing a new solution. Today, we introduce the Rural Rental Housing Act of 2000 to create a flexible source of financing to allow project sponsors to build, acquire or rehabilitate rental housing based on local needs. We demand that the federal dollars to be stretched by requiring State matching funds and by requiring the sponsor to find additional sources of funding for the project. We are pleased that over 70 housing groups from 26 states have already indicated their support for this legislation. 
   Let me briefly describe what the measure would do. We propose a $250 million fund to be administered by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA). The funds will be allotted to states based on their shares of rural substandard units and of the rural population living in poverty. We will leverage federal funding by requiring states or other non-profit intermediaries to provide a dollar-for-dollar match of project funds. The funds will be used for the acquisition, rehabilitation, and construction of low-income rural rental housing. 
   The USDA will make rental housing available for low-income populations in rural communities. The population served must earn less than 80 percent area median income. Housing must be in rural areas with populations not exceeding 25,000, outside of urbanized areas. Priority for assistance will be given to very low income households, those earning less than 50 percent of area median income, and in very low-income communities or in communities with a severe lack of affordable housing. To ensure that housing continues to serve low-income populations, the legislation specifies that housing financed under the legislation must have a low-income use restriction of not less than 30 years. 
   The Act promotes public-private partnerships to foster flexible, local solutions. The USDA will make assistance available to public bodies, Native American tribes, for-profit corporations, and private nonprofit corporations with a record of accomplishment in housing or community development. Again, it stretches federal assistance by limiting most projects from financing more than 50 percent of a project cost with this funding. The assistance may be made available in the form of capital grants, direct, subsidized loans, guarantees, and other forms of financing for rental housing and related facilities. 
   Finally, the Act will be administered at the state level by organizations familiar with the unique needs of each state rather than creating a new federal bureaucracy. The USDA will be encouraged to identify intermediary organizations based in the state to administer the funding provided that it complies with the provisions of the Act. These intermediary organizations can be states or state agencies, private nonprofit community development corporations, nonprofit housing corporations, community development loan funds, or community development credit unions. 
   This Act is not meant to replace, but to supplement the Section 515 Rural Rental Housing program, which has been the primary source of federal funding for affordable rental housing in rural America from its inception in 1963. Section 515, which is administered by the USDA's Rural Housing Service, makes direct loans to non-profit and for-profit developers to build rural rental housing for very low income tenants. Our support for 515 has decreased in recent years--there has been a 73 percent reduction since 1994--which has had two effects. It is practically impossible to build new rental housing, and our ability to preserve and maintain the current stock of Section 515 units is hobbled. Fully three-quarters of the Section 515 portfolio is more than 20 years old. Currently $60 million of the $115 million appropriation in fiscal year 2000 is used to preserve existing stock. 
   The time has come for us to take a new look at a critical problem facing rural America. How can we best work to promote the development of quality rental housing for low-income people in rural America? My colleagues and I believe that to answer this question, we must comply with certain basic principles. We do not want to create yet another program with a large federal bureaucracy. We want a program that is flexible, that fosters public-private partnerships, that leverages federal funding, and that is locally controlled. We believe that the Rural Rental Housing Act of 2000 satisfies these principles and will help move us in the direction of ensuring that everyone in America, including those in rural areas, have access to affordable, quality housing options.

   Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Law Enforcement Officers Due Process Act of 2000. Every day our Nation's police officers put their lives on the line in the fight against crime. Every time they patrol a beat they put their own safety at risk to protect our children and make our country a better place to live and work. We all owe a great deal to these brave men and women. 
   Working police officers spend their lives among the public safeguarding the innocent and apprehending those who have committed crimes. Much of this contact can be stressful for everyone involved. Perhaps an individual has been stopped by an officer for the suspected violation of a law. Or maybe the officer is assisting someone who is the victim of a crime. Due to the circumstances, these are often unpleasant situations. And unfortunately, in some instances, contact with the police officer may become adversarial and generate complaints about the officer's actions. 
   These complaints range from accusations that an officer took too long to arrive at a crime scene, used too much force, or was not forceful enough, to claims that the officer was rude or didn't show proper respect. Some complaints against officers are legitimate. However, some complaints are generated to intimidate an officer who is simply doing his or her job, into dropping charges. Any one of these complaints can get an officer fired, suspended, or otherwise punished without the benefit of due process. 
   A patchwork of state and local laws currently governs the rights of officers when they are involved in a case that may lead to dismissal, demotion, suspension or transfer. Thirty-five states have state and/or local laws in place that govern the administrative due process rights of law enforcement officers. However, 15 states do not have any of these much-deserved due process protections for their law enforcement officers. 
   The Law Enforcement Officers Due Process Act is a common-sense measure designed to replace arbitrary and ad hoc investigatory procedures with consistent standards. The legislation will provide additional funding to law enforcement agencies that either have in place, or currently do not have but certify they will implement, administrative due process for their law enforcement officers. An agency will be eligible for grant money if its administrative procedures include the right of a law enforcement officer under investigation to: (1) a hearing before a fair and impartial board or hearing officer; (2) be represented by an attorney or other officer at the expense of the officer under investigation; (3) confront any witness testifying against him or her; and (4) record all meetings he or she attends. In many instances, an employer with direct control over an officer is also the investigator. That is why providing basic, explicitly stated rights to officers under investigation is crucial to maintaining impartial investigations. These rights will not interfere with the management of state and local internal investigations. They will merely ensure that officers receive the benefit of fair and objective investigations, whether a complaint against them is legitimate or not. 
   Some individuals may be concerned that providing these rights would delay removal of an officer who is ultimately found to have deserved disciplinary action taken against them. However, I'd like to emphasize that my legislation would not prevent the immediate suspension of an officer whose continued presence on the job is considered to be a substantial and immediate threat to the welfare of the law enforcement agency or the public; who refuses to obey a direct order issued in conformance with the agency's rules and regulations; or who is accused of committing an illegal act. 
   The Law Enforcement Officers Due Process Act does not force a law enforcement agency to implement due process rights for its officers. Rather, it encourages agencies to do the right thing by offering them additional funds if they establish written procedures for determining if a complaint is valid or merely designed to cause trouble for the officer. 
   I urge my colleagues who represent states that do not have law enforcement officers' due process rights laws to cosponsor my bill and give their police officers the protections they deserve. I also urge my colleagues who represent states that have various local laws in place to cosponsor my bill. By doing so they will help eliminate the disparity that exists among local jurisdictions, and guarantee that every single officer in their state will have a minimum baseline of rights to help guarantee fair and impartial investigations. 
   Crime rates are down across the Nation. We owe a tremendous debt of gratitude to our Nation's police officers for helping make this happen. Our communities, our schools, and our places of business would not enjoy the level of security they have today without the efforts of law enforcement. Enacting the Law Enforcement Officers Due Process Act is the least we can do to show officers that we will fight for all of them just like they fight for all of us every day.

   Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, how would you feel if someone was eavesdropping on your private phone conversations without your knowledge? Well, if it happened to me, I would be very disturbed. And I think that most Americans would be very disturbed to know that something similar may be happening every time they use their computers. 
   The shocking fact is that many software programs contain something called spyware. Spyware is computer code that surreptitiously uses our Internet connection to transmit information about things like our purchasing patterns and our health and financial status. This information is collected without our knowledge or explicit permission and the spyware programs run undetected while you surf the Internet. 
   Spyware has been found in Quicken software, which is manufactured by Intuit, Inc. So let me use this as an example. Imagine you purchase Quicken software or download it from the Internet. You install it on your computer to help you with your finances. However, unbeknownst to you, Quicken does more than install financial planning tools on your computer. It also installs a little piece of spyware. The spyware lies dormant until one day when you get on the Internet. 
   As you start surfing the Internet, the spyware sends back information to Intuit about what you buy and what you are interested in. And all of this happens without your knowledge. You could be on Amazon.com or researching health issues and at the very same time Intuit spyware is using your Internet connection, transmitting some of your most private data to someone you never heard of. 
   In the months since it was reported that Quicken contained spyware, the folks at Intuit may have decided to remove the spyware from Quicken. However, Quicken is not the only software program that may contain spyware. One computer expert recently found spyware programs in popular children's software that is designed to help them learn, such as Mattel Interactive's Reader Rabbit and Arthur's Thinking Games. And, according to another expert's assessment, spyware is present in four hundred software programs, including commonly used software such as RealNetworks RealDownload, Netscape/AOL Smart Download, and NetZip Download Demon. Spyware in these software programs can transmit information about every file you download from the Internet. 
   I rise today to introduce the Spyware Control and Privacy Protection Act of 2000. I believe that this legislation will help Americans regain some control over their personal information and will help stop the loss of their privacy and the privacy of their families. 
   My proposal is common-sense and simple. It incorporates all four fair information practices of notice, choice, access and security--practices that I believe are essential to effective computer privacy legislation. 
   First, the Act requires that any software that contains spyware must provide consumers with clear and conspicuous notice--at the time the software is installed--that the software contains spyware. The notice must also describe the information that the spyware will collect and indicate to whom it will be transmitted. 
   Another critical provision of my bill requires that software users must first give their affirmative consent before the spyware is enabled and allowed to start obtaining and sharing users' personal information with third parties. In other words, software users must ``opt-in'' to the collection and transmission of their information. My bill gives software users a choice whether they will allow the spyware to collect and share their information. 
   The Spyware Control and Privacy Protection Act allows for some common-sense exceptions to the notice and opt-in requirements. Under my proposal, software users would not have to receive notice and give their permission to enable the spyware if the software user's information is gathered in order to provide technical support for use of the software. In addition, users' information may be collected if it is necessary to determine if they are licensed users of the software. And finally, the legislation would not apply to situations where employers are using spyware to monitor Internet usage by their employees. I believe that this last issue is a serious one and deserves to be addressed in separate legislation. 
   Another important aspect of the Spyware Control and Privacy Protection Act is that it would incorporate the fair information practice known as ``access.'' What this means is that an individual software user would have the ability to find out what information has been collected about them, and would be given a reasonable chance to correct any errors. 
   And finally, the fourth fair information practice guaranteed by my bill is ``security.'' Anyone that uses spyware to collect information about software users must establish procedures to keep that information confidential and safe from hackers. 
   Spyware is a modern day Trojan horse. You install software on your computer thinking it's designed to help you, and it turns out that something else is hidden inside that 
   may be quite harmful. 
   I have been closely following the privacy debate for some time now. And I am struck by how often I discover new ways in which our privacy is being eroded. Spyware is among the more startling examples of how this erosion is occurring. 
   Most people would agree that modern technology has been extraordinarily beneficial. It has enabled us to obtain information more quickly and easily than ever before. And companies have streamlined their processes for providing goods and services. 
   But these remarkable developments can have a startling downside. They have made it easier to track personal information such as medical and financial records, and buying habits. In  turn, our ability to keep our personal information private is being eroded. 
   Even sophisticated computer software users are unlikely to be aware that information is being collected about their Internet surfing habits and is likely being fed into a growing personal profile maintained at a data warehouse. They don't know that companies can and do extract the information from the warehouse to create a so-called cyber-profile of what they are likely to buy, what the status of their health may be, what their family is like, and what their financial situation may be. 
   I believe that in the absence of government regulation, it is difficult, if not impossible for people to control the use of their own personal information. Consumers are not properly informed, and businesses are under no legal obligation to protect consumers' privacy. 
   I believe that the Spyware Control and Privacy Protection Act is a reasonable way to help Americans regain some of their privacy. My legislation does not prevent software manufacturers from using their software to collect a consumer's online information. However, it gives back some control to the consumer by allowing him or her to decide whether their information may be gathered. 
   My bill protects consumer privacy, while enabling software companies and marketing firms to continue obtaining consumers' information if the consumer so chooses. Confidence in these companies will be enhanced if they are able to assure their customers that they will not collect their personal information without their permission. 
   Privacy protections should not stop with computer software. I am also proud to be a cosponsor of the Consumer Privacy Protection Act, a much-needed measure that would prevent Internet service providers, individual web sites, network advertisers, and other third parties from gathering information about our online surfing habits without our permission. 
   And last fall, I introduced the Telephone Call Privacy Act in order to prevent phone companies from disclosing consumers' private phone records without their permission. Although there are only a few weeks left in this congressional session, it is my hope that Congress will pass meaningful privacy legislation soon. 
   Increasingly, technology is impacting our lives and the lives of our families. I believe that while it is important to encourage technological growth, we must also balance new developments with our fundamental right to privacy. Otherwise, we may wake up one day and realize that our privacy has been so thoroughly eroded that it is impossible to recover. 
   I urge my colleagues to support the Spyware Control and Privacy Protection Act.

   Mr. EDWARDS. I want to associate my self with the concern expressed by the Senator from Arkansas. Panda Energy has a major gas-fired co-generator in northwestern North Carolina. That plant, in Roanoke Rapids, was the first project completed by this corporation and has been a significant supplier of electricity to the citizens of my state for the past ten years. 
   I, too, have been briefed about the difficulties Panda has faced in their effort to improve China's electricity-generating infrastructure. The commitment to approve and issue a formal tariff to the Panda Project in Luannan County, that the municipal and provincial governments agreed to, is not being honored. By failing to honor their commitment to grant a reasonable tariff rate, these governments have precluded the commercial generation of power. If this continues, the U.S. bondholders will have no choice but to foreclose on what represents the first U.S. capital markets power project financing in China. 
   This is a difficult situation for both sides, but the bottom line is that the international trading system breaks down if agreements are not honored, especially for large infrastructure projects like this one with long lead times. People invest money based on these agreements. They put their companies at risk. 
   I would like to yield to my colleague, Senator KERRY, who has been working on this issue for some time.

   Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, I am pleased that today we are discussing some of the vacancies that exist in the Federal judiciary. There was a discussion this morning about an issue that is near and dear to my heart and important to the folks in North Carolina, which is the vacancies on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit. 
   Senator ROBB came down and discussed Judge Gregory's nomination. Chairman HATCH responded. I would like to say a few words about that discussion. 
   There are 15 authorized judgeships on the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals. There are presently only 10 active judges on that court. By tradition, my State of North Carolina, which is the largest, most populous State in the Fourth Circuit, is allocated three of those judgeships. Out of those 10 judgeships --presently active judges on the Fourth Circuit--how many come from North Carolina? None. 
   We are the only State in the nation that is not represented on a Federal circuit court, along with Hawaii. We are the largest State in the circuit. We have the largest population in the circuit, and we don't have a judge representing our State on this court. That has been true since Judge Ervin died in 1999. 
   The people of North Carolina, who have cases regularly heard in the Fourth Circuit, have no one there representing them. In addition, to the extent the court is regularly interpreting matters of North Carolina law, which it is required to do in diversity cases, there is no judge in this court who is trained in North Carolina law. Now, this Congress recognized some time ago how important it was for States to be represented on their circuit courts of appeal by enacting a law--in fact, requiring that States have a judge on their Federal circuit court of appeals. We have none. As I indicated before, along with Hawaii, we are the only two States in the country that are not represented on our circuit court of appeals. 
   Now, Chairman HATCH had some discussion this morning about Judge Gregory and his nomination to the Fourth Circuit in the State of Virginia, and the fact that that was a slot traditionally allocated to my State of North Carolina. 
   My question to Chairman HATCH is: What are we doing about the nomination of Judge Wynn? Judge Wynn is a very well-respected, very moderate, centrist jurist from North Carolina, who has been nominated for over a year from my State to fill a vacancy that is traditionally allocated to North Carolina. There is no question that Judge Wynn would be approved by this  body if he ever got a hearing and a vote on the floor. 
   Unfortunately, that has not happened. It is easy to understand why the Clinton administration believed they needed to take some action. That action has turned out to be to nominate Judge Gregory. I have to admit it was somewhat frustrating to me, representing North Carolina, to have Judge Gregory nominated for the slot he was nominated for because it was traditionally allocated to North Carolina. But, I do support Judge Gregory's nomination. 
   In addition to having no judge from North Carolina being on the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals, our court does not presently have, nor has it ever had, an African American judge. The Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals has the largest African American population in the country and does not now have, nor has it ever had, an African American judge. Obviously, there is a huge part of our population in the Fourth Circuit that has never been represented on this court. They are entitled to representation by a well-qualified judge. 
   In fact, Judge Wynn who was nominated over a year ago--from my State that has no judge on the Fourth Circuit--is also an African American judge. I urge Chairman HATCH to grant Judge Wynn a hearing and to push forward his vote on the floor of this Senate where he will be approved. 
   The bottom line is that Judge Gregory is a well-respected and well-qualified African American lawyer from the State of Virginia who also deserves a hearing, and also deserves a vote in this body this year. 
   The argument that is made--and Chairman HATCH made it this morning--is we only need 10 judges on the Fourth Circuit, we don't really need the 15 that Congress in fact has authorized. The reason is that the chief judge of that circuit, Judge Wilkinson, says they do not need any more judges, they are operating perfectly efficiently. 
   I point out several things. 
   No. 1, the Fourth Circuit issues more one-sentence opinions than any Federal circuit court in the country. Litigants come before it and make their case. Instead of getting a reasoned decision about why they won or lost their case, they get one sentence. What does that tell them about how much attention in fact is being paid to their case? 
   This same argument was made when there were 13 judges on the court. Now we are down to l0. 
   Since when do we let the chief judge of the circuit court decide how many judges go on the court? That is a function we in Congress have responsibility for--not him. 
   You can certainly make an argument that this is a partisan decision that the chief judge has made--that he likes the present composition of the court. He was a Republican-nominated judge.

   Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, here we have the chief judge, who is a Republican-nominated judge, and a court that now has a majority of Republican judges. You can certainly make the argument that he likes the composition of the court the way it is; he never wants that to be changed. 
   That is so fundamentally wrong and so fundamentally different from the way our Constitution provides. We should be nominating judges. Whether it is a Democratic or a Republican administration, it shouldn't make any difference in nominating well-qualified judges. This body should act on the qualification of those men and women to serve on the court, not based upon the Republican or Democratic composition of the court. It is just that simple. This should be totally nonpartisan. 
   My State has no one representing them on the Fourth Circuit. There is not, nor has there ever been, an African American judge on this court. 
   The simple bottom line is that we have the responsibility of deciding how many judges should be authorized for that court. We have made that decision--15. It is now down to 10. Of those 10, North Carolina has none. The people of North Carolina are entitled 
   to be represented on this court. 
   In addition to that, we should deal with the issue that there has never been an African American judge on this court. 
   We presently have pending the nomination of two well-respected and very well qualified African American jurists. 
   This is what I would say to the Chairman HATCH. Let us have a hearing on Judge Wynn. Let Judge Wynn have a vote on the floor of this Senate, and let the people of North Carolina have what, by law enacted by this body, they are entitled to, which is a judge representing them on their Federal court of appeals so that when my people go to the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals to have their case heard, they have at least one judge representing them on that court. Aren't they entitled to that? 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, I rise today in support of Senator HATCH's resolution commemorating our Olympic athletes for the spirit, enthusiasm and patriotism they displayed in Sydney at the XXVII Summer Games. I am proud to represent a state that sent to Sydney two of the nation's most recognizable athletes, Marion Jones and Mia Hamm, as well as numerous other athletes who valiantly competed in these Olympic games. 
   The nation's eyes were on Marion Jones as she set out to win an unprecedented five gold medals in Sydney. While Marion didn't win five golds, she made us all proud with her commanding performance. She set a track and field record by winning more medals in a single Olympics than any other woman in history. Her three gold and two bronze medals have put Marion atop the track and field world. More important than winning her events, Marion accepted each of her medals with grace and style, epitomizing what Olympic competition is all about. 
   Mia Hamm has captivated children and adults alike with her charisma and passion for the game of soccer. Thousands of girls across North Carolina take to the soccer fields in hopes of being the next Mia Hamm. Watching Mia play in Sydney, I understand why. In the women's soccer semifinals against Brazil, Mia was pushed, shoved and thrown to the ground time and time again. She did not once complain, letting her actions speak louder than words by scoring the only goal of the match. The United States Women's Soccer team went on to claim the silver medal, led by other Tar Heels such as goal keeper Siri Mullinix of Greensboro and Carla Overbeck of Chapel Hill. 
   I am also extremely proud of other North Carolinians who competed in Sydney. While these athletes haven't received the attention Mia Hamm and Marion Jones have, they are equally important and should be commended for their accomplishments. Robert Costello of Southern Pines competed in equestrian events. Tim Montgomery and Jerome Young, both of Raleigh, Lynda Blutreich of Chapel Hill and Melissa Morrison of Kannapolis competed in track and field. Charlie Ogletree of Columbia competed in sailing. Rich DeSelm of Charlotte swam in Sydney. Calvin Brock of Charlotte represented the United States in boxing. George Hincapie and Fred Rodriguez both of Charlotte competed in cycling. Hunter Kemper of Charlotte competed in the triathlon and Henry Nuzum of Chapel Hill competed in rowing. 
   The United States should be proud of every athlete who competed in the Olympics. I am especially proud of the North Carolinians who represented the United States in Sydney, and I am pleased to support this resolution with them in mind.

   Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President I rise today in support of H.R. 4444, which would grant Permanent Normal Trade Relations to China. I do so only after long and careful consideration of this proposal. 
   I believe that granting permanent normal trade relations with China is the right thing to do. It will significantly alter our nation's relations with China. Trade between U.S. companies and the Chinese will likely explode in the coming years--generating jobs and revenues in this country. It could easily be the keystone in the continuing prosperity of this nation. And it could be the vital catalyst for democracy and a free-market system in China. 
   During the last few months as I have traveled through North Carolina and met with my constituents, I have heard from hundreds of men and women who believe that their future prosperity and their jobs turn upon this vote. Many of them eagerly support this legislation. 
   I believe that North Carolina workers can compete with anyone and win. This bill opens a world of opportunity to North Carolina businesses and workers. The farmer, the high- tech worker, the furniture manufacturer, the factory worker, and the banker all will get a real chance to capture a part of the Chinese market. 
   The farmer who is working so hard and struggling believes that China's agricultural market will be opened. For example, China already imports 12 percent of its poultry meat. If China joins the WTO, it will cut its poultry tariffs in half and accept all poultry meat that is certified wholesome by the USDA. A similar situation holds for pork and tobacco products. China's agreement to lower its tariffs, to eliminate quotas, and to defer to U.S. health standards provides North Carolina farmers with real opportunity. 
   The high- tech worker who is producing software or fiber optics cable will also benefit. China has agreed to eliminate its duties on these products in the next few years and has agreed to eliminate many of its purchase and distribution rules that inhibit sales of U.S. products.  
   Meanwhile, tariffs on furniture will be eliminated. Tariffs on heavy machinery will be reduced by nearly one half. Banks and insurance companies will be able to do business with the Chinese people without arbitrary restrictions. The list goes on. 
   As U.S. goods and services flow into China and as our engagement grows, the opportunity for real change in China grows. We are all aware that China has a long way to go in improving its record on human rights, religious liberty, environmental protection and labor rights. The abuses in that nation are serious. And I am committed to continued efforts to end those abuses. As American ideas, goods, and businesses surge into China, I believe China's record will improve. 
   But I am mindful that globalization and this bill in particular may have a real downside. As a Senator from North Carolina, I am well-positioned to see both the enormous benefits and the large costs of this measure. 
   Textile and apparel workers, many of whom live in North Carolina, face real challenges as a result of this measure. While in almost every respect the agreement with China benefits our country, textiles is the major exception. As a result of joining WTO, quotas on Chinese textiles and apparel will be eliminated in 
   2005. As a result, Chinese apparel will flow into the United States. By and large, the Chinese imports will likely displace imports from other countries. However, there is no doubt that an additional burden will be placed on the textile industry. To be sure, the industry can try to protect itself through the anti-surge mechanism put in place by this legislation. Yet it does us no good to pretend that these remedies are perfect and that people will not be hurt. I know that textile workers will work their hearts out competing with the Chinese. I know these people; I grew up with them. When I was in college, I worked a summer job in a textile mill. My father spent his life working in mills. The impact of PNTR on them is personal to me. Dealing with the impact of this bill on them will always be a top priority for me. And I will fight throughout my career to protect them. 
   Mr. President, China's entry into the World Trade Organization and its attainment of permanent normal trade relations with America is not without its risks. No one can predict with certainty that China will live up to its commitments. I vote for this bill because I believe that we must turn our face toward the future. But we must be mindful of the risks. So I warn that I will monitor China's compliance with its agreements like a hawk. If they renege, I will lead the charge to force them to live up to their obligations. 
   But to vote against this measure--to deny PNTR--not only fails to accomplish anything productive but also denies us enormous opportunities. We cannot hide our heads in the sand. China will join the WTO. The Senate has no impact on that decision. The only question we face is whether the U.S. will grant China permanent normal trade relations or whether it will fall out of compliance with its WTO obligations. If we fall out of compliance, the U.S. will be denied the Chinese tariff reductions and rule changes, while every other country in the world takes advantage of the Chinese concessions. We must decide whether the U.S. will be able to compete with other countries--Germany, France, Japan--as they enter the Chinese market. American companies and workers deserve the right to enter those markets. On balance, I believe that China's admission into the World Trade Organization and its attainment of permanent normal trading relations is for the good. 
   And so I vote for this legislation, mindful of the risks, prepared to watch the results carefully and optimistic about the future.

   Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, few North Carolinians will forget September 16, 1999. Almost 1 year ago tomorrow, Hurricane Floyd dumped 20 inches on the State of North Carolina, eastern North Carolina, devastating and forever changing our State. Fifty-two North Carolinians were killed as a result of Hurricane Floyd; 66 counties, which is more than 70 percent of our State, were declared disaster areas. More than 60,000 homes were destroyed or damaged, and hundreds of businesses were forced to close or relocate. Farmers were faced with sometimes the most difficult circumstances they had ever faced in their lives, losing everything for which they had worked. 
   I have been to the floor many times over the course of the last year in an effort to secure relief for our Hurricane Floyd victims. I have worked closely with my colleagues, Senator HELMS from North Carolina and Members of our House delegation, to get help for our folks who are hurting so badly. I have emphasized over and over that what we do or sometimes what we don't do affects real people's lives, the people who often are in very difficult places--for example, the people who were devastated by Hurricane Floyd. 
   Last year, the Senate appropriated more than $2 billion for FEMA's disaster relief account. Of that total, more than $215 million was set aside for FEMA's Hazard Mitigation Grant Program. To this day, more than 2,000 homes in North Carolina have been purchased and families have moved out of harm's way, out of the flood zone. In fact, just yesterday I spoke with Brenda Johnson to tell her that her buyout had been approved. Brenda had been living in a small apartment for almost a year. Finally, she will now be able to move on. Along with the buyout money we appropriated last year, we also secured individual family grants and other disaster relief programs to help people whose homes had been wiped out, people such as Edna Simmons of Greenville, NC. 
   Greenville was actually one of the hardest hit areas struck by Hurricane Floyd. Unfortunately, Edna's home was one of thousands that were overwhelmed by the flood. For days, Edna's home sat under more than 4 1/2 feet of flood water. She lost everything, and she and her husband and her 6-year-old daughter had to start over. At first, they were able to move in with her mother. Then, with the help of her fellow church members, volunteers, using her own savings and a grant from FEMA, she was able to rebuild her home. Repairs are now in the final stages of her home. Now, more than a year after the rain drove them away, Edna and her family are finally on the verge of going back home. 
   This storm, however, did not just destroy homes; it also destroyed entire communities. The small town of Princeville is a great example. It was completely wiped out. Princeville residents lost their townhall; they lost their library, their police station, and their school. Of the 2,000 homes in Princeville, more than 1,000 were heavily damaged or destroyed. And Princeville residents are a very proud group. This is the first town in America that was established by freed slaves. Princeville's residents are working very hard to rebuild and preserve their historic town. 
   One year after the Princeville Montessori school was devastated by the floods, volunteers, State employees, students, and parents have rebuilt the school with the help of FEMA grants. 
   For all the successes we have had over the last year, there are still shortcomings in responding to this disaster. We have heard over and over--I and my staff--from worried and confused constituents, folks who had no idea where they were supposed to go. 
   Navigating the myriad programs that exist in the Federal Government to provide relief to hurricane victims is a time-consuming and sometimes very frustrating process. For example, there are Federal disaster programs within the Department of Housing and Urban Development, Department of Education, Small Business Administration, Department of Labor, Department of Energy--just to name a few. So it is very hard for folks whose lives and families have been devastated as a result of a natural disaster to know where it is they need to go to get the relief they need and deserve. 
   Sometimes, the assistance just doesn't come quickly enough. One example is Bobby Carraway, who owned a restaurant in Kinston NC, near the Neuse River. The river flooded, and his restaurant sat under more than 3 feet of water for many days. He lost his entire business. But with the help of his landlord, who let up on the rent, and his food suppliers, who told him he could pay when he could, neighbors who helped him clean up his business, and a large chunk of his own personal savings, he was able to reopen his restaurant. 
   Today, one year after Hurricane Floyd threatened to take his livelihood, Bobby is still waiting for the Small Business Administration to approve his loan. He should not have to wait so long, and residents such as Edna should not have to navigate through these confusing Federal and State programs, especially when they are dealing with devastation to family and emotional trauma caused by natural disasters such as Hurricane Floyd. 
   The biggest lesson we have learned from this storm is that the Federal, State, and local responses to disasters have to be better coordinated and must be more efficient. 
   Senator STEVENS from Alaska and I cochair the Natural Hazards Disaster Caucus. Seventeen Senators have joined us. Our goal is to provide concrete steps that Federal, State, and local programs can work together to protect our residents, provide a more efficient response, and mitigate the cost and destruction of future disasters. 
   The Government can't make people whole again after a disaster, but we can, and should, be prepared to do all we can to help people get back on their feet. 
   We have made great strides in our recovery in North Carolina, but we still have a long way to go. Most Federal officials agree it will be another 2 years before eastern North Carolina has completely recovered. Today, hundreds of people will mark the anniversary of Hurricane Floyd in their FEMA trailers, where they live. We are facing a rental housing shortfall of about 4,000 units, and thousands of victims are facing many years of debt as a result of this disaster. 
   I am grateful to the Senate for including $50 million for North Carolina for the USDA's Community Facilities Grant Program in the Agriculture appropriations bill. This money will make a real difference in a town such as Farmville, which needs help rebuilding its fire station. 
   I also want to take this opportunity to thank FEMA Director James Lee Witt and his entire agency for their dedication to helping those who simply could not help themselves. 
   Governor Jim Hunt has worked tirelessly to help the residents of our State. Most importantly, I want to take this opportunity to thank the people of North Carolina--the thousands of volunteers who, over the course of the last year, have responded heroically to the damage done and the devastation done to their neighbors and friends. 
   It has been a long year, and we still have a lot of work left to do. Hurricane Floyd's victims were innocent people, regular working people who have done nothing wrong but had everything taken from them as a result of this natural disaster. They deserve our continued support and dedication as they attempt to rebuild their homes and their lives. 
   Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, I rise today to say how pleased I am that the President recently signed into law H.R. 1749, legislation that designates Wilson Creek in North Carolina as a wild and scenic river. This legislation passed the House of Representatives without opposition, and I was proud to support it here in the Senate and to see it pass just prior to the August recess. 
   The designation of Wilson Creek as a wild and scenic river is critically important to the local community. It will protect Wilson Creek for use by those who seek a relaxing hike in the woods or an exciting rafting experience. The scenic and recreational areas along Wilson Creek are also some of the most beautiful and ecologically valuable countryside in all of North Carolina. In a time when all of us have so much going on in our lives, Wilson Creek will provide us with a place to relax and enjoy a bit of the natural world. 
   Wilson Creek is truly a national treasure. It possesses remarkable scenic and recreational value and is home to a wide variety of plant and animal species. It is designated as an Outstanding Resource Water, indicating its exceptional recreational and ecological significance and high level of water quality. It winds its way through rare geologic rock formations that are also quite beautiful. The pools and rapids along Wilson Creek provide opportunities for canoe and kayak enthusiasts to test their skills or take a relaxing paddle. For years, visitors have camped, hiked, fished and played along Wilson Creek, and this designation will ensure that they will continue to enjoy all that the area has to offer for years to come. 
   I would also like to say a few words about the history of this legislation and the impressive effort that has led us to this important point. It is not enough to say that this measure was a bipartisan effort. This law is the result of a cooperative effort spearheaded by the Caldwell County Commissioners, in which every interested party had a voice. Working with the Forest Service, the Avery County Commissioners, the Caldwell County Chamber of Commerce, the Caldwell County Economic Development Commission, local landowners and the local community, the Commissioners helped develop this important plan to protect permanently Wilson Creek. That this legislation has had such strong local support is a testament to the hard work put forward by all of these groups and individuals. The collaborative effort to craft and pass this legislation will serve as a model for other communities that may have similar projects. They are to be commended for their efforts. I would also like to thank other local officials, citizens, the Forest Service, and everyone else who dedicated so much time, effort, and heart to get us to this point. 
   Many portions along Wilson Creek exist much as they did more than 100 years ago, and I believe we must do all we can to preserve them. We have a rare opportunity to protect a critically important waterway for future generations, and I am so pleased to see it become law.

   Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, I rise today to join with my colleagues in mourning the loss of Senator PAUL COVERDELL of Georgia. 
   He was a man that I respected and admired. All of us here in the Senate feel his absence acutely. Paul COVERDELL was a fixture in the Senate. I cannot recall how often I have sat at my desk and, looking up at C-SPAN, saw him there leading his party on one difficult issue after another. He did so honorably, tenaciously, and modestly. And, of course, he did so effectively. 
   I feel a real void in the Senate Chamber without his presence and feel a sense of surprise when I look up and see someone other than Senator COVERDELL at the Republican floor manager's desk.

   Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, I rise today to express my support for the Disaster Mitigation and Cost Reduction Act, and more importantly--the Federal Emergency Management Agency. 
   When I was elected to the Senate more than a year ago, I didn't think I would be faced with such an enormous challenge my first year in office--helping my state rebuild from the one of the worst hurricanes in our history. On September 16, Hurricane Floyd pounded eastern North Carolina. Sixty-six counties, more than 70 percent of the state--were declared federal disaster areas. Fifty-seven people were killed, and more than 60,000 homes were affected. 
   I've come to the floor many times and praised the courage and the strength of eastern North Carolinians. Through this disaster, I have met some of the most spirited and strong people. And I have also met some of the most knowledgeable and caring federal workers--the men and women of the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Whether it was Director James Lee Witt, who visited my office many times to keep me up-to-date on the federal response, or any of the field representatives who explained the programs available to the victims, FEMA helped North Carolina begin the long recovery process. And today, ten months after the storm hit, FEMA is still helping us coordinate the federal and state recovery efforts. It's been said before--and I now know first-hand--that Director Witt turned FEMA from a disaster of an agency into a disaster response team. 
   The measure we pass today will help make simple changes to ensure this agency continues to offer first-rate response. Most importantly, the bill before us would increase the Hazard Mitigation Grant Program cap from 15 percent to 20 percent. We can't stop a hurricane, tornado or earthquake, but we can take concrete steps to mitigate damage. Increasing the amount States are allowed to spend on mitigation will give those governments the necessary resources to move those people out of harm's way. That means less future damage and less costly disasters. 
   H.R. 707 also authorizes Project Impact. New Hanover County, in my state, was one of the first seven pilot Project Impact communities. Project Impact is FEMA's predisaster mitigation program that works directly with communities across the country to help them become more disaster-resistant. In New Hanover County, residents are determined to build better, stronger and smarter in order to prevent damage from the inevitable late-summer hurricanes. The University of North Carolina at Wilmington is also involved in the effort to mitigate disasters. That's the great thing about the Project Impact communities--they are using all available agencies and organizations to ensure safe and smart development. We should officially recognize these communities efforts and encourage the same work in other disaster prone areas. 
    Finally, in my State we know how the Federal government's disaster response programs work--and sometimes don't work--together. This bill takes steps to streamline the programs and to better coordinate between different agencies. Portions of this bill would make life a bit simpler for our outstanding emergency management agency in North Carolina. Whether it's streamlining management costs or making infrastructure repairs simpler, this bill makes much-needed improvements in the system. 
   Mr. President, there is no area of the country untouched by natural disasters. Whether it's my state battered by hurricanes; California plagued by earthquakes; the Midwest hit by floods; or the states in ``tornado alley;'' we all know the sudden devastation Mother Nature can bring. And we all know we can count on FEMA at a time when the states we represent are most vulnerable, when our people hurt the most. Now its time for Congress to support this bill and to ensure FEMA can continue the first-rate response we so depend on.

   Mr. EDWARDS. I thank you for including my amendment to provide $1,800,000 in emergency funds for the United States Geological Survey to repair and replace stream monitoring equipment damaged by natural disasters. As you know, your Committee recommended a significant increase in the USGS's Real Time Hazards Initiative, including $3,100,000 for new or upgraded stream gauging stations. 
   1999 was a devastating year for North Carolina. Hurricanes Floyd, Dennis and Irene did extensive damage across eastern North Carolina. And early indications are that this hurricane season will be just as active for North Carolina as last year. North Carolina's stream gauges and monitoring equipment are in desperate need of upgrade and enhancement. I respectfully request that the Committee recommend that the United States Geological Survey give special consideration to North Carolina's needs and address the need for upgrades and enhancements through this appropriation.

   Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, I will respond to the Senator from New Hampshire. He argues there is a new provision in the Republican plan that provides for liability. That provision is a sham. There are three points I want to make in response. 
   First is the argument that we are creating an open season on employers. It is simply false. Not true. A letter from the American Medical Association of June 23 states clearly:  
   The insurance industry--  
   And the Republican plan in this case--  
   is flat wrong, and to imply otherwise is frankly deceptive. The fact is, the bipartisan House-passed bill would actually protect employers.  
   Under our bill, an employer cannot be held responsible under specific language unless they actively intervene in the decision of the insurance carrier, which never occurs. 
    There is to reason  for it to occur. It in fact never occurs. It is a false argument that employers can be held liable under our proposal. They cannot. 
   Second, the argument that they are providing for liability is simply not true. Under their plan, an insurance company can never be held responsible for their initial decision to deny coverage. So if somebody goes to their doctor with an emergency situation--they need care--and the insurance company says no, and, as a result, they suffer a lifelong injury, a debilitating injury, or death, the insurance company cannot be held accountable. They can only be held accountable, can only be held responsible, if they have exhausted the internal review process and the insurance company acted in bad faith or if they failed to follow the decision from the external review board. 
   The bottom line is, it creates an incentive for the insurance company to deny coverage in the first instance because under no circumstances can they be held responsible, and under no circumstances can they be held accountable. For those reasons, this provision for HMO insurance carrier liability is not real; it is a sham. 
   Our proposal provides real and meaningful accountability.

   Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, let me begin by thanking Senators STEVENS, LOTT, MCCONNELL, LEAHY, and BYRD for accepting this amendment, No. 3582. Throughout the process of dealing with Hurricane Floyd and its impact on my State they have been unstinting in their help and deserve the thanks and deep appreciation of the people of North Carolina. I've also had the honor of working with Senators TORRICELLI and ROBB on this amendment. They have fought hard for their States. 
   This amendment would provide $125 million in funding to the Economic Development Administration this year. It would also provide $125 million in funding this year for USDA's Community Facilities program. 
   Mr. President, this money is desperately needed. Although 9 months have passed since Hurricane Floyd struck North Carolina, the people of eastern Carolina are still struggling to rebuild. Thousands still live in FEMA trailers. Hundreds of businesses still haven't reopened. Several cities are still operating under sewage and water moratoria. 
   This amendment will mean the difference between businesses reopening and businesses closing, people working and people not working, cities thriving and cities withering. 
   I believe this amendment will make a real difference, and will put us on the road to recovery. Let me submit a list of possible $100 million in EDA projects that has been prepared by the State. This list is by no means exhaustive, but it illustrates the extent of the need and how much good this money can be used for. 
   I am enormously pleased that this amendment has been accepted. We have a lot more work to do in order to enact it into law. I hope this provision will be incorporated into the final supplemental appropriations package that is being negotiated as part of the Military Construction appropriations conference. The innocent victims of Hurricane Floyd deserve no less.

   Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, I thank all of my colleagues who are involved in this conference and thank them for their hard work and certainly defer to all of them about the specifics of what has occurred in the conference and the work they have done there. 
   There are some specific issues about which I am concerned. First, it is important for the American people to understand that the Patients' Bill of Rights means nothing unless those rights are enforceable. Under any of these bills that are being considered, there are only two enforcement mechanisms. Without those mechanisms working, without them being effective, the rights don't exist because the insurance companies can do anything they want and can never be held responsible for what they do. 
   There are two enforcement mechanisms. First, if we have a real and meaningful independent appeals process, that is an enforcement mechanism. Second, we do for health insurance companies the same thing we do for every single American listening to this debate--when they hurt somebody, we hold them responsible. 
   There has been a lot of argument about lawyers, lawsuits, and HMOs. Why in the world are HMOs and health insurance companies entitled to be treated any differently than the rest of  us? When we walk out the door and with our automobile or some other way cause injury or death to somebody, we are responsible for that. Everybody listening to this debate can be held responsible. Why is the health insurance company entitled to be treated differently? Are they a special cut above the rest of us? 
   We need real and meaningful enforcement mechanisms. The appeals provision that came out of the Senate was not truly independent because the insurance company had control over the people who made the appeals decision. Something has to be done about that; Otherwise, there is no independent appeal. That issue, as I understand it, has not been resolved. If it is not resolved, the appeals process means nothing. It is not independent. 
   The other issue I want to talk about is holding HMOs accountable for what they do or do not do, treating them as every other American citizen, every other American business. It is important to not pay too much attention to the rhetoric. There is lots of rhetoric in this debate. We are creating a cause of action, a right to sue, and we just want to exempt employers from that. 
   Unfortunately, the use of language makes a huge difference in whether the patient really has a right or not. Let me give an example. This is language that was proposed recently in the conference from the Republicans about creating a cause of action:  
   A new Federal statutory cause of action would be created in ERISA to allow for lawsuits for failure to comply with the decision of the independent medical reviewer.  
   In other words, no matter what the insurance company does, as long as they do what the independent reviewer says they have to do, they can never be held responsible. 
   Here is the problem with that: A patient goes to the hospital. They need emergency medical care. They call the HMO. The HMO says we will not cover it; we will not pay for it. The patient dies as a result or is seriously injured for the rest of their life. Three days later, after an appeal is filed, some independent reviewer says, of course this was covered by the policy. So the insurer says: Now I will comply; I will do what the independent reviewer says. 
   As long as they do that, under this provision, they cannot be held responsible. 
   The problem is they did the damage when they made the initial decision. If they make an absolutely egregious decision, for whatever reason, no matter how bad their conduct, we are not going to cover this care. 
   Then, if 4 or 5 days later they are reversed by an independent review, they cannot be held responsible for that original decision no matter what the damage is, no matter how irreversible it is. 
   It also creates a natural incentive to deny coverage, because, No. 1, if they deny coverage, the chances are the patient won't appeal; No. 2, if they deny coverage and they are reversed 4 days later, there are no consequences. There is absolutely no reason, no financial reason whatsoever, for the insurance company to do anything other than, when in doubt, deny coverage because we can never be held responsible for that decision. 
   Let me give a couple of very specific examples. A patient with adult onset diabetes has been on insulin, injectable insulin, his entire life. The insurance company--this is a real example, real-life example----

   Mr. EDWARDS. The insurance company says: You can take oral medication; you don't need insulin. He appeals. During the time the appeal is being considered, 3, 5, 7 days, he has a stroke and goes blind. 
   Then the independent review says: Of course, he was entitled to keep his insulin. So the insurance company says: All right, we will provide insulin now. 
   Now we have a 55-year-old man who has had a stroke; he is blind; he cannot work anymore; he cannot care for his family. Where does he go? Who is going to help his family? The insurance company cannot be held responsible for what they did, not under this proposal. This language matters. It is critically important, what the language says. 
   A young boy, Ethan Bedrick, with cerebral palsy, 5 years old, all his doctors say he needs to have physical therapy, every one of them. The insurance company says he doesn't need it. They appeal. The independent reviewer happens to be somebody who has absolutely no experience with children with cerebral palsy. This is a real-life example. So he says: The insurance company is right; we are not going to give this 5-year old child with cerebral palsy physical therapy. 
   Where does he go? The independent reviewer, who knows nothing about children with cerebral palsy, has denied coverage. The insurance company has denied coverage, coverage for which his parents have been paying for 20 years. So where does he go? For the rest of his life he has cerebral palsy. He is contracted, bound up, can't get the daily physical therapy he needs, and he has nowhere to go. There is absolutely no remedy for Ethan Bedrick. 
   I say to my colleagues in the Senate, what happens to this little 5-year-old boy when this happens? He cannot go to court, not under this proposal. He cannot go anywhere. The insurance company has cut him off, and he has been cut off from the care he needs.

   Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, I say to my colleague who just argued about employers, that is another example it is so critical we look specifically to the language and not the rhetoric. 
   Our bill at page 245 specifically exempts employers from any liability unless they intervene in the process of making decisions about claims. Period. If all they do is buy health insurance, which is what 99 percent of certainly small employers do, they cannot be held responsible. On the other hand, if they decide they are going to engage in the business of deciding what claims are going to be denied, like General Motors or a big company that runs its own plan, then they ought to be held responsible. The majority of employers cannot be held responsible at all unless they intervene. 
   Second, Ethan Bedrick, a 5-year-old boy, is a real-life example. His claim was denied by the independent reviewer. If the language we have been talking about becomes law, we will not have a real Patients' Bill of Rights, and Ethan has nowhere to go. He cannot go to court. He does not have any other appeal. The reality is people make mistakes. A 5-year-old boy who has a lifetime of needed care needs a place to go.

   Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, Big Browser is watching you. Almost every time, you or I or an American consumer surfs the Internet, someone is tracking our movements. And someone is compiling a databank of information about our preferences and could even be profiling us. 
   Maybe they're doing it to make our experience better. Most of the time, they probably are. But too often we are being profiled for profit, and at the expense of privacy. 
   I am proud to co-sponsor Senator HOLLINGS' legislation, the Consumer Privacy Protection Act, that would help consumers gain control of their most personal information. I believe that the measure we introduce today is a step in the right direction. It strikes the right balance. Privacy is protected, while critical elements of the information revolution are preserved. Consumer confidence in the Internet is bolstered, while businesses will not be overburdened by the requirements. 
   We can enjoy the convenience of online shopping and allow e-commerce to thrive without putting profits over privacy. Consumers, not dot.com companies, should control the use of confidential information about buying habits, credit card records and other personal information. 
   Mr. President, the time to act is now. If not, we may wake up one day to find our privacy so thoroughly eroded that recovering it will be almost impossible. 
   No one denies that the rapid development of modern technology has been beneficial. New and improved technologies have enabled us to obtain information more quickly and easily than ever before. Students can participate in classes that are being taught in other states, or even in other countries. Almost no product or piece of information is beyond the reach of Americans anymore. A farmer in Sampson County, North Carolina can go on the Internet and compare prices for anything he needs to run his business. Or he can look up critical weather information on the Internet. Or he can just order a hard-to-get book. Meanwhile, companies have streamlined their processes for providing goods and services. 
   But these remarkable developments can have a startling downside. They have made it easier to track personal information such as medical and financial records and buying habits. They have made it profitable to do so. And in turn, our ability to keep our personal information private is being eaten away.  
   The impact of this erosion ranges from the merely annoying--having your mailbox flooded with junkmail--to the actually frightening--having your identity stolen or being turned down for a loan because your bank got copies of your medical records. There are thousands of ways that the loss of our privacy can impact us. Many of them are intangible--just the discomfort of knowing that complete strangers can find out everything about you: where you shop, what books you buy, whether you have allergies, and what your credit rating is. These strangers may not do anything bad with the information, but they know all about you. I think privacy is a value per se. Our founding fathers recognized it, and so too do most Americans. 
   ``Liberty in the constitutional sense,'' wrote Justice William O. Douglas, ``must mean more than freedom from unlawful governmental restraint; it must include privacy as well, if it is to be a repository of freedom. The right to be let alone is indeed the beginning of all freedom.'' 
   Recent surveys indicate that the American public is increasingly uneasy about the degradation of their privacy. In a recent Business Week poll, 92 percent of Internet users expressed discomfort about Web sites sharing personal information with other sites. Meanwhile, an FTC report issued yesterday indicated that only 42 percent of the most popular Internet sites comply with the four key fair information practices--notice about what data is collected, consumer choice about whether the data will be shared with third-parties, consumer access to the data, and security regarding the transmission of data. 
   We must be vigilant that our privacy does not become a commodity to be bought and sold. 
   I would also like to point out one area of privacy protection that I have been deeply interested in. Last November, I introduced the Telephone Call Privacy Act. My bill would prevent telecommunications companies from using an individual's personal phone call records without their consent. Most Americans would be stunned to learn that the law does not protect them from having their phone records sold to third parties. Imagine getting a call one night--during dinner--and having a telemarketer try to sell you membership in a travel club because your phone calling patterns show frequent calls overseas. My legislation would prevent this from occurring without the individuals's permission. 
   This measure we introduce today also contains a provision relating to telephone privacy. It differs in at least one key respect from the legislation I previously introduced, but my hope is that as we discuss this issue over time, the differences will be resolved. 
   Mr. President, let me conclude by thanking Senators HOLLINGS and LEAHY for their leadership on this vital issue. Senator HOLLINGS has crafted the comprehensive and thoughtful proposal that we introduce today. Senator LEAHY has led a coalition of Senators interested in this issue. I look forward to working with them and my other colleagues in passing this measure.

   Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, we are about to pass the $8.6 billion military construction appropriations bill. While I am pleased that this bill contains a significant amount of funding for projects in North Carolina, I continue to be concerned that despite repeated assurances, emergency relief for victims of Hurricane Floyd is still in a holding pattern. 
   Before we began the appropriations process, we were assured that much-needed emergency money for Hurricane Floyd victims would be attached to the first--and fastest--moving appropriation bill. Obviously, Hurricane Floyd relief is not in this bill, and now, thousands of hurricane victims are still waiting on the Federal Government to do what's right. 
   These people are hurting like they have never hurt before. And I guarantee you that the Hurricane Floyd victims spread across the 13 affected states don't care about the politics that go along with the appropriations process. The victims of Hurricane Floyd did nothing wrong. They paid their taxes for years, voted in the elections and believed us when we told them that this is a government for the people. The victims aren't looking for a handout. Most of these people have never asked for the government's help, and now that they need it desperately, they are caught in a frustrating waiting game. 
   I sincerely hope that we can work through the Agriculture appropriations request as quickly and fairly as we did with the military construction appropriations bill.

   Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, I rise today to oppose the conference report on the Trade and Development Act of 2000, the so-called African-Caribbean trade bill. 
   When we debated this bill last October, I expressed my concerns about it, and what has happened is the fruition of what I was concerned about at that time. A bill that was bad when it left the Senate last October has become worse. This bill creates enormous risks for American textile businesses and American textile workers, with very little in the way of offsetting benefits. 
   Let me speak for a couple of minutes about what I think is wrong with this bill and what kind of risk I think it creates for American workers. When we negotiate trade agreements, in my judgment, there are certain fundamental principles that should always be adhered to: First, they must be negotiated and multilateral; that is, both sides give up something; second, that they create a fair and enforceable system so the trade agreements don't become an empty shell but in fact there is a real and meaningful mechanism for enforcing the trade agreements; third, they must have adequate labor and environmental protections; and, fourth, they must have real, tangible, and provable benefits for U.S. businesses and U.S. workers. 
   These bills do not meet those basic principles that ought to be complied with on every single trade agreement. 
   Senator FEINGOLD spoke very eloquently about the lack of adequate labor and environmental protections in these bills. 
   There are two other principles that have been violated in these bills. First is the requirement that they be multilateral and negotiated, the simple proposition being that if the American people and we as a country are going to lower our barriers, we ought to get something in return. That ``something'' is that the other countries that are subject to these trade agreements lower their barriers. That simply has not happened here. 
   What is happening is we are lowering our trade barriers while these other Caribbean and African nations are keeping their trade barriers completely in place. Their tariffs remain just as they were. There is no set of circumstances under which that kind of arrangement is equitable for American business or equitable for American workers. 
   Second, there has to be a real and meaningful mechanism for enforcing these provisions. One of the things that happened to this bill when it left the Senate is there was a complex set of enforcement mechanisms and provisions put in place. When the bill left the Senate, we had what was called yarn and fabric forward provisions, which basically said, as a matter of equity, we would allow the trade barriers to be lowered for those African and Caribbean nations that used yarn and fabric from the United States so that our workers and our businesses benefited. 
   Well, when the bill got to conference with the House bill, those provisions were changed. Now there are many African nations that are not required to use American yarn or American fabric. Secondly, they are allowed to use regional yarn and fabric; that is, yarn and fabric from that area. 
   So those are two significant changes in the bill since it left the floor of the Senate which have real and meaningful 
   impact on American business and American workers. 
   Probably the more dangerous situation, though, is that created by the potential for transshipment. We talked about this on the floor of the Senate when this bill was debated the first time, and my colleagues are aware of this problem. 
   Transshipment, basically, is a situation where a country, such as China, which I think has the greatest potential for taking advantage of transshipment, ships their fabric and their goods through Africa only for the purpose of having a button sewn on or some other minor change in the product, and then the product is shipped to the United States. 
   The antitransshipment provisions of this bill are simply not adequate for a variety of reasons. One of the two most important is that the enforcement mechanism relies upon African countries for enforcement. The reality is--and all of us know it--that these African nations are not going to be able to enforce the provisions about transshipment. And we are going to have--at least there is real potential for--a massive transshipment by China and Chinese textile businesses through Africa to the United States. Transshipment has a real and devastating effect on American workers and American businesses, and we have seen some of those effects over the last 8 to 10 years. 
   I have some specific examples of this. In North Carolina, my home State, during 1999, these were the jobs that were lost as a result of cheap textile goods coming into the United States: 
   At Pluma, Inc., a plant located in Eden, NC, a small community, 500 jobs were lost when the plant was closed. Jasper closed a plant in Whiteville, NC, in September and 191 jobs were lost. Whiteville Apparel in Whiteville, NC, closed a plant in August and 396 jobs were lost. 
   Stonecutter Mills in Rutherford and Polk in western North Carolina closed a plant in June--800 jobs lost. Dyersburg in Hamilton, NC, closed a plant in May--422 jobs lost. Levi Straus closed a plant in Murphy--382 jobs lost. 
   Remember that we are only talking about 1999 at this point. 
   Burlington Industries, in January, closed plants in Cramerton, Forest City, Mooresville, Raeford, Oxford, and Statesville--2,600 jobs lost as a result; all of those occurring in 1999. 
   In 1999 alone, the South lost 55,000 textile and apparel jobs. 
   This is not an abstract position for the families and employees whose lives  are devastated as a result of these cheap goods coming into the United States. 
   A perfect example is Margie Brown. You heard me talk about Whiteville, NC, which was one of the areas in eastern North Carolina hardest hit by this flow of cheap goods into the United States. Margie Brown is 47 years old. She had a good job working at Jasper Textiles in Whiteville, NC. She made just under $200 a week. She depended on it. Her family depended on the income from that job. It is what she was trained to do; It is what she knew how to do; and she felt good about what she did. 
   As a result of that plant being closed down, the reality exists all over North Carolina. In many cases there is no work for these folks; they have no comparable employment. There is nothing they can do with the education and the job training they have. 
   So she had nowhere to go. Today, instead of having a job she is proud of, being able to support her family, feeling good about going to work every day and doing the things that made her productive as an American citizen, she is on unemployment and she gets $51 a week. 
   My point is that these are real people. These are real families, and the impact on them is devastating. We can't turn our heads on this. This is not hypothetical. This is not some theoretical thing we are talking about. It is all well and good for us to talk abstractly on the floor of the Senate about trade being good, about, in this case, this having some diffuse benefit to our country as a whole, but there are real people whose lives are being devastated by these trade agreements, real people who have nowhere to go to work tomorrow, who have no way of taking care of their families and who have lost all semblance of self-esteem. 
   These people, who oftentimes worked in textile mills for 20, 30, or 40 years--I do have to say at this point my dad worked in a cotton mill basically his whole life. During the summers, in high school and college, and then in law school, I saw firsthand the people who spent their whole lives in these textile mills and these cotton mills. They do not know anything else. 
   We can talk about the technological world we now live in and how these people have to make a transition because the world is changing. The reality is, many of them are 50 or 60 years old and have spent their whole life working in the mill. They have nowhere to go. They have no idea what to do about their families. They are put on the street after working every day for the last 30 or 40 years. What do they say to their kids? What do they say to their spouses about what they are going to do? 
   My point is that these trade agreements have a real impact on real people's lives, and we all have to recognize it. In fact, this particular agreement is going to do nothing but accelerate the problem. The Margie Browns I just described will be all over North Carolina and the southern United States. 
   The reason is very simple: The average apparel wage in the United States is $8 an hour. 
   Of some of the countries that are covered by this agreement: In Mexico the average wage is 85 cents an hour; the Dominican Republic, 69 cents an hour; El Salvador, 59 cents an hour; Guatemala, 65 cents an hour; and, Honduras, 43 cents an hour. 
   You don't have to be a mathematical wizard to figure out that there is no way for American workers under these circumstances to compete, and there is no way they are going to keep their jobs. 
   What will happen is China is going to ship goods through Africa. In all likelihood, there will be massive transshipping with no way to stop it, no way to detect it, and no way to enforce the antitransshipment provisions of this bill. As a result, people all over North Carolina and the United States are going to lose their jobs. 
   We are playing with fire. I said this when we debated the bill last fall. I say it again. The only thing that has changed is the fire has gotten hotter. It has gotten more dangerous. 
   There are more American workers whose jobs are going to be lost, and this conference report it does not meet the fundamental principles of equity, the principles that ought to apply to every trade agreement, the principles that are needed to protect our businesses and our textile workers in the United States. 
   They are perfectly willing to compete. They just want the chance to compete on a level playing field. The other countries aren't lowering their barriers. We are. We know there are going to be goods transshipped through Africa from China and other places. And there is no way to prepare for that. The net result is this is not an abstract thing. Real people, real families, lives and jobs are about to be changed.

   Mr. EDWARDS. I thank the Chair. 
   Mr. President, I want to speak to three subjects today: first, to the subject of education in general; second, to some of the things we have done in North Carolina in the area of education of which we are very proud, particularly in our public schools; and, third, to talk specifically about the Lieberman-Bayh amendment. 
   First, the single test we should apply in determining what to do with our public school system is what is in the best interest of the kids--not what is in the best interest of either political party, not what is in the best interest for either candidate for the President of the United States, but what is in the best interest in improving the lives and education of our young people. 
   Anywhere one goes in North Carolina, if one were to ask folks what is the most important thing we do as a Government, they would tell you over and over: Educate our young people. If one were then to tell them the reality, which is that we spend less than 1 percent of the Federal budget on over 50 million school children in the United States, they would be absolutely flabbergasted. The single issue that the American people believe is the most important thing their Government does takes less than 1 percent of the Federal budget. They believe more needs to be done. 
   I believe strongly that our school systems should be run at the local level, that people at the State and local level know much better than people in Washington how our school systems should be run. That does not mean, however, there are not things we can do as the Federal Government to partner with State and local government officials in educating young people. That is what we need to be doing. 
   There is nothing in our Constitution that says we cannot devote more than 1 percent of the Federal budget to public education. We have to be willing to devote the resources to make education the priority it is for the American people, to put the resources into it, to put the effort into it, and to help State and local officials do the job they so desperately want to do. 
   I will say a word about some of the things we have done in North Carolina. We believe North Carolina is, in fact, the education State. For example, we started a program in early childhood development called Smart Start. The basic idea of Smart Start, which now exists in every county in North Carolina, was to get all kids into an early childhood development program and to get them on the right track so they later could be kept on the right track. Smart Start got them at a time when it had the most influence over them, which is before they reach the age of 6 or 7 and begin elementary school. 
   Smart Start has worked. It has had a dramatic effect in our State of North Carolina. Smart Start, most importantly, is an example of what happens when we are willing to think outside the box. We have to be willing to constantly examine whether what we are doing is working, whether there are new, innovative, more creative ways to educate our young people. Again, the test ought to always be the same: What is in the best interest of the kids? What is going to be most effective in giving our kids the best education we can possibly give them? 
   Smart Start is a perfect example of that. It is new. It was innovative when it came into play. It has worked. We have to be willing to continue to think about programs such as Smart Start. 
   The way we dealt with failing schools in North Carolina is another example. We went across the State and identified those schools that were failing; that is, they were not doing the job that needed to be done. Talk about accountability, this is accountability in its purest form. If a school was failing, we essentially replaced the administration of that school. In other words, we put people in charge of running the school for the purpose of turning it around. 
   The results have been absolutely phenomenal. Almost without 
   exception, those schools have been turned around, the kids' grades have improved, and their performance has improved. Again, this is another example of being willing to think outside the box, to think creatively and innovatively. 
   Recently, I was in North Carolina meeting with some folks who were working on the cutting edge of public education. They showed an example of a computer program that can be used by kids in the early grades of elementary school. 
   They can take kids, particularly disadvantaged kids, and put them in front of a computer in an environment where they feel safe, where they do not have to perform in front of the other children so they do not feel as if they are a failure from the very beginning. It gets them engaged. The single most important thing with young kids is to get them engaged, to make them believe they have some control over their own destiny; that they can, in fact, compete; that they can effectively compete against all the kids; and, more important, it gives them self-esteem. It makes them feel as if they can actually do something about their lives. 
   This computer program had a phenomenal effect on the performance of disadvantaged kids. Once again, the test remains the same: What is in the best interest of the children? Are we willing to constantly challenge our approaches, how they can be better molded to fit the needs of the children? The computer program I just described does that; Smart Start does that; that is  what our mechanism for dealing with disadvantaged and failing schools did in North Carolina. 
   That brings me to the Lieberman amendment, which is just another example on the national level of being willing to address issues creatively, innovatively, and to think outside the box, to think about what is in the best interest of the kids and what is the most effective way of addressing the needs of kids. 
   I will freely admit there are some provisions in the Lieberman amendment which caused me some concern when I first saw them, but it does many positive, creative things. First and foremost for me is the willingness to invest in title I, to provide more resources and more funding and to target those funds to the kids who most need the help. 
   If my colleagues do what I have done over the course of the last 2 1/2 , 3 years and go to schools across my State of North Carolina, the one thing that becomes immediately apparent is our kids do not compete on a level playing field. That was the original idea behind title I: trying to create a level playing field so no matter where a kid went to school, no matter where they were enrolled in school, whether it was in the country in rural North Carolina or Charlotte, Raleigh, or Greensboro, they had an equal opportunity to achieve and equal opportunity to learn. 
   I have to give tremendous credit to Senator LIEBERMAN, Senator BAYH, and all the moderate Democrats who worked so hard on this amendment. What they have done is identified the kids who most need the help--the place where the achievement gap exists--and gone about thinking creatively how we can make these kids achieve, how we can give them the best possible chance to be able to perform because we have to be willing to do something. 
   We have consistently underfunded title I in the past. There has been a lot of rhetoric about our willingness and interest in helping disadvantaged kids. Now we get a chance to step up to the plate. That is exactly what Senator LIEBERMAN and Senator BAYH have done. They have said: We are willing to put our money where our mouth is. We are willing to put the resources in place that need to be there to help these kids, these disadvantaged kids, to give them a chance to compete. 
   That is all they ask for. That is what the computer program is about. That is what reducing class size is about. We have to give these children, who have not been achieving, who have not been responding to the traditional ways of educating young people, a chance to compete. We have to be willing to think outside the box. We have to be willing to say to ourselves that maybe we have been wrong in the past, maybe there are new and better ways to do this. 
   That is exactly what the Lieberman amendment is aimed at doing. That is the reason the Lieberman amendment is supported by the moderate Democrats. The Lieberman amendment is just another in a long line of examples--except in this case it is at the national level--of new and creative ways of addressing the needs of our young people. 
   As we go forward with this debate, and as we go forward with addressing the needs in educating our young people, we have to be willing to do what has been done in my home State of North Carolina, what has worked so well--programs such as Smart Start, programs dealing with failing schools, these computer programs that have been so effective, and now, in this case, on a national level, the Lieberman amendment. 
   We have to be willing to question ourselves. We have to be willing to put the money in place that is needed to educate our young people, which is more than 1 percent of the national budget, and that, ultimately, we are committed to making the first decade of this century the education decade, and that we are committed to making our schools the envy of the world. We have the best economy, the best roads, the best technology in the world; it is high time we be able to say to the world, our schools are the envy of the world. 
   Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.

   Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, 7 months after Hurricane Floyd hit North Carolina and other States along the east coast, we still have thousands of people who are living in trailers and thousands more who have no place to live. We have towns such as Princeville and Tarboro that have literally been wiped out. Innocent, law-abiding, tax-paying people desperately need our help. This amendment provides $250 million in relief for the people of North Carolina and all of the victims of Hurricane Floyd. 
   This photograph, taken the day before yesterday, shows that we are still suffering and are still struggling. I thank my colleagues very much for their support of this amendment, and I yield to the Senator from New Jersey.

   Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, first I would like to speak on the Graham amendment. The single most important thing we do as a country is educate our children. What we should be doing in this debate is talking about making this decade the education decade. We have great roads, great technology, great airports, a great economy in this country. We should be working toward making our schools the envy of the world. Instead, we have children who go to the local mall and go to beautiful, shiny buildings and stores and then the next morning go to schools that are falling down, with roofs leaking, with floors that are covered over with patchwork carpet. We have to do better. 
   We need to send a clear and unmistakable signal to the American people that we are committed and dedicated to doing what is necessary to improve our public schools. I have filed a sense-of-the-Senate amendment that provides for two things: First, that the level of education spending will be maintained at the current level, taking inflation into account over the next 10 years. Second, that we commit a minimum of 10 percent of the non-Social Security surplus to spending on education. 
   It is a very simple resolution. It is intended to signal our commitment to do what is necessary to support our public schools. I also, though, want to speak about the Graham amendment which does some very important things that need to be done in our public schools. There are basically five components to the Graham amendment. 
   No. 1, it invests the resources that are so desperately needed in our education system; resources that can be used to rebuild crumbling schools; resources that can be used to modernize schools where the roof is leaking, where kids have to go outside to get to the restroom, where kids are going to school in mobile classrooms. Those resources are desperately needed. We need to show our commitment, and the Graham amendment does that. 
   No. 2, it provides for local control. Those of us supporting this amendment believe very strongly that the school system should not be run from Washington, DC; that, instead, our schools should be run at the local level. It is local folks who know what is needed in the local schools. That is where the control should be. That is what the Graham amendment provides. That is what the American people believe in and support. 
   No. 3, accountability. Senator GRAHAM talked about accountability. We cannot simply continue throwing money at our education system. We need to provide those systems with the resources they need for all the things we have talked about: crumbling schools, technology, afterschool programs, hiring more teachers, and reducing class size so the teachers can do their jobs. 
   But we need to hold these schools accountable. We need to make sure they are performing; that schools that are not doing well are improving; that kids who are going to schools that are not performing well will be getting the kind of education they need and deserve. Accountability is absolutely crucial to making our public education system work. The Graham amendment provides for accountability. It is a critical component of what needs to be done in our education system in this country. 
   No. 4, this amendment targets those kids who are most in need, 
   the kids in this country who are having the most problems in the poorest areas, in the rural areas, particularly in places such as rural North Carolina, rural eastern and western North Carolina--chronically economically disadvantaged areas where the kids are not on a level playing field. They do not have a chance. They do not have self-esteem. They don't feel as if they can compete with kids who go to school in richer, urban areas. 
   We need to give these children a chance. We need to put them on the launching pad with all other children so they can compete. That is what this amendment does. It targets the money to those kids who most need the help. 
   Finally, it takes the resources that we are providing them and focuses those resources in the places where they will do the most good. 
   So these five components are things that all will go toward improving our public school system: more resources; local control where we want the control to be; accountability, holding school systems responsible for performing; making sure the resources are focused; and making sure they are targeted at those kids who are most in need. 
   We need to show, in this body, that we are committed to the single most important thing we do in this country, which is educating our kids.

   Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, I would like to discuss very briefly the Torricelli-Edwards amendment on hurricane relief. First of all, let me say what is happening in North Carolina, 7 months after the hurricane hit. We still have more than 8,000 people who live in trailers that have been provided by FEMA. We have many other people who are living with families and friends. We have roads and bridges that were washed out by the flood that are still not repaired. We have, literally, towns that have been wiped out, places such as Princeville, Tarboro, all smaller towns in eastern North Carolina, that were devastated. 
   The people whose lives have been destroyed in North Carolina as a result of Hurricane Floyd are completely innocent. They are people who for generations have been law-abiding, taxpaying citizens, and for the first time in their lives, instead of writing tax checks to go to Washington, they are asking for something in return. If our Government cannot respond to a crisis such as Hurricane Floyd, we serve absolutely no purpose. 
   Our people in North Carolina are hurting and they need help. This amendment provides for $250 million for those programs that would best address the needs of the people in 13 States, not only North Carolina, that were devastated by Hurricane Floyd. 
   These are the components. First, $50 million for economic development. These communities that have been destroyed need long-term relief plans, and they need the resources to develop and implement those plans. Places such as Princeville and Tarboro that were literally completely wiped out by the hurricane have lost wastewater treatment plants, plants that have to be replaced. We have to provide the resources for that. 
   There is $150 million in community block grants. North Carolina has imminent emergency housing needs. Our State has responded by providing millions and millions and millions of dollars in State money to help with these needs. These are people who were in rental housing who have no place to live now. That rental housing will never be replaced if we do not provide the resources to do it. It is going to leave literally thousands of North Carolinians with no place to live, without a home--families totally wiped out. 
   Finally, there is $50 million for community facilities in a grant program which is specifically designed to address the needs of individual communities. For example, Princeville lost its fire station; the town of Windsor lost its library. These are things that need to be replaced, and these folks need help. 
   My people in North Carolina do not ask this Senate for a handout. They are doing everything they know how to do. The people of North Carolina have responded heroically to this tragedy. The State of North Carolina has responded by providing hundreds of millions of dollars--unprecedented in the history of this country. All they are saying now is that it is time for the Federal Government in Washington to respond in a responsible way, and to provide these folks whose lives have been devastated, whose communities have been completely wiped out, with the help they so desperately need. 
   They are not asking for a handout. They are asking us to do what any responsible Federal Government would do under these circumstances, which is to provide them with the resources to put themselves back on their feet.

   Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Bingaman amendment. The single most important thing we do as a government is educate our young people. What we should be doing and talking about today in this debate is making this decade ``the education decade.'' 
   We have in the United States the best roads, the best technology, and the best economy. But we don't have the best schools. We should be working toward making our schools the envy of the world. 
   I intend to submit a sense-of-the-Senate amendment later during the course of this debate which provides that 10 percent of the non-Social Security surplus will be devoted to education. I think it is the kind of statement that we as a body need to make to show the American people we are committed to providing the resources that are necessary to educate our young people. 
   If I can make just one comment in response to the Senator's remarks, what we are talking about in this debate is simply providing the resources for the programs that are so desperately needed, which I will talk about in just a minute. We are not talking about placing bureaucratic restrictions on State and local school districts. I believe very strongly that we don't want our school systems run out of Washington. In fact, we need our school systems to be run at the State and local level. We need to be sure they have the flexibility to make the decisions about what is best for their schools. I support that. We support that. 
   The issue we are debating today is whether we are going to provide in this budget process the resources that are so desperately needed in our public schools today. If we don't provide these resources, it is going to be impossible for our children to compete in the world. There is no doubt that they will be required to compete in a global economy. Our responsibility is to give them the tools to compete. They will not have the tools to compete unless we provide the resources that are so desperately needed by our public schools. 
   I would like to talk briefly about four areas. 
   First, afterschool programs: We have thousands and thousands of children all over this country who are on the waiting list to get into afterschool programs. 
   I actually have some firsthand experience with afterschool programs because my wife and I helped start an afterschool program in Raleigh, NC. 
   We have computers, we have technology, and volunteer tutors help children to learn technology, help them with their homework, help them prepare for tests. I have been able to see firsthand what happens when kids are put on a level playing field and they are all given a chance. 
   We know the time kids are most likely to get in trouble is between the time they get out of school and the time their parents get home from work. It is nobody's fault their parents have to work. We ought to give the kids a safe place to go, a safe environment where they can continue to learn and continue to be productive; equally important, give them a sense of self-esteem and make them believe they have an equal opportunity to compete against all the students around them. I have seen firsthand what happens. Their self-esteem grows, their self-image grows; as a result, their engagement grows and their grades improve. It happens over and over and over. 
   That is why afterschool programs are so important. This is not about a line item on a budget, this is about the lives of our children. 
   Class size: Every teacher I encounter tells me they feel as if they are babysitting. It is impossible for them to teach when they have 30, 32, 33 children in a classroom. We have to do something about that. 
   We have trouble attracting good teachers. We have trouble retaining good teachers. Our responsibility is to give teachers the tools they need to do the job they want to do. They are professionals. They are professionals who are in this business because they want to educate kids. We have to give them an environment that allows them to be effective. That is what reducing class size is about. Making our kids effective, allowing kids to have access to the teachers they say they so desperately want to have access to so they can learn--that is what this debate is about. 
   School construction and modernization: Just a few weeks ago, I was at Wayside Elementary School in Statesville, NC, a small, overcrowded, school built more than 50 years ago. They have literally put pieces of carpet all over the floor to cover asbestos tiles. The roof is leaking. The children have to go outside in order to go to the bathrooms. There are trailers, mobile homes, everywhere. The teachers who teach in that school a couple years ago got an incentive bonus. These are already underpaid teachers, but instead of keeping the bonus money for themselves and their families, they turned their bonuses back in to be used at the school. It is obvious these teachers are committed to the young people whom they are trying to educate. These kids cannot learn in a school that is falling apart. They cannot learn when they are sitting on top of each other in classrooms. 
   What kind of message does it send to the American people when these kids go to the local mall, all the stores are beautiful and shiny and new and well built, and then they go to Wayside Elementary School, the building is falling apart, patches of carpet are everywhere, the roof is leaking, and in order to go to the bathroom they have to go outside? 
   We need to do something about this. We need to put our kids in good quality buildings. We need to modernize the schools. We need to do it in a fiscally responsible and sound way. It is critically important we put our kids and our teachers in an environment where they can learn--the teachers can teach and the kids can learn. 
   Finally, Title I: Visit the schools in North Carolina, and the one thing you learn immediately is, we don't have a level playing field. There are some schools in Wake County and Mecklenburg County, Raleigh, and Charlotte that are beautiful and new with lots of technology. Go out into the rural areas of North Carolina, and we find schools that are falling apart, where they can't keep teachers. These are the schools at which Title I is aimed. 
   Title I has not been as successful as we would like in some areas. Although it has done very good things, there is more that needs to be done. We need to make sure a child living in the country in North Carolina has just as good an opportunity to learn as a child who lives in Raleigh or Charlotte. There is absolutely no reason that a child who is born in Raleigh, NC, should have an opportunity for a better education than a child who is born in rural North Carolina. That is what Title I is about. It is about leveling the playing field.  
   There is nothing more important we can do in the Senate this year than focus on education. We must send a clear and unmistakable message to the American people that we are willing to do whatever is necessary, financially and otherwise, to support our public school system, to educate our children, to give our children a chance to compete against every other child in this global economy. That is what we should be talking about today. That is what we should be debating. More importantly, that is what we should be committing to do in this budget process. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, I rise today to express how pleased I am that we will be passing S. 835, the Estuary Habitat Restoration Partnership Act of 1999. This legislation, introduced by our former colleague Sen. John Chafee, will reauthorize the National Estuary Program at $25 million annually and will allow these funds to be used to help implement and develop estuary management plans. It will also set a goal of restoring 1 million acres of estuary habitat over the next decade. 
   I am proud to be a cosponsor of this important legislation because it will help us restore and protect our nation's estuaries. Too many of our estuaries are endangered by various forms of pollution or from overuse and development. In North Carolina, we are still dealing with the effects of last year's devastating hurricane season; the full effect on places like the Albemarle and Pamlico Sounds are still being evaluated. This legislation will enable estuaries like the Albemarle and Pamlico Sounds to implement the restoration and management plans that were developed several years ago. This legislation will help make them healthier, more ecologically productive estuarine habitats. 
   Estuaries are home to a remarkably diverse wildlife population, and they provide a ``safe haven'' for plant and animal species, many of which are endangered. They are essential habitats for many young fish species who need clean and healthy estuaries to spawn. They are also an important resting spot for many migratory bird species. 
   Estuaries are critical not only to environmental health, but to economic health as well. They support commercial activities, such as shipping and fishing. They are a source of drinking water for coastal areas. They also provide recreation opportunities for residents and visitors who want to boat, fish, or birdwatch. 
   In my state of North Carolina, our estuaries are of vital importance. North Carolina's estuarine system is the second largest in the continental United States, encompassing more than 2.2 million acres. Our coastal waters produce more than half the fish caught on the East Coast. North Carolina is also home to one of the last bay scallop fisheries in the United States. This industry depends upon submerged aquatic seagrasses that are extremely sensitive to pollution and they must be protected. Our estuary system is also home to large number of pelicans, who years ago were nearly extinct but have now rebounded dramatically in their restored habitat. Nearly ten percent of North Carolina's coastal estuaries have been designated as ``Outstanding Resource Waters'' by the state Environmental Management Commission. These waters are some of the most valuable in the state, indeed in the nation. I believe we must fight hard to protect them for the future. This legislation will help us do that. 
   The National Estuary Program has enabled nearly thirty estuaries to develop restoration and management plans--including the Albemarle and Pamlico Sounds in North Carolina. This legislation is an important component to insuring the continued good health of these estuaries, and I am extremely pleased to see it pass the Senate. 
   Finally, Mr. President, I'd like to say a few words about the man who introduced this legislation, our friend and colleague, Senator John Chafee. Senator Chafee was able to be a nonpartisan voice of reason on a great many issues. I miss him dearly. This legislation is a tribute to his perseverance and ability to develop legislation that we all recognize as a benefit to our nation as a whole. I thank him for his dedication, and I am pleased that Senator LINCOLN CHAFEE is on hand for the passage of this important measure. 
   I ask unanimous consent that my statement be placed in the RECORD following the remarks of Senator CHAFEE on this legislation.

   Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, I rise today in support of legislation Senator Santorum and I are introducing, the ``Deposit Insurance Fairness and Economic Opportunity Act.'' This legislation would increase the amount of money that is available for banks and thrifts to lend in their communities. 
   Our financial services industry is incredibly strong, and the public benefits from this strength. Last year, this Senate passed comprehensive banking reform legislation that will increase consumer choice and make our financial institutions more competitive. Throughout the consideration of that measure, I steadfastly supported efforts to improve and increase credit availability to local communities. Though I believe we achieved this goal, I also said that we could and should do more. The legislation I introduce today with my colleague Senator Santorum does just that. 
   This measure would use the extra money that is in the Bank Insurance Fund (BIF) and the Savings Association Insurance Fund (SAIF), money that banks and thrifts have paid, to pay the interest on Financing Corporation (FICO) bonds. As a result, banks and thrifts will be able to use the money they would otherwise pay to  FICO to increase lending in their communities. Right now, a financial institution of approximately $200 million in domestic deposits could expect to pay roughly $42,000 this year for its FICO obligation. If that $42,000 obligation can be paid out of our excess money in the insurance funds, without compromising the safety and soundness of the funds, it will mean that institution has $42,000 more to lend. 
   Right now, the BIF and the SAIF are beyond fully capitalized. They both contain millions of dollars more than required by federal law. That excess money is sitting here in Washington. The funds keep growing, and the money keeps sitting here. Now, the trouble with pots of money sitting in Washington is that quite often, the money just stays here in Washington and doesn't help our communities. This legislation would change that. By relieving some of the financial burden on our banks and thrifts through this common-sense legislation, we will be opening up opportunities for these institutions to put that money to good use. 
   The $42,000 saved in my example could translate into hundreds of thousands of dollars more in available credit. This means money available to help folks in eastern North Carolina rebuild their homes and lives after Hurricane Floyd. This means money to help revitalize inner-city neighborhoods. This means more money to help farmers who have suffered crop damage. And it means money to help more Americans know the joys of home ownership. 
   I would like to say a few words about safety and solvency of the insurance funds. These funds, the BIF and SAIF, are administered by the FDIC and are used to pay insured depositors in the event of a bank or thrift failure. I am pleased to say that in these booming economic times, both funds are well above their statutorily required level. Current law requires each fund to have 1.25 percent of all insured deposits. Right now, the BIF and SAIF are both well above this level, and the funds are growing. 
   In this legislation, we take great care to recognize the importance of protecting the insurance funds. In fact, we actually build in an additional cushion to help insure the solvency of the funds. Only if the funds are above 1.4 percent will excess money above that level be used to pay the FICO obligation. Moreover, we maintain the authority and ability of the FDIC to make necessary adjustments to the funds to protect their solvency, should the need arise. 
   Right now, the money is sitting in an account here in Washington. I think it can be put to better use in local communities. This legislation represents a method to help do just that, without sacrificing the safety and soundness protections that are currently in place.

   Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, I am proud to join my colleagues today--Republicans and Democrats alike--in voting to repeal the Social security earnings test. For 75 years now, Congress has kept a provision in the Social Security program that hurts our seniors who continue to work. The Senior Citizens Freedom to Work Act is a sensible measure. It will correct an injustice in our Social Security program, infuse our tight labor market with experienced workers, and most importantly, help hundreds of thousands of seniors become more financially secure. 
   Currently, retirees drawing Social Security benefits are subject to an earnings test. This means that for seniors ages 65 to 69, benefits are deferred by $1 for every $3 that their earnings exceed $17,000. In my state, nearly 2,500 seniors are hurt by the Social Security earnings test. According to the Social Security Administration, the average amount of benefits lost per recipient in 1995 was $3,596. My state benefits from the contributions of these employees, substantively and economically; yet these individuals are being penalized for their efforts. 
   It is now time for Congress to bring the Social Security program into a new era. Retiring the earnings test, not our seniors, is a first step. 
   In 1935, when the Social Security program was established, the United States had a crowded labor field. The earnings test was designed to encourage seniors to leave the work force to open their jobs to younger people. But today the rationale for the test has faded. It's about time we replaced this antiquated provision. 
   Indeed, no one today would seriously consider structuring the program to discourage older workers. Our unemployment rate is at an historic low. And our country is enjoying unprecedented economic prosperity. Seniors bring years of experience to the work force--knowledge and judgment that cannot be obtained from a textbook, but only from first-hand experience. Employers today are seeking skilled, dependable, and honest employees. Many older Americans would be willing to fill this need if they were not faced with decreased Social Security benefits. The government should not tell people who want to work that they cannot, but this is exactly the message the earnings test sends to many seniors. This message is discriminatory and fundamentally wrong. 
   Moreover, at a time when we are experiencing such phenomenal economic growth, many of our senior citizens are struggling to pay for everyday needs. This measure will help them. I have heard from hundreds of seniors from North Carolina who are struggling to pay their medical bills and daily living costs. By now, they have been working and paying Social Security taxes for decades. These same seniors are the ones who start to lose benefits because they continue to work, simply because they earn a salary that the government believes is too high for them. 
   It must be said that this legislation is a patch to one problem in the Social Security system that is currently riddled with holes. If Congress does not start considering overall Social Security reform, we will eventually have a hole too big to fix. It is my hope that  the current momentum to fix small holes in the system will lead to a larger dialogue on how to save the Social Security program. 
   But until then, the Senior Citizens Freedom to Work Act is a win-win measure. It lets seniors earn a higher salary without retribution. It keeps skilled employees in the workplace. It helps maintain a strong economy. It helps our seniors to afford today's cost of living. And finally, it's the right thing to do. 
   This bill has a lot of benefits, and it costs the government nothing. I look forward to its quick passage in the Senate and to the positive effects that it will have for our country.

   Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleague, Senator HAGEL, submit the National Fragile X Awareness Week Resolution. This measure will establish July 17 through July 23 as National Fragile X Awareness Week. 
   Fragile X is the leading known cause of mental retardation. Despite the devastating impact of the disease, the disorder is relatively unknown to many, even in the medical community, largely due to its fairly recent discovery. 
   Today, one in 2,000 males and one in 4,000 females have the gene defect. One in every 260 women is a carrier. Current studies estimate that as many as 90,000 Americans suffer from Fragile X, yet up to 80 to 90 percent of them are undiagnosed. It does not effect one racial or ethnic group more than another, and it is found in every socioeconomic group. 
   Scientists have only known exactly what causes Fragile X since 1991. The disorder results from a defect in a single gene. Other diseases caused by single gene defects include cystic fibrosis and muscular dystrophy. In fact, the incidence of Fragile X is similar to that of cystic fibrosis. 
   Fragile X occurs when a specific gene, which should hold a string of molecules that repeat six to fifty times, over-expands, causing the gene to hold anywhere from 200 to 1,000 copies of the same sequence, repeating over and over, much like a record skipping out of control. The result of this error is that instructions needed for the creation of a specific protein in the brain are lost. Consequently, the Fragile X protein is either low or absent in the affected person. The lower the level of the protein, the more severe the resulting disabilities. 
   People with Fragile X have effects ranging from mild learning disabilities to severe mental retardation. Behavioral problems associated with Fragile X include aggression, anxiety, and seizures. The effects on both the victims of the disorder and their families are profound, taking a huge emotional and financial toll. People with Fragile X have a normal life expectancy but usually incur special costs that on average add up to over $2 million over their lifetime. Because it is inherited, many families have more than one child with Fragile X. 
   Recent advances in Fragile X research now make it possible to test definitively for the disorder through DNA analysis. Yet many 
   doctors are still not familiar with Fragile X, and subtle symptoms in early childhood can make it difficult to detect. 
   Today, in our country, thousands of children have Fragile X, but their parents have never heard of the disease. These parents know something is wrong, but they cannot give the problem a name, and neither can any doctor they have consulted. They may know their child has mental retardation, but they do not know why. They do not know that if they have more children, those children may also be at risk. They do not know there are treatments for the problem. They do not know that someone is working on a cure. 
   the same holds true for many adults in our society. They are living in group homes and in institutions around the country. They have been cared for during entire lifetimes by devoted family members. Yet they have never had a diagnosis beyond ``mental retardation.'' 
   The need to raise the profile of Fragile X across our nation is clear. The impact of the current lack of understanding of this disorder is that all too often it is years before the diagnosis is made. As a result, early intervention and treatment are delayed--treatment that could help to mitigate the effects of the disorder. 
   We also hope that by raising awareness we can communicate the good news about Fragile X. Now that scientists have identified the missing protein that causes the disorder, there is hope for a cure. And because Fragile X is the only single-gene disease known to directly impact human intelligence, understanding the disease can give us insight into human intelligence and learning and into dealing with other single gene defects. Understanding Fragile X may also unlock some of the mysteries of autism, schizophrenia, and other neurological disorders. But we need to fund research efforts into this devastating disease. 
   Mr. President, this resolution seeks to raise awareness in both the general population and the medical community about the presence and effects of Fragile X. By doing so, we hope to promote earlier diagnosis of the disease, more effective treatment, and support for research that will one day lead to a cure.

    Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, today with my colleagues Senator LAUTENBERG and Senator TORRICELLI, I introduce the College Fire Prevention Act. This measure would provide federal matching grants for the installation of fire sprinkler systems in college and university dormitories and fraternity and sorority houses. 
   Mr. President, the tragic fire that occurred at Seton Hall University on Wednesday, January 19th of this year will not be long forgotten. Sadly, three freshman, all 18 years old, died. Fifty-four students, two South Orange firefighters and two South Orange police officers were injured. The dormitory, Boland Hall, was a six-story, 350 room structure built in 1952 that housed approximately 600 students. Astonishingly, the fire was contained to the third floor lounge of Boland Hall. This dormitory was equipped with smoke alarms but no sprinkler system. 
   Unfortunately, the Boland Hall fire was not the first of its kind. And it reminded many people in North Carolina of their own tragic experience with dorm fires. In 1996, on Mother's Day and Graduation Day, a fire in the Phi Gamma Delta fraternity house at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill killed five college juniors and injured three others. This fraternity house was 70 years old. The National Fire Protection Association identified several factors that contributed to the tragic fire, including the lack of fire sprinkler protection. 
   Sadly, there have been countless other dorm fires. On December 9, 1997, a student died in a dormitory fire at Greenville College in Greenville, Illinois. The dormitory, Kinney Hall, was built in the 1960s and had no fire sprinkler system. On January 10, 1997, a student died at the University of Tennessee at Martin. The dormitory, Ellington Hall, had no fire sprinkler system. On January 3, 1997, a student died in a dormitory fire at Central Missouri State University in Warrensburg, Missouri. On October 21, 1994, five students died in a fraternity house fire in Bloomsburg, Pennsylvania. The list goes on and on. In a typical year between 1980 and 1997, the National Fire Protection Association estimates there were an average of 1,800 fires at dormitories, fraternities, and sororities, involving 1 death, 69 injuries, and 8.1 million dollars in property damage. 
   So now we must ask, what can be done? What can we do to curtail these tragic fires from taking the lives of our children . . . our young adults? We should focus our attention on the lack of fire sprinklers in college dormitories and fraternity and sorority houses. Sprinklers save lives. Indeed, the National Fire Protection Association has never recorded a fire that killed more than 2 people in a public assembly, educational, institutional, or residential building where a sprinkler system was operating properly. 
   Despite the clear benefits of sprinklers, many college dorms do not have them. New dormitories are generally required to have advanced safety systems such as fire sprinklers. But such requirements are rarely imposed retroactively on existing buildings. In 1997, over 90 percent of the campus building fires reported to fire departments occurred in buildings where there were smoke alarms present. However, only 28 percent of them had fire sprinklers present. 
   At my state's flagship university at Chapel Hill, for example, only six of the 29 residence halls have sprinklers. A report published by The Raleigh News & Observer in the wake of the Seton Hall fire also noted that only seven of 19 dorms at North Carolina State University are equipped with the life-saving devices, and there are sprinklers in two of the 10 dorms at North Carolina Central University. At Duke University, only five of 26 dorms have sprinklers. 
   Mr. President, the legislation I introduce today authorizes the Secretary of Education, in consultation with the United States Fire Administration, to award grants, on a competitive basis, to States, private or public colleges or universities, fraternities, or sororities to assist them in providing fire sprinkler systems for their student housing and dormitories. These entities would be required to produce matching funds equal to one-half of the cost. This legislation authorizes $100 million for fiscal years 2001 through 2005. 
   In North Carolina, we decided to initiate a drive to install sprinklers in our public college and university dorms. The overall cost is estimated at $57.5 million. Given how much it is going to cost North Carolina's public colleges and universities to install sprinklers, I think it's clear that the $100 million that this measure authorizes is just a drop in the bucket. But my hope is that by providing this small incentive we can encourage more colleges to institute a comprehensive review of their dorm's fire safety and to install sprinklers. All they need is a helping hand. With this modest measure of prevention, we can help prevent the needless and tragic loss of young lives. 
   Mr. President, parents should not have to worry about their children living in fire traps. When we send our children away to college, we are sending them to a home away from home where hundreds of other students eat, sleep, burn candles, use electric appliances and smoke. We must not compromise on their safety. As the Fire Chief from Chapel Hill wrote me: ``Parents routinely send their children off  to college seeking an education unaware that one of the greatest dangers facing their children is the fire hazards associated with dormitories, fraternity and sorority houses and other forms of student housing........The only complete answer to making student-housing safe is to install fire sprinkler systems.'' In short, the best way to ensure the protection of our college students is to install fire sprinklers in our college dormitories and fraternity and sorority houses. My proposal has been endorsed by the National Fire Protection Association and the College Parents of America. I ask all of my colleagues to join me in supporting this important legislation. Thank you.

   Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, I thank Dr. Ogilvie for helping work to get Dr. Elliott here this morning. Dr. Ogilvie has been a wonderful friend and counselor to me in the short time I have been here, and we are also very pleased to see he is doing well. 
   Dr. Elliott, the guest Chaplain today, is the minister of my home church, the church of which I am a member in Raleigh, NC. Edenton Street United Methodist Church is a church of which we are very proud--about 3,000 strong, I think, the last time I saw. He is here this morning with his lovely wife Jackie. We are very proud to have both of them with us. 
   The church itself, as I say, is a church of which we are extremely proud. It is a church that is involved in every aspect of ministering to the community in Raleigh and outside of Raleigh. Dr. Elliott has provided extraordinary leadership for this church. He has been a wonderful friend and counselor to myself and my family. 
   Dr. Elliott, I believe, received his doctorate degree from Duke University and did some postdoctoral study at Drew University. More important than that, though, is that he baptized both of my daughters, Emma Claire and Kate, of whom we are, of course, very proud. But most importantly, Dr. Elliott is a true messenger for God. He speaks the word of God rightly, and he inspires all of us; when he preaches on Sunday morning, we all come out knowing that God was present in our service. That is the most important thing I can say about Dr. Elliott. There is no finer Methodist anywhere, no finer minister anywhere, and I am very proud and honored to have him with us this morning to give the opening prayer.

    Mr. EDWARDS. 
   Mr. President, today I introduce two bills that are very important crime fighting measures. My legislation will help provide law enforcement with additional assistance in locating missing people. One bill, the ``Abducted Young Adults Act,'' will give the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children the legal authority to assist law enforcement officers in locating abducted young adults aged 18 through 21. The second bill, ``Kristen's Law,'' authorizes the Attorney General to provide grants to public agencies and nonprofit private organizations that help find missing adults. 
   Mr. President, let me tell you a story about a girl from my State of North Carolina. Her name is Kristen Modafferi. Kristen was a bright, hard-working student at North Carolina State University. After finishing up her freshman year of college, she traveled to San Francisco to spend the summer taking a photography class at Berkeley. Once Kristen arrived in San Francisco, she started her class and got a couple of jobs to help pay for her expenses. She was settling in and making friends. 
   On Monday, June 23, 1997, Kristen left work to visit a local beach. She has not been seen since. Kristen was three weeks over the age of 18 when she disappeared. 
   Law enforcement devoted a great deal of time to finding Kristen and should be commended for their efforts. Despite a number of leads, Kristen has never been found. 
   For 15 years, since the creation of the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, our Nation has recognized the vulnerability of young children to abductions and exploitation. We have provided the funding and support vital to ensuring rapid and multi jurisdictional responses to these cases. But in Kristen's case we could not--and all because she was 3 weeks past her 18th birthday. The charter for the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children only allows the Center to help law enforcement search for missing children aged 0 to 18. 
   When a person involuntarily disappears, time is of the essence. Search efforts must begin quickly, and they must reach across jurisdictions. Abducted youngsters are often taken across state lines. In order to effectively coordinate a search, the groups conducting the search must have an easy way to share information with each other, no matter how far away from one another they may be. The greater the number of agencies helping in the search, the more likely it is that the person will be found. But there is no central, federally-established organization that exists to aid law enforcement in their efforts to locate missing 18-21 year-olds. Unfortunately, Kristen's tragic story illustrates the need for such an organization. And what better way to fill this need than to build upon a reputable, federally-partnered organization--the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children--that already exists to search for missing individuals under 18? 
   The National Center for Missing and Exploited Children serves as the national clearinghouse for information on missing children and the prevention of child victimization. The Center works in partnership with the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention at the U.S. Department of Justice, and its mission is codified in federal law. 
   Because the Center was established for the purpose of assisting with cases that involve missing children under the age of 18, the Center does not typically assist with cases involving involuntarily missing college students and other people who happen to be 18 through 21 years old. The sad fact is that had Kristen been just a few weeks younger when she disappeared, the Center would have immediately mobilized to start a search. 
   One of the measures I introduce today, The Abducted Young Adults Act, would expand the Center's charter to allow it to use its expertise and resources to help find involuntarily missing young adults in the 18 through 21 year-old age group. 
   Mr. President, some people might inquire why I chose to limit expansion of the Center's mission by only covering individuals under age 22. For example, my bill would not affect the Center's ability to help police search for Kristen's sister Allison and other individuals who are 22 and over. The second bill I am introducing today, Kristen's Act, will help fill this gap. I will discuss that bill in a moment. However, the reason for my decision to limit the expansion of the Center's mission is twofold. 
   First, although a person is considered a legal adult when they attain the age of 18, I think most people would agree that college-aged kids are just that--kids. Members of this age group are particularly vulnerable to criminals and are frequently victims of crime. They are away from home for the first time in their lives, in an unfamiliar area, without the presence of their parents. I believe that most people would agree that this age group needs special protection. 
   Statistics demonstrate the need to address the issue of missing young adults and to find a way to provide some additional resources for this group. In fact, according to data from the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Sheriff's office in my state of North Carolina, in 1999, they received reports of 132 missing persons aged 18-21. That's the number for just one city, in just one state in the country. If we were to amass similar statistics for every jurisdiction across the country, I believe we would be astounded at the high rate of disappearances for this age group. For 
   example, in February, 1999, the FBI reported 1,896 new cases of missing 18 through 21-year-olds--1,896 new cases in just one month. This is a frighteningly large number. And I believe that the Abducted Young Adults Act is a necessary protective measure. It will provide some comfort to the millions of parents who send their children to  college every year and worry about their safety: If anything does happen, a national effort will be mobilized to help. 
   The second reason that the legislation would apply to a limited age group is that I believe the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children should stay focused on its central mission--to help search for missing children. 
   Since its founding, the Center has helped recover nearly 48,000 children. Imagine the benefit to families and law enforcement if the Center were to help search for abducted young adults. Surely the number of active missing young adult cases would decline if the Center helped with the search efforts. I believe my legislation is a logical extension of the Center's current mission. 
   My bill would authorize appropriations of $2.5 million per year through 2003 so that the Center does not have to divert any of the funding it needs to effectively search for children. I have worked closely with the Center's staff to ensure that my bill will enhance not harm the Center's current mission. As a result, the Abducted Young Adults Act is fully supported by the Center. 
   The Fraternal Order of Police (FOP) also strongly supports my legislation. Gilbert Gallegos, National President of the FOP, is a member of the Board of Directors for the Center. As he so aptly states in his letter of support for the bill, ``Just because you turn eighteen is no guarantee that you will not be the victim of a crime.'' 
   Mr. President, I believe that it is important to mention that it is true that some individuals aged 18 through 21 may disappear because they want to. Some of these individuals may live in abusive households. Others may want to start a new life. And because they are considered legal adults, they have the choice to remain missing. In these cases, it may not make sense for law enforcement, the Center, or anyone else to launch a search. 
   My legislation ensures that the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children will use its public resources to search for only those missing young adults aged 18-21 that law enforcement has first determined to be missing involuntarily. 
   Specifically, my bill says that in order for an individual to be defined as an involuntarily missing young adult, the following criteria must be met: (1) their whereabouts must be unknown to their parent or guardian; (2) law enforcement must have entered a missing persons report on the individual into the National Crime Information Center; and (3) there must be a reasonable indication or suspicion that the individual has been abducted or is missing under circumstances suggesting foul play or a threat to life; or (4) the individual is known to be suicidal or has a severe medical condition that poses a threat to his or her life. 
   I believe that the Abducted Young Adults Act is a common-sense way to help prevent further incidences like the one involving Kristen Modafferi. For every child the Center assists in locating, there are a handful of individuals that it cannot help find. If my bill enables the Center to help find just one more missing youngster, then I believe the bill will have succeeded in its goal. 
   I am pleased that the Abducted Young Adults Act is co-sponsored by Senator BIDEN. Senator BIDEN was instrumental to the establishment of the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, and I thank him for his leadership and support. 
   Mr. President, the Abducted Young Adults Act is only one part of the solution. The other part of the solution is to provide the organizations that are devoted to searching for missing adults with the resources they need to be more effective in their efforts to search for all adults, regardless of age. 
   That is why I am also introducing Kristen's Law, named after Kristen Modafferi. This bill has been introduced in the House of Representatives by Representative SUE MYRICK, and I thank her for her involvement in this issue. 
   As I mentioned, Kristen's Law would allow the Attorney General to make grants to public agencies or nonprofit private organizations to assist law enforcement and families in locating missing adults. Grants could also be used by these agencies and organizations for a number of other reasons. For example, funds could be used to maintain a national, interconnected database for the purpose of tracking missing adults who are determined by law enforcement to be endangered due to age, diminished mental capacity, or the circumstances of disappearance. And the grants could be used to help establish a national clearinghouse for missing adults and to assist with victim advocacy related to missing adults. 
   Generally, the greater the number of people conducting a search, the greater the chance is of locating missing individuals. The combination of the Abducted Young Adults Act and Kristen's Law sends a message to families that they deserve all of the help necessary to locate endangered and involuntarily missing loved ones. Together, these bills will help ensure that all endangered and involuntarily missing adults--regardless of age--will receive not only the benefit of search efforts by law enforcement, but also by experienced, specialized organizations.

   Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, the human suffering and devastation we incurred in North Carolina is absolutely unparalleled. Our people have never suffered and struggled the way they are suffering right now. This storm has completely devastated us. Our farmers are in the worst shape they have ever been in. 
   I appreciate very much the majority leader's commitment, Senator STEVENS' commitment, and the minority leader's commitment. We have talked throughout this process on a daily basis. We had an agreement, a commitment to two things, basically. One was a loan forgiveness program, which has been talked about, and, second, some language that would help the payment for structural damage on farms in North Carolina. 
   I appreciate very much the commitment we have received today. I do have to say I am counting on my colleagues' commitments--the majority leader's commitment, Senator STEVENS' commitment, Senator DASCHLE's commitment--to do everything in their power to get this thing passed in this Congress; that it will be included in the CR we are discussing right now and that, when it goes to the House side, the majority leader will speak to the Speaker. We will do everything in our power, Senator HELMS and myself, to make sure that happens. But it is critical to Senator HELMS and me that we not need to rely on the commitment to do something after the first of the year, that we get this done tonight or tomorrow. 
   With that, I thank the majority leader.

   Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, I have spoken before on the floor about the devastation created by Hurricane Floyd in my State of North Carolina. Let me update and speak briefly on that subject, particularly since we are in the process of a continuing resolution right now. 
   Everybody knows, because they have seen the pictures on television, what happened to my families in North Carolina as a result of Hurricane Floyd. We have two huge issues that have to be addressed before this Congress adjourns. One is housing. We have people in eastern North Carolina who don't have homes and have no prospect of having homes any time in the foreseeable future. We have to address this housing situation in North Carolina before we adjourn. 
   Second is our farmers. Our farmers were already in desperate straits long before Hurricane Floyd came through, and they have been totally devastated as a result of Hurricane Floyd. We have to address the needs of our farmers in eastern North Carolina before we leave Washington and before the Congress adjourns. 
   Let me say, first, that we have, in the last 24 hours, made progress on both fronts. First, on the issue of housing, we have, at least in principle, reached agreement that FEMA will have an additional $215 million of authority--money already appropriated--for housing buyouts. Based on the information we presently have, that should get us well into next year in the process of participating in the housing buyouts and helping all of our folks who desperately need help. That is good progress, a move in the right direction. There is more work that needs to be done. But at least in terms of getting us through the winter, I think we have probably done what we need to do in terms of housing. 
   On the issue of our farmers and agriculture, there is at least in principle an agreement for approximately $554 million of additional agricultural relief. 
   My concern has been and continues to be whether that money, No. 1, will go to North Carolina and North Carolina's farmers; and, No. 2, whether it addresses the very specific needs that our farmers have. 
   We are now in the process of working with everyone involved in these budget negotiations to ensure that both of those problems are addressed: 
   No. 1, to make sure that a substantial chunk of that money goes to North Carolina, and that additional money, to the extent it is needed for very specific purposes, can be appropriated and allocated to North Carolina's farmers to deal with the devastation created by Hurricane Floyd; 
   No. 2, to make sure at least a portion of the money that has already been appropriated goes to address the very specific needs our farmers have. 
   It is absolutely critical that before the Senate adjourns and before this Congress adjourns and leaves Washington these two problems be addressed. 
   I said it before; I will say it again. Our government serves no purpose if we are not available to meet the needs of our citizens who have been devastated by disasters--in this case, Hurricane Floyd. These are people who have worked their entire lives--in the case of our farmers, they have farmed the land for generations. They have paid their taxes. They have been good citizens. They have always lived up to their end of the bargain. 
   What they say to us now is: What is their government-- 
   because this is their government--going to do to deal with their needs in this time of greatest need in the wake of Hurricane Floyd and disasters created by Hurricane Floyd? 
   We have a responsibility to these people. We need to make sure their needs at least have been addressed through the winter. When we come back in the spring--we will be back in the spring, I assure my colleagues--we will be talking to our colleagues again about what additional needs we have because we will have additional long-term needs. This problem is not going to be solved in a month. It is not going to be solved in 3 months. This will take a period of years. When Congress comes back in the spring, there will be many additional needs that will have to be addressed. 
   But at a bare minimum, we need to ensure this Congress does not adjourn and people do not go home until we have made sure we have at least addressed the housing needs which will get us through the winter--I think we have made real progress in that direction--and, second, that we have gotten our farmers back up on their feet so they can be back in business in the spring in order for them to continue their farming operation. Those two problems have to be addressed before we leave. 
   Let me make clear what I have made clear before, which is my people are in trouble. They are hurting. They need help. Senator HELMS and I have worked together very diligently to try to get them the help they need in this time of crisis. 
   I want to make it clear once again that I intend to use whatever tool is available to me to ensure that my people get the help they need and the help they deserve. 
   This Congress and this Senate cannot go home and cannot leave Washington until we ensure that our people in North Carolina have a home to go to. 
   Thank you, Mr. President.

   Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, we are about to pass a resolution to keep the Government operating for approximately a week. The question I ask is, What are we doing for the victims of Hurricane Floyd? Keeping this Government open is not important unless it does the things it should and needs to do for its citizens. 
   We keep telling the people of this country that this is their Government, it belongs to them. Every week they get their paycheck, and they have a huge deduction for Federal taxes. They wonder every time they get their paycheck and their paycheck stub where that money is going. 
   The truth is, now is the time, in the wake of the devastation of Hurricane Floyd, when they are entitled to expect their Government will respond and respond in a responsible way to what has been done to them. 
   The people of eastern North Carolina--I know because I have been there over and over, including this past weekend--are wondering how they are going to make it through the winter. They are completely and totally innocent. These are people who had a hurricane drop inches and inches of water on them. It devastated their homes and, thereby, devastated their lives. In many cases, it devastated their workplaces. 
   What they are saying to us now is: What is my Government to which I have been paying taxes for all these years going to do? The reality is, if the Government does not respond to this disaster and this terrible situation, the Government serves no purpose. 
   We had 50 people die in North Carolina as a result of this hurricane and 5 people are still missing. We have 3,000 people who are still in temporary housing. More than 30,000 homes have been damaged and approximately 20,000 have been completely destroyed. The damage estimate for housing alone is approximately $400 million, and that number will grow. We have eight counties that still have damaged water systems where people are required to boil their water to use it. 
   Over 2 months after this hurricane ravaged eastern North Carolina, our people are still struggling and suffering and will continue to struggle as we go forward. 
   I ask my colleagues these questions: 
   No. 1, do they take for granted the roof over their heads? 
   No. 2, do they assume when they turn the tap on that they will be able to drink the water that comes out of that tap? 
   And No. 3, do they assume their children will be able to go to school? 
   Let me tell my friends and colleagues in the Senate that there are tens of thousands of North Carolinians who no longer take those things for granted and no longer assume they are going to be able to do those things because they know they cannot. The question they ask me and, more important, the question they ask us as their representatives in this Government is, What are we going to do to respond to what has happened to them? 
   We have kids in eastern North Carolina who are going to school in small trailers in a gravel parking lot of the National Guard grounds in Tarboro. In order to go to the restroom, they have to leave these small trailers and travel to the one small trailer that has a restroom. They are already going to school in little trailers on a gravel parking lot, and there is not even a restroom in the trailer they are using for a classroom. In order to use the restroom, they have to leave their trailer and go down the parking lot to another small trailer. 
   The water rose in this area, for example, 88 inches in an elementary school in Tarboro. The school was completely destroyed. 
   Transportation--we have more than 90 sections of State roads and 12 bridges still washed out. 
   Agriculture--our farmers are hurting as they have never hurt before. Before this hurricane went through eastern North Carolina, our farmers were teetering on the edge from low crop prices and 
   many years of having a very difficult time financially. 
   What is the effect of a hurricane coming through? This is the time of year when many of our farmers in eastern North Carolina would be doing the bulk of their work. They would be harvesting their crops. Not this year. Many of our farmers have lost all of their crops. The current crop loss estimate is $543 million--over $ 1/2 billion. The livestock loss is estimated at about $2 million. We have more than $200 million in damage to structures on farms, the structures that are necessary for these farmers to operate their farms day to day. Many of these structures have been destroyed. 
   In addition, they have lost the machinery that is necessary to operate their farms on a daily basis. In almost all cases, the structures are not covered by insurance, and, in many cases, the machinery is not covered by insurance. 
   The bottom line is we have many farmers in eastern North Carolina who have lost their crops. They have lost the buildings from which they operate and they have lost the machinery they use to farm. They are out of business. What they say to us in Washington is: What is my Government going to do to respond? I have paid my taxes. I have been a good, law-abiding citizen all these years, and I have always been told this is my Government. So my question to Washington now is, What is my Government going to do to respond? 
   The reality is, nobody in North Carolina is asking for a handout. Our people have responded heroically to this situation. Our businesses have been extraordinary. 
   They have made millions and millions of dollars worth of donations to help the people who have been devastated by Hurricane Floyd. Our individual citizens have made contributions. They have not only made contributions with funds to help the victims of Hurricane Floyd, they have taken time off from work, with their employers' permission; they are taking their weekends and their time off to go to eastern North Carolina to work to try to help the folks who have been devastated. They have done everything they can. Every person in North Carolina is doing what they can to help our people who have been damaged by this storm. 
   That is not enough. We need this Government to respond in a way that addresses the needs. 
   No. 1, we need housing relief. We have thousands of families who have lost their homes as a result of this storm. They have no way to rebuild their homes and rebuild their lives without our assistance. It is assistance to which they are entitled. They have paid their taxes all these years, never knowing this disaster, this devastation was coming. Now that it has hit them, it is time for this Government to respond and to get them back into houses. 
   They do not need help 6 months from now or a year from now; they need help right now. Right now is the time they are living in small trailers, on gravel parking lots. They want to get back into a home, a real home, the kind of home they had before Hurricane Floyd came. We have a responsibility to do everything we can to put them in those homes. 
   Agriculture: We have over 25,000 farmers who desperately need help just to make it through the winter. I am talking about an intense and immediate financial crisis that our farmers are confronted with. 
   So we have two things we must do before we go home. We have to address the housing needs in North Carolina, people who are not going to be able to get through the winter unless we do something for them; and, secondly, we have to help our farmers who are already in trouble and have been completely devastated. 
   I want us to compare the needs and the devastation in eastern North Carolina to some of the things on which we spend money. While I am strongly in support of spending funds for the defense of this country, we have spent  billions of dollars on projects the Pentagon did not ever suggest they wanted. We have spent hundreds of millions of dollars on relocating bureaucrats and renovating or restoring Federal buildings, millions on debt forgiveness for foreign governments, tens of millions on foreign cultural exchange programs, and on top of all that, a congressional pay raise. 
   Surely these folks in North Carolina, whose lives have been devastated--totally innocent victims of Hurricane Floyd--are entitled to at least that level of priority. Those are things we have already done. And we ought to do things for these Third World countries. We ought to do things to help other countries that are in need. But the reality is, we have North Carolinians and Americans who are in desperate straits. They do not have anyplace to live. We have farmers who are literally out of business. Their families have, for generations, farmed the land of eastern North Carolina, and they are now out of business. 
   It is time for their Government to step to the plate and do the responsible thing, to give them the help they need to put our folks in eastern North Carolina back into houses, to put our farmers back on their feet and back in business. 
   If we cannot do that, what function do we serve as a Government? For all those people who, for all these years, we have been saying, this is your Government; this is not some foreign thing up in Washington that has nothing to do with your lives, now they are asking us to make good on that promise and to make good on our responsibility to them for all their years--year in and year out--of doing the responsible thing: Paying their taxes and being good Americans. 
   So I close by saying, I understand that we are nearing the end of this session. I understand the needs and priorities on which we are all focused: Education, health care, responsible fixes for the BBA, and hospitals and health care providers around this country. We have many needs that need to be addressed. 
   But I want to make clear that when it comes to Hurricane Floyd and my people in North Carolina who do not have a place to live and are worried about getting through this winter, and our farmers who are literally out of business, that I intend to use absolutely everything at my disposal and to take whatever action is necessary to assure that our people in North Carolina are taken care of. 
   Thank you, Mr. President.

   Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act. This legislation is of critical importance to America and will benefit our nation's financial services companies and American consumers. Quite simply, I believe it helps pave the way to our continued economic prosperity. 
   This legislation will ensure stronger consumer protections in the rapidly changing and consolidating world of financial services. The legislation is important to consumers, because the industry is already changing dramatically, but through regulatory backdoors and without much-needed consumer protections. Banks, securities firms, and insurance companies--historically separated from one another--have already started engaging in each others' business, and there have been no affirmative protections in place for the nation's consumers. This law rectifies that situation. 
   I do have some concerns with certain sections regarding federal preemption of state laws that I hope to clarify. Throughout consideration of this legislation--S. 900, H.R. 10, and the chairmen's mark--I have worked with my colleagues to make sure that the final language of the bill does not adversely affect recently passed consumer protection legislation in my home state of North Carolina. 
   North Carolina is a leading state in the financial services world on several fronts. We are home to some of the largest banks in the country. We are home to some of the strongest and most innovative community development groups in the country. We see, every day, how well these players work with one another to provide convenient banking services to all North Carolinians. 
   North Carolina is also a leader in consumer protections. Our state General Assembly recently passed two important pieces of consumer legislation that had broad support. First, the General Assembly passed legislation that will require Blue Cross/Blue Shield of North Carolina--a non-profit--to create a public trust to help fund public health expenses in the event it converts to for-profit status. Its rationale was simple. A company should not be able to use its not-for-profit status--a government granted exemption from taxation--to build market dominance and then convert to for-profit status. In that situation, the not-for-profit status would have acted as a government subsidy, and conversion should not be allowed without some form of assessment for the subsidy. This legislation had bipartisan support and was agreed to by all parties. 
   Throughout consideration of financial modernization legislation, I have steadfastly supported language that will protect this law from possible federal preemption. The conference report accompanying the legislation indicates that this type of law is not of the sort for which federal preemption would come into play. Specifically, the report noted that ``[t]he House receded on its provision specifically addressing a North Carolina Blue Cross-Blue Shield organization, as the State laws governing those types of entities would not be preempted so long as the State laws do not discriminate .....''. Because the North Carolina law places a requirement on Blue Cross/Blue Shield of North Carolina regardless of any possible affiliation, it treats identically all interested parties seeking to affiliate or acquire. A bank that might want to acquire Blue Cross/Blue Shield must comply with the law in the same way as a car dealership, or any other potential acquirer, would. Therefore, it is impossible to argue that the law is in any way discriminatory. 
   The other critical piece of legislation is a recently passed law that prohibits the financing of products like credit insurance in home mortgages. In recent years, including credit insurance costs in the mortgage was a favorite tactic of some predatory institutions--a tactic that ultimately cost consumers thousands of dollars. North Carolina is a leader in making sure its residents are protected from predatory lending and financing practice, predominant over what may be weaker federal standards or laws.  
   The State of North Carolina enacted this law on July 22, 1999. The law, among other things, regulates mortgage financing and what non-housing products may be included. For example, it bars the lump sum financing of credit insurance premiums in consumer home loans. The law 
   was intended to regulate mortgages and to prevent a potentially misleading form of home lending. It does not prevent credit insurance from being provided for home loans on a monthly basis, but merely cuts off financing the premiums up-front since the state General Assembly determined that such financing is fundamentally unfair. Congress does not intend to preempt this law in the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act. 
   I believe that this North Carolina law regulates mortgage financing and does not target the ability of an insured depository to sell insurance products. The focus of my state's legislature was on mortgages and efforts to shoehorn other products into the cost of the mortgage. The legislature would have acted the same way if mortgage lenders had been attempting to include lump sum financing of moving expenses or a new TV. However, if it were determined that the law concerns insurance sales activities, this Act still would not preempt the North Carolina provision. At most, the North Carolina law regulates how credit insurance is sold--the prohibition on financing credit insurance premiums cuts off one avenue of sale while leaving all other avenues open. As Section 104(d)(2) of the Act states, such laws are not preempted unless they ``prevent or significantly interfere with the activities of depository institutions or their affiliates.'' The North Carolina law does neither. Banks may still sell credit insurance in connection with mortgages, only one sale technique is foreclosed. 
   In addition to the two consumer protection matters I just mentioned, I wanted to say a few words about the privacy provisions in this legislation. A great deal of debate centered on personal financial information and the way banks, securities firms and insurance companies may use that information. Privacy in financial services is an extremely complex issue because what one person may view as an invasion of privacy, another might appreciate as a timely and appropriate offering of a much-needed service. I think it is important to realize that the issue of protecting personal privacy is not limited to the financial services world. In our meetings, we also spoke of privacy of medical information. The news is full of stories of other companies--grocery stores, toy makers, appliance stores, telephone companies and others--that are creating massive databases of customer information to be used for marketing products and services. 
   In this legislation, we have given customers the opportunity to decide whether or not they want to let their financial institution share their personal information with a third party. We require financial institutions to have a privacy policy--and we require that this policy is explained to all the institution's customers. We also included an important provision that makes it a Federal crime--punishable by up to 5 years in prison--to obtain customer information through fraudulent or deceptive means. I myself would have supported even more privacy protection. I am confident that in the next few years, we will be forced to deal with this problem more comprehensively. 
   Finally, I would like to say a few things about the Community Reinvestment Act. I struggled long and hard with the CRA provisions included in this law, because CRA is so important to North Carolina and to me personally. I wanted to be able to support this bill, but I would have refused to do so if I believed that CRA was undermined. I have seen first hand the amazing benefits--to banks and to consumers--that have resulted from CRA. 
   North Carolina banks represent some of the biggest and best CRA success stories, and I know from talking to bankers that they work well with community groups to make sure all neighborhoods are served. I spoke with several North Carolina community group leaders about the compromise we worked out, and while I know it wasn't their ideal, I believe that they recognize how much effort went into protecting CRA. Most importantly, I want to make sure that everyone knows that before a bank can even benefit from the new powers under this legislation, it must have at least a ``satisfactory'' CRA record. And, if it doesn't maintain at least a ``satisfactory'' rating, that bank can't buy any other financial firm until it gets its rating back up. What this means for CRA, and for those who actively support its goals, is that the commitments banks make to serving their communities will continue to be of paramount importance to their daily business. 
   However, I do worry about some of the reporting burdens being imposed on CRA groups by this measure. In the last few days, these reporting requirements have been the subject of numerous talks between committee members and the Treasury Department. Because these requirements are a new idea--the provision was added to S. 900 during floor debate--we have been careful to make sure that the language is clear that the provision will not impose undue burdens on community groups. I fear that unless provisions of this bill are narrowly interpreted, they could provoke a kind of regulatory witch hunt. But I am confident that the spirit of this bill is to diminish regulatory burdens and that all provisions in this law must be interpreted in that light. 
   And so we find ourselves at a truly historic moment. We are about to pass legislation that will modernize our nation's financial laws, increase competition, increase options for consumers, decrease costs, protect personal financial information and ensure the continued application of the Community Reinvestment Act. We have a good bill here, and I strongly support it. 
   To elaborate, this is a bill that has been long overdue. There are those who have been toiling in the vineyards with respect to this bill for a very long time. 
   Financial services modernization is well recognized throughout the Senate as something that is desperately needed. If done the right way, which I believe this bill accomplished, it is helpful to consumers. It will provide a more competitive market, greater competition, and one-stop shopping for consumers of financial services. It will also help provide a coherent legal framework for the operation of the financial services industry in this country. 
   A lot of the things we are doing officially and legally through this bill have been done through the back door for years because of the fact that the financial services industry has changed so much in this country over the last 20 to 30 years. The one position we, on my side, felt most strongly about was, while we believed in financial services modernization and supported it--and I wholeheartedly held that belief--it was critical that we be able to maintain the provisions of the Community Reinvestment Act, or CRA, because CRA has done so much good in this country. It has done so much good in my home State of North Carolina to help revitalize chronically economically disadvantaged areas, turned neighborhoods around that were crime infested. It has been an extraordinarily positive thing, something the banks in my State of North Carolina strongly support, always have supported, and continue to support. 
   The one other issue is that of privacy. We made some positive steps with respect to privacy. Since essentially there was very little regulation of people's personal privacy in existing law, we made a positive step in that direction. But there is probably still additional work to do in that area. 
   Let me talk, again, about the Community Reinvestment Act, which is the foundation for us being able to get a bill. The Community Reinvestment Act has had such an extraordinarily positive impact on areas of our country that desperately needed financial support. The bedrock principle in our negotiations on this legislation was that no bank should be allowed to take advantage of the expanded services available under this bill unless they had a satisfactory CRA rating. As a result of much discussion and negotiation between the parties involved in this bill, we have been able to accomplish that. I believe we have done what needed to be done to maintain the fundamental principle of CRA. 
   In addition, we have been able to provide that no bank can acquire or merge with another institution unless it has at least a satisfactory CRA rating. We worked very hard to make sure that  principle remained in place. After much discussion and negotiation, after the bill passed the Senate over the objection of a number of us because we believed it weakened CRA, in the conference committee and in the discussions we were able to get this principle reinstated. We have done the most fundamental thing that had to be done in order to get a bill, which is to make sure CRA was in place, that it remained vibrant and strong, and that no bank could take advantage of the provisions of these expanded services available under this bill unless they had a satisfactory CRA rating. 
   I believe in CRA. I think it is an extraordinarily positive thing for the country. The banks in my State believe in it. They have done a wonderful job complying with the provisions of CRA. We have been able, through hard work and negotiation, to maintain those critical provisions of CRA in this bill. 
   This bill also contains some positive steps in the area of privacy. We had, as I indicated earlier, very little protection for people's personal financial records in banking and financial institutions prior to the enactment of this bill. Assuming we are able to pass this conference report today, there will be some positive steps in that direction. The reality is, though, there are a number of us, myself included, who believe we need to go further, that there is more that needs to be done to protect people's privacy. 
   Folks have a fundamental right to know what is happening with their personal financial information and to know it is not being used in inappropriate ways. 
   This bill takes a positive step in that direction. I think for that reason it makes sense to support the bill. However, I believe there is more work that needs to be done in this area. Many of us on our side, including the ranking member, Senator SARBANES, believe there is more to be done in this area. 
   Financial modernization, as contained in this bill, will also help ensure continued economic growth in this country. The reason for that is that now our banks, our financial institutions in this country, will be able to compete in the global marketplace because our financial institutions have operated for many years now under rules that were antiquated, which in this environment and marketplace made no sense, and with which foreign competitors, who also do business in the United States, didn't have to comply. With continued prosperity and growth so important in our country, it was important that we be able to have modernization in the financial services industry. This bill accomplishes that. 
   It will be good, as I indicated, not only for domestic competition, to allow banks to compete with one another and, as a result, lower costs for consumers, but it also allows our banks to compete internationally, which is critically important. 
   Finally, I thank those who worked so long and hard on this bill. There are many who worked long and tirelessly on this bill: First, Senator SARBANES, our ranking member, who has been one of my mentors in my 10 months here in the Senate, who is a remarkable leader; he has shown remarkable leadership and guidance on this bill. Also, Senator SARBANES' extraordinary staff, Steve Harris and Marty Gruenberg, who are both wonderful, have worked with us throughout this process. This could not have been done without their work and guidance. Also, my friends, Senator DODD, Senator SCHUMER, and Senator REID, who, along with Senator SARBANES, were in that small room with me late into the evening negotiating the provisions of the CRA, which eventually were contained in this legislation and without which there would be no bill. They all worked tirelessly--Senators DODD, SCHUMER, REID, and SARBANES--late into the evening, and we were able, finally, to reach a reasonable compromise. But it could not have been done without the leadership of all of those Senators. 
   Senators SHELBY and BRYAN worked very hard on the issue of privacy. Philosophically, and in my heart, I am with them on that issue. I think we have made positive steps in the area of privacy. Senators SHELBY and BRYAN are fundamentally right that the American people deserve and believe they deserve the right to have their personal financial information protected. They showed great leadership in that area. Senators JOHNSON, KERREY, and BAYH, throughout this process, have worked with us very long and hard, and without their support this legislation would not have been possible. 
   Finally, I mention our chairman, Senator GRAMM, beside whom I had occasion to sit for many hours on that Thursday night and Friday morning when we were able to finally reach agreement on this bill. Without his hard work and leadership and willingness to compromise and negotiate, ultimately, this bill would not exist. The majority leader is right in that respect. So I applaud him for his work on this bill, and I applaud him particularly for his willingness to compromise, to negotiate, and to have a back-and-forth discussion with those of us who had somewhat different views on issues such as CRA privacy. 
   Finally, to Chairmen LEACH and BLILEY and ranking members 
   LAFALCE and DINGELL, who did great work throughout this process, including that late-evening meeting that went to 2:30 or 3 o'clock in the morning; and Secretary Summers and members of the Treasury Department who were in that room working tirelessly with us, particularly to iron out some of the details associated with the compromises that were reached that night. 
   I do believe this is a historic piece of legislation. I think it is a piece of legislation that benefits consumers; it will increase competition in this country; it will lower prices. I believe it will allow for one-stop shopping for folks who want to go to one place and have all their financial services provided, and it makes positive steps in the area of privacy, although there is still work left to be done. 
   Also, most fundamentally, it protects the critical principles of the Community Reinvestment Act, which has been such a positive law in this country and has had such an extraordinarily positive impact on my home State. I have seen neighborhoods that have literally been turned around by CRA, the Community Reinvestment Act. Because of the work and negotiation that went into this legislation, I believe we have satisfied the fundamental principles of CRA. 
   Mr. President, I urge colleagues to support and vote for this conference report. It is the result of a lot of hard work by a lot of people and a lot of compromises. 
   With that, I yield the floor.

   Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, I rise to talk about privacy and about how we can regain some control over our personal information. Privacy is an increasing concern for all Americans. And the public rightly believes that their control over some of their most personal information is being slowly but surely eroded. 
   Today I introduce legislation that would help end that erosion. The ``Telephone Call Privacy Act of 1999,'' would prevent telecommunications companies from using an individual's personal phone call records without their consent, in order to sell that individual products or services. 
   Most Americans would be stunned to learn that the law does not protect them from having their phone records sold to third parties. Imagine getting a call one night--during dinner--and having a telemarketer try to sell you membership in a travel club because your phone calling patterns show frequent calls overseas. My legislation would prevent this from occurring without the individual's permission. 
   Mr. President, no one denies that the rapid development of modern technology has been beneficial. New and improved technologies have enabled us to obtain information more quickly and easily than ever before. Students can participate in classes that are being taught in other states, or even other countries. Current events can be broadcast around the world as they happen. And companies have streamlined their processes for providing goods and services. 
   But these remarkable developments can have a startling downside. They have made it easier to track personal information such as medical and financial records, and buying habits. And in turn, our ability to keep our personal information private is being eroded. I have to say there are times when it feels like companies know more about me than I know myself. 
   The list of ways our privacy is being eroded is growing longer and longer. And sadly telephone call privacy got added to the list this August when the 10th Circuit struck down FCC regulations aimed at protecting privacy and implementing congressional intent. 
   The decision was the result of a suit filed by U.S. West against the FCC arguing that its regulations restrict the ability of carriers to engage in commercial speech with customers. In August, the Tenth Circuit issued its decision in the case and agreed with U.S. West. The court stated that ``privacy is not an absolute good because it imposes real costs on society.'' 
   I believe the court was terribly wrong. Individuals have a reasonable expectation that their calling habits are not being shared with third parties without their knowledge or permission. And when I weigh the right of people to control who has access to their personal information against the ability of companies to use only one of many marketing methods, there is no question that the right of people to privacy is overriding. Surely people have a right to control some of their most private information. And surely they have the right to prevent harassing and unwanted solicitations. I for one cannot believe that expanding the variety of marketing techniques at a company's disposal is more important than a person's privacy right. 
   Mr. President, let me describe how my legislation would address the problem. Current law defines information about who we call, how often, and how long we talk to them as ``customer proprietary network information,'' or ``CPNI.'' It is possible for telephone companies to track an individual's CPNI and use it to market various products and services to that person. 
   My legislation requires that consumers be notified about potential disclosures of their private calling information and allows them to have some measure of control over how their information can be used. Specifically, my bill would do two things. 
   First, if a telecommunications carrier wishes to use CPNI in order to market its own products or services to them, it must provide each customer with a clear and conspicuous notice stating the type of calling information that may be used and the purpose for which it will be used. The customer may contact the carrier to deny permission to use their information within 15 days of the notice. If the customer does not contact the carrier in that time, the carrier can use the customer's CPNI to market its products and services to that customer. In other words, customers are provided with a limited opportunity to ``opt-out'' of the sharing of their information under these circumstances. 
   The second part of my bill addresses situations where a carrier wishes to share a customer's CPNI with a third party, such as a telemarketer. In these situations, in addition to providing the customer with notice, the carrier must also receive prior written approval from the customer. My bill clearly spells out that customers must affirmatively ``opt-in'' before a carrier can sell calling information to any third party. 
   The ``Telephone Call Privacy Act'' also allows for some reasonable and common sense exceptions. If a telecommunications carrier uses a customer's CPNI to provide the customer with the very services the carrier used to obtain the calling information, or if law enforcement or the courts require CPNI for certain reasons, the carrier does not need to provide the customer with notice and the opportunity to opt-out or opt-in. 
   Mr. President, consumers are very worried about how their personal information is being used. In 1994, a Harris Survey assessed Americans' views about privacy. It found that eighty-two percent of people surveyed are concerned about threats to their personal  privacy. And more specifically, more than half the people surveyed also stated they would be concerned if an interactive service engaged in ``subscriber profiling'' or using an individual's purchasing patterns to determine what types of goods and services to market to them. The survey also showed that people are less concerned about subscriber profiling if they are provided with notice that a profile would be created and how it would be used, and also if they are given access to the information in the profile. 
   Something must be done to empower consumers to prevent their private calling information from being used without their consent. The Telephone Call Privacy Act is an important step towards this goal. I believe the principles set forth in my legislation are a reasonable way to protect privacy and do not unduly burden the ability of businesses to market their products and services.

   Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, on the Africa-Caribbean trade bill, let me say first I believe in free trade. This country and my State of North Carolina are part of a global economy. To put our heads in the sand and pretend that is not true is completely unproductive and accomplishes nothing. 
   My concern is that the bills we are addressing this week, the African-Caribbean trade bills, put us in a position of playing with fire. The Senate version of those bills is marginally acceptable but they are significantly different, from my perspective, than the House version of those bills. The Senate version specifically contains provisions for what is called yarn forward and fabric forward, which I will talk about in a few minutes. But both bills are dramatically deficient in one respect; that is, they make it almost impossible, in my judgment, to enforce provisions against transshipment. 
   Transshipment, as my colleagues know, means a country such as China can ship goods to Africa that they otherwise could not ship directly to the United States because of quotas, have a button sewn onto a garment or a piece of apparel, and then have it shipped to the United States and otherwise circumvent existing tariffs and quota requirements. The problem is the enforcement mechanisms against transshipment. In the House bill, in my judgment, they are virtually nonexistent. In the Senate bill, while somewhat better, still we rely heavily on African countries to develop and enforce rules against transshipment. That is simply not a bet worth taking. Unfortunately, transshipment has the potential of putting an enormous number of folks out of work in North Carolina and having a dramatic impact on the textile and apparel industry in my State of North Carolina. 
   The second problem with these bills is the issue of yarn and fabric forward. The Senate bill provides for yarn and fabric forward, which essentially means African countries operating under the Senate bill, if it were passed, would be required to use American yarn, American fabric, which theoretically would help protect American manufacturers in those two areas. The problem is those provisions are not in the African trade bill on the House side. Unfortunately, if this bill passes the Senate, once it gets to conference, there would be enormous pressure to drop out the fabric forward and yarn forward provisions. Without those provisions, the textile and apparel industry in the United States and in my State of North Carolina would be dramatically affected. 
   I said when I began that I believe in free trade, and I do believe in free trade. But I think there are certain fundamental principles with which every free trade agreement should comply. 
   First, the agreements must be negotiated and must be multilateral. The countries with which we are entering  into these agreements have to give something up. As I will discuss in a few minutes, that is not true with respect to this bill. 
   All the trade laws have to be fair and enforceable. As I indicated a few minutes ago, there is at least one major area, transshipment, that in my judgment is not enforceable in this bill. 
   Third, the trade bill must have adequate labor and environmental protections overseas. 
   That is common sense. If our businesses and workers in this country are going to compete, as they should, with businesses and workers overseas, these bills must have adequate labor and environmental protections. 
   Finally, the trade bills must have tangible and provable benefits for U.S. companies and U.S. workers. 
   Those four criteria must be present for a free trade bill to make sense for our country and for my State of North Carolina. 
   I am going to talk about some of these principles and how they apply to this specific bill. 
   First, I just mentioned tangible benefits for U.S. workers. Let me tell you a little bit about what is happening with textile and apparel industry jobs in this country and specifically in my State of North Carolina. 
   We have 177,000 textile jobs in North Carolina. We have 45,000 apparel jobs, 222,000 jobs in total. Almost a quarter of a million workers in my State of North Carolina are dependent on the textile and apparel industry to put food on the table for their families; a quarter of a million families who are going to be impacted if this bill passes and is signed by the President and becomes law. 
   Let's look at what has happened to folks who have worked in that area in North Carolina over the last several years. In the last 5 years, from 1993 to 1998, North Carolina has lost 62,000 jobs in the area of textile and apparel manufacturing. That is 62,000 families who had a breadwinner working in that industry who lost their jobs. I believe the studies have shown that those folks have had a terrible time finding other employment. The reality is that the people who work in these jobs need these jobs. They are critically important to provide them and their families with a livelihood. Oftentimes, there is nowhere else for them to go. 
   I want my colleagues to recognize that when we do pass the kind of legislation we are talking about in these trade bills, it is not just an economic issue. This has real and human consequences on families in my State of North Carolina. 
   We have lost during that same 5-year period in the textile apparel industry almost 300,000 jobs nationally, which means 300,000 families in this country have lost their source of income during that same 5-year period. 
   What has happened during the 10-year period from 1989 to 1999? In North Carolina, we have gone from 220,000 to 177,000 textile jobs, almost 43,000 jobs lost, a 20-percent drop in 10 years. We have gone from 83,000 to 45,000 in the apparel industry, which means they have almost been cut in half; half the people in North Carolina who were dependent on the apparel industry to provide income and livelihood for their families have been put out of work; a 45-percent drop, almost half. The reality is, these families have been devastated by the loss of these jobs. 
   The bill we are talking about today, the African-Caribbean trade bill, could very easily have exactly the same impact because it ensures these jobs we are trying to hold on to in the United States are very likely to be exported to the Caribbean and to African countries. 
   The average apparel wage in the United States is $8 an hour. Let's see how that compares with these other countries. In Mexico, the average wage is 85 cents an hour. In the Dominican Republic, it is 69 cents an hour; El Salvador, 59 cents an hour; Guatemala, 65 cents an hour; and Honduras, 43 cents an hour--$8 an hour to, in all these countries, well under $1 an hour that companies will have to pay in wages. It does not take a mathematical wizard to figure out what is going to happen to these jobs and to all these folks in my State who are completely dependent on the textile and apparel industry to provide for their families, many of whom have been working in this industry for many years. 
   On a personal note, I grew up in the textile business. My dad worked in the textile business for 37 years before his retirement 
   from that business. I have seen firsthand, having worked in mills in North Carolina when I was in high school and in college, how heavily folks depend on these jobs. They have nowhere else to go. 
   The bottom line is, it is all they know, and it is all well and good to talk abstractly about retraining, but when you are talking about retraining somebody who does not have a high school education and who has spent the last 30 or 40 years of their life working in a cotton mill, they have no idea what to do and they have no realistic prospect of going to some other field of employment. These people need these jobs. This is a human tragedy that is created oftentimes by these trade bills. I want folks to realize this is real, and it has a real and devastating effect on people's lives in my State of North Carolina and all over this country. 
   Let me talk briefly about the jobs we know have been lost and the plants that have been closed over the last few years in North Carolina. In September of this year, Pluma Inc. closed a plant in Eden, NC, a small community in North Carolina, 500 jobs lost; 500 families lost their breadwinner. The company of Jasper closed a plant in Whiteville, NC, in September of this year; 191 jobs lost. Whiteville Apparel in Whiteville, NC, in eastern North Carolina, closed a plant in August of this year; 396 jobs lost. Stonecutter Mills in Rutherford and Polk in western North Carolina closed a plant in June of this year; 800 jobs lost. Dyersburg, in Hamilton, NC, closed a plant in May of this year; 422 jobs lost. Unifi in Raeford and Sanford closed a plant in March of this year; 257 jobs lost. Levi Strauss closed a plant in Murphy; 382 jobs lost. Burlington Industries in January of this year closed plants in Cramerton, Forest City, Mooresville, Raeford, Oxford, and Statesville; 2,600 jobs lost. Cone Mills at the end of last year, in December, closed a plant in Salisbury; 625 jobs lost. 
   In a period of less than a year, 6,173 jobs have been lost in my home State of North Carolina. Just imagine what impact the passage of this piece of legislation will have. It will accelerate those numbers. It will not retard them. It will accelerate them, so more and more workers who have spent their lives working in textiles will have nowhere to go, no way to feed their families, and their families are just out of luck. 
   I want to read from a news story that appeared in the Arizona Republic. It appeared on October 23 of this year--just recently. It is entitled ``Textile Industry Unravels Workers Idled By Cheap Labor.'' It does a terrific job of telling the story of what is happening to workers and families all over North Carolina who are being impacted by these trade bills:  
   It was the only work she'd ever done, the only work she'd ever wanted to do. And a contented Lorie Coleman spent a decade and a half inspecting stitch lines, examining cloth and making sure everything that came out of the Ithaca Industries textile mill here met her ``high standards''--never mind the company's. A $6-an-hour job it may have been, but it was hers. 
   Then it was gone. 
   ``To think you could work somewhere,'' Coleman ..... said recently, her voice still tinged with disbelief .....'' and the next thing you know, you're gone, just like that.'' 
   Just like that, a livelihood for the Lorie Colemans of North Carolina and thousands of others in the Piedmont area is disappearing. 
   Since 1995, according to state labor statistics, more than 160 textile and apparel mills have closed in North Carolina, leaving nearly--  
   Listen to this, Mr. President--  
   leaving nearly 30,000 people out of work [since 1995].
   Those losses are reflected throughout the Southeast, which, according to federal figures, lost more than 85,000 such jobs, even as the country was experiencing its fabled economic expansion.  
   During a period of booming prosperity for this Nation's economy, when everyone else is taking advantage of investment in Wall Street, great earnings on Wall Street, companies are doing terrifically well, 85,000 people in the Southeast lost their jobs, 30,000 in my State of North Carolina.  
   To be sure, North Carolina is still the leading state in the leading region for U.S. production of textiles and apparel. Nevertheless, the State is hemorrhaging. 
   Few places in the State have felt the sting of such losses as much as Lorie Coleman's  native Columbus County. Home to nine mills just three years ago, the county now has 3 mills, and two of those are scheduled to close this fall.  
   They will have one mill left.  
   It's a corner of North Carolina that was spared from the worst of Hurricane Floyd's floods last month, but it is bearing the brunt of an industry's decline. After Jasper Textiles and Whiteville Apparel close their gates, the number of textile jobs in this county [Columbus County in eastern North Carolina] will have fallen to 50 from 2,100.  
   In other words, they have gone from 2,100 jobs to 50. There is nowhere for these people to go to work. They have no comparable jobs. There is nowhere else for them to go.  
   Those figures also bear witness to the decline of a distinctly Southern way of life.  
   Lorie Coleman said it best. She spent her life working in this mill and all of a sudden it was gone. Everything she spent her life learning to do has disappeared. 
   There is another fundamental problem with this bill. These bills are unilateral. They are not multilateral. Every Member of the Senate should require, in order to vote for a trade bill, that it be multilateral. 
   What does that mean? First, in the Caribbean, the Dominican Republic charges a 30 to 35 percent tariff on apparel imports. Honduras charges 25 percent. Nicaragua charges 20 percent. We are lowering our tariffs in this bill. Do we have a corresponding lowering of tariffs in those countries? The answer is no. We are unilaterally lowering our tariffs and expecting nothing from the countries that are part of this trade agreement. Their tariffs remain exactly the same. Where is the fairness in this agreement? 
   In Africa, the average tariff on apparel is 27 percent. Exactly the same tariff is charged on home textiles. This simply makes no sense. Why should we as a nation unilaterally lower our tariffs and have our companies in this country subjected to tariffs in the countries we are entering into contracts or agreements with, where they can charge any tariff they want? That is exactly what is happening in this agreement. There is no lowering of trade barriers in Africa, no lowering of trade barriers in the Caribbean. Instead, we have decided unilaterally we will lower trade barriers. 
   I have heard a lot of my colleagues talk about the poverty that reigns in Africa and in the Caribbean. My heart goes out to those people. They are suffering; they are struggling. The fact that they are working for anywhere from 35 to 85 cents an hour bears witness to the terrible lives with which they and their families are confronted. But we, in my State of North Carolina, have an awful lot of people who are struggling to make ends meet, too. We have an awful lot of people and families who have spent their lives going into those mills every day, 5, sometimes 6 days a week, 8 to 10 hours a day, to learn to do a job, to build up seniority, to provide for their families. 
   When we enter into these kind of trade agreements, particularly when we can't enforce provisions against transshipment, where there is a real likelihood that yarn and fabric forward will go out when this bill goes to conference and, as a result, there is a devastating economic impact on North Carolina's textile business and on North Carolina's textile workers, those people lose everything. This is not just an abstract economic proposition we are debating. We are talking about human lives. We are talking about an enormous impact on the families I represent in North Carolina. 
   I want my colleagues, when they come to vote, either on cloture or on the passage of this bill ultimately, if we reach that stage, to understand every single one of them has a dramatic effect on real human beings' lives across this country and in my home State of North Carolina.

   Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, I want to say a word about my friend and colleague, Senator Chafee. Having had the honor and privilege of being his friend for the 10 months I have been here, the thing that struck me most about Senator Chafee was his kind and gentle nature. It was the sort of thing I am afraid we need more of in government in general and particularly in this body. He was a thoughtful leader who showed exactly the kind of leadership we desperately need in our country today. He was also a thoughtful, nonpartisan voice on issues that were not partisan, issues we ought to be able to work together on, issues that are good for America. 
   It is an extraordinary loss for me personally to lose Senator Chafee. He was someone I looked up to and admired in my brief time here. I don't know anyone here who did not love and adore him. I can certainly add my voice to those who will miss him dearly.

   Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, I enter this debate sad that partisan politics has obstructed the effort of many of us to address this problem in a meaningful way. Put simply, I oppose partial-birth abortions. Indeed, I oppose all late-term abortions unless they are necessary to save the life of the mother or to avert grievous damage to the physical health of the mother.  
   I have voted for the Durbin amendment and will vote against the Santorum measure. One, the Durbin proposal, has failed. The other will pass the Senate but accomplish nothing. 
   The Santorum bill suffers from a number of serious flaws. First, it is clearly unconstitutional. The vast majority of federal courts dealing with this issue have held so, and no amount of wishful thinking can alter that fact. Second, even if it were constitutional, it would not stop a single abortion. Let me reiterate that: it would not stop a single abortion. It would simply spur doctors and women to seek other methods to achieve the same goal. 
   Before explaining why the Santorum measure is unconstitutional, let me elaborate on why it is ineffective. Long before the procedure of partial-birth abortion was developed, late-term, postviability abortions were available through alternative methods. Under the Santorum bill, which only prevents one particular procedure, physicians can simply revert to the use of other more dangerous procedures if partial-birth abortion is banned. This bill will not end late-term abortions. It will simply force doctors to fall back on antiquated medical interventions that will further endanger the lives and health of women. Is that really what we want? 
   In addition, 19 recent court rulings have determined that similar proposals are unconstitutional. There is a strong likelihood that this bill, if passed, will be struck down as unconstitutional according to the precedent set by Roe v. Wade. As drafted this legislation is unconstitutionally vague and violates the clear dictates of the Supreme Court. Our objective should not be to pass divisive legislation that has no chance of ever becoming law. 
   And so I support the Durbin amendment. I believe it achieves a rare balance in the debate about abortion. It is constitutional. It limits government interference in a woman's most personal and important decisions. And it provides a framework for dealing with the late-term abortions--including partial birth abortions--that the so many of us struggle to find sense in. 
   I have spoken with women who have had late-term abortions. They struggled mightily with their God and their consciences. They made their decisions with their husbands, their families and their doctors. And they alone confronted the awful moment when hope for a new life collided with terror about the fate of their own life. I can never understand that conflict. But I believe that the Durbin amendment offers a bridge between those women and all of us who try to understand how or why a woman might choose to have a late-term abortion. 
   I simply do not believe that Senators or any government representative has the authority or expertise to determine that a partial-birth or late-term abortion will never be necessary to prevent severe injury to a woman's physical health or a threat to her life. But I do believe that we do have the authority to ask that before a late-term abortion is performed it be determined that the woman's life or physical health are truly at stake. The Durbin amendment would accomplish this goal. It would bar, except in narrow circumstances and under the advice and consent of two physicians, all late-term abortions. 
   On balance, I believe that the difficult question of abortion should be left for a woman to decide in consultation with her family, her physician and her faith. However, once the fetus has reached viability, I believe that we do have a responsibility, and a constitutional ability, to protect the unborn child. I believe that the Durbin amendment was the piece of legislation before us that would have most effectively accomplish that goal. And so I have voted in its favor.

    Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the 21st Century Community Policing Initiative Act. I am proud to be an original co-sponsor of this legislation, introduced by Senators BIDEN and SCHUMER, that I believe is crucial to our efforts to fight crime. 
   This important bill would re-authorize the successful Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS) program through the year 2005. Because of the COPS program, there are over 100,000 more police officers on the beat than there were before this program was implemented in 1994. This represents a nearly 20 percent increase in police presence nationwide. 
   By extending the COPS program, the 21st Century Community Policing Initiative Act will help put up to 50,000 more police on the streets over the next five years. It will also provide $350 million a year in grants to law enforcement agencies to assist them in acquiring new technology to enhance crime fighting efforts. This means better communications systems so cops in different jurisdictions can talk to each other; state of the art investigative tools like DNA analysis; and the means to target crime hot spots. 
   This legislation would also provide $200 million per year in grants for community-wide prosecutors. This aspect of the bill would expand the community policing concept to engage the whole community in preventing and fighting crime. The cops have been so successful in their jobs that the next step is to provide more prosecutors to help get criminals off the streets. 
   Mr. President, one of the best ways to fight crime is to have more well-trained police officers on our streets and in our schools, and to provide them with the latest equipment and technology. The COPS program has helped achieve these goals, and has in turn helped to make our communities safer places for our children, families, and businesses. 
   The COPS program has been a tremendous asset to my state of North Carolina. As of October 20th, the COPS program had provided North Carolina with grants of over $135 million. From Alexander Mills to Zebulon, North Carolina communities have received COPS funding to help law enforcement agencies hire an additional 2,602 police officers to patrol neighborhoods and protect our schools. 
   In August, I met with police officers and sheriffs from across North Carolina to learn more about how the COPS program is helping to keep local communities safe. I heard from law enforcement officers from the larger cities such as Raleigh and Charlotte. I also spoke with officers from smaller, rural areas like North Wilkesboro and Randolph County. The one clear message 
   that I got from all of these officers is that the COPS program is working and should be continued. 
   Mr. President, crime rates in big cities are generally higher than they are in smaller towns. An increased police presence can help deter crime in these urban areas. However, officers I met with from less populated regions of North Carolina emphasized to me that even one more cop can make a world of difference to a community that lacks its own resources to hire more police officers. In these situations, the COPS program can step in and provide these communities with the additional help they need. 
   One of the most interesting and persuasive arguments to renew the COPS program was also one that I heard during these conversations with North Carolina police officers. They told me that when people think of the COPS program, they immediately think of more officers policing the streets. However, one of the most important roles that the COPS program has played is to provide funds for law enforcement agencies to work in partnership with education officials to solve problems of crime in and around schools. 
   Officers are not just placed in the schools to instill discipline. They act as counselors, coaches and mentors for children. And they are reaching out to students by offering safe after-school activities. North Carolina officers told me that these efforts are some of the best kinds of crime prevention measures that we can take. 
   By connecting with at-risk youth, these school-based officers have become trusted adult authority figures that kids will run to in times of trouble, instead of running away from them. 
   Many police chiefs and sheriffs credit community policing and COPS support with dramatic drops in crime rates around the nation. Since the inception of the COPS program, violent crime in North Carolina is down 7% and aggravated assault has fallen by 8%. According to a report issued by the State Bureau of Investigation, the state's murder rate fell 3% from 1997 to 1998. And, the country's crime rate is at its lowest in 25 years. 
   These statistics are encouraging, but now is not the time to eliminate a program that has substantially contributed to declining crime rates. We still have a long way to go to insuring that people are walking crime-free streets and children are attending crime-free schools. 
   Continuation of the COPS program is one significant way that we can continue to make progress towards these goals. 
   Mr. President, during debate on the juvenile crime bill, Senator BIDEN offered an amendment that would have re-authorized the COPS program through 2005. I voted for this amendment which was endorsed by many law enforcement organizations including the National Fraternal Order of Police and the International Association of Chiefs of Police. Unfortunately, the amendment failed by the slimmest of margins (48-50). However, I am confident that upon reconsideration of the question whether it is necessary to renew the COPS program, my colleagues will realize how effective and valuable the program has been, not only to their individual states, but to the nation as a whole. 
   I want to thank Senators BIDEN and SCHUMER for their efforts to re-authorize the COPS program and I urge all of  my colleagues to support the 21st Century Community Policing Initiative Act.

   Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleagues in honoring Senator LEAHY on casting his 10,000th vote in the United States Senate. Given that I have just cast my 328th vote, I am humbled and impressed by the senior Senator from Vermont's accomplishment. This feat is a true measure of Senator LEAHY's dedication to the people of the United States and his commitment to the state of Vermont. 
   Senator LEAHY made a lasting impression on me early in my tenure as he oversaw the Democratic Senators who attended the impeachment depositions. In very difficult circumstances, Senator LEAHY set a tone of fairness and collegiality. His example during the depositions is one that I will always value as I continue my public service. 
   I am truly grateful for and humbled by the service that Senator LEAHY has given to this nation, and I also thank him for his enduring leadership, selflessness and influence in the U.S. Senate. I look forward to his next 10,000 votes.

   Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, our political process is diseased. The virus causing that disease is money. The worst virus of all is what is known as soft money. The people of America, including folks I grew up with in a small town in North Carolina, no longer believe their vote matters. As a result, they do not go to the polls; they do not participate. They have completely disengaged with their Government and the political process. 
   We have to do something in the Senate to bring those people back, to make the people all over this country believe again that this is their Government. We have to make people believe again that their Government up in Washington is not some foreign thing that has nothing to do with them and nothing to do with their lives, 
   but, in fact, they have ownership of this Government; this is their Government. It doesn't belong to the Senators who participate in this body; it belongs to the people, every single one of them. We must make them believe again that when they go to the polls and vote, their vote counts every bit as much as anybody else's vote and that their voice in the process is as loud and clear as anybody else's. 
   The reality is, people have disengaged for a two major reasons. One is the influx of big money. I don't think it is an accident that during the widening of the soft money loophole and the boom of big soft money contributions over the last several years that allows people to write checks for $100,000, $200,000, $500,000, completely unregulated, unmonitored--that during this same period of time voter turnout has steadily declined. 
   The simple reason for that is, average Americans, average North Carolinians, believe their voice is being drowned out by big money. These people, who have good sense, their gut tells them that when somebody else writes a check for $100,000--first of all, most of them can't afford to write a check for $25 for a political candidate, much less $100,000--that there is no way in their life experience they are going to be listened to, that they are going to have the access to their Senator or to their Congressman that the person who writes these big money checks has. It is just that simple. They are not on a first-name basis with their Senator, they are not on a first-name basis with their Congressman, but these people who write $100,000 checks are. 
   We have to do something about that. That problem--that cynicism, the distrust, the belief that Government up in Washington has nothing to do with them--is what keeps them from going to the poll. 
   Unfortunately, this problem of the influence of big money is compounded when they turn on their television sets in October before an election, and what do they see on television? They see hateful negative personal attacks, many of which are funded with big money, soft money, unregulated money contributions. These negative political ads are the second major reason people are not engaged in the political process. It is the reason that they don't vote and that they are cynical about government and cynical about politics. It is also the reason they don't encourage their kids to get involved in government. It is the reason they themselves don't participate, because they believe in their hearts that the process has been corrupted. The result of that corruption is, they want nothing to do with it. They don't want their family to have anything to do with it. They don't want their kids to have anything to do with it. 
   It used to be that public service was a very noble calling, before this extraordinary influx of big money and these spiteful advertisements we have seen over the last few years. We have to do everything in our power to return power in this Government where it started and where it belongs, which is with average Americans going to the polls. 
   One of my constituents wrote to me. I think he said it very well. I am quoting Jason McNutt. He said:  
   Our democracy is threatened by the amounts that wealthy special interests are spending on politics. Ordinary citizens like myself have very little influence..... The American democracy has been corrupted by big money.  
   He is exactly right. Mr. McNutt is expressing a feeling that, at a gut level, people all over this country have. And that feeling of disenchantment is what we have to address.  
   I heard an extended debate last week between Senator MCCAIN, who has shown great and courageous leadership on this issue, and another Senator. Basically the interchange was, point out to us what Senators have been corrupted. A large part of the debate had to do with questions and answers about which Senators had been corrupted. 
   I have been in the Senate for about 9 months. 
   The men and women I serve with here are far from corrupt. They are hard-working people who do what they think is right and, even when we disagree, I have enormous respect for my colleagues in this body. That respect has done nothing but grow during the time I have been here. 
   The problem with the debate, though, is it is not about what Senators are corrupt. That focus is wrong. That is about us. This debate is not about us. This debate is about the folks who have quit voting. It is about parents who don't want their kids involved in politics, who don't want their kids involved in Government. They have this feeling in their stomach that there is something wrong. They could not articulate to you with great specificity what is wrong, but they know something is wrong. There is no place I would put greater confidence than in the gut understanding of the American people. It is the reason they are not voting anymore and not participating. 
   The single biggest loophole that we have today is soft money. I strongly support comprehensive, across-the-board campaign finance reform, to return power to regular people. But the reality is that what we have a chance of passing in this Congress is a ban on soft money. That doesn't solve the problem, there is no question about that; we will continue to have other problems in other areas. But if we keep putting this off, not addressing the issue and voting it down on a procedural basis, even though a majority of the Senators voted in favor of campaign finance reform, we have not sent the right signal to the American people. We have a responsibility--I believe I have a personal responsibility to the people that I represent all over North Carolina--to say that we are going to do what we can do. We are going to send you a powerful signal that we are starting the process of solving this huge problem. 
   The simplest way to send that signal is to ban soft money--to ban it tomorrow. Let's put a stop to this unregulated flow of huge sums of money that are coming into our political system. This ban alone won't solve the problems facing our political system. Nobody believes it will. But it will send a powerful message across this country that we care, that the people in this Senate care about how average Americans feel about the process. Because if we don't ban soft money, we send the signal that we don't care, that all we care about is ourselves, our own elections, and we don't care about the people out there across this country who are no longer going to the polls. We have to do something about that. They need to hear a loud and powerful message from us. 
   We can address the other issues as we go forward. But, first, we have to make it clear to the people of America that we are willing to do something and that we are focused on them, their concerns, and their worries and not just ourselves and our elections. That is what we need to do, Mr. President. 
   The bottom line is, we ultimately have to return power in this Government to where it started, which is with regular people going to the polls. We have to return democracy to its roots, because that is how this country began. Over the course of the last 200 years--particularly over the course of the last 10 years--that has changed. Folks back home know in their hearts and souls, without seeing it, that these powerful people who write big checks, the big special interests, are having an enormous influence over what happens up here. It bothers them. You know, it ought to bother them, because they are right. We have to say something back to these people who are worried, who aren't voting anymore and don't want their kids involved in Government and politics. I, myself, in my last campaign, made a decision not to accept contributions from PACs and Washington lobbyists, which is nothing but a small step along this road. But we as a body have to send a message, and that message should be loud, clear, and unequivocal. The message is that we are returning power in your democracy to you.

   Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, first, I thank my friend, the Senator from Mississippi, and the Senator from Wisconsin for all their hard work on this very difficult bill. I intend to support this bill. 
   Let me talk briefly about what this Agriculture Appropriations bill does for North Carolina and what it will not be able to do for North Carolina. In North Carolina, we talk about things in terms of before and after Hurricane Floyd, unfortunately. 
   Before Hurricane Floyd, our farmers were struggling, having very difficult times, financially and otherwise. Their crop prices were at the lowest levels they have been in many years. And they needed help; they desperately needed help. One of the things this bill does is provide some of that help in the way of direct market assistance for some of the problems they had before Hurricane Floyd. 
   We have about $328 million in this conference report for North Carolina's tobacco farmers. I have to say, for those around the country who are not familiar with North Carolina's farming operations, an awful lot of our farmers are tobacco farmers. They may farm a lot of other crops, but tobacco is often the staple that allows them to farm those other crops. This money was desperately needed. And they needed it now. They needed it even before Hurricane Floyd hit. Having visited with our farmers, including our tobacco farmers, all over the State of North Carolina, we are very pleased and very proud that we were able to get them the assistance which they deserved and which they needed. 
   Sadly, though, I have to also talk about the situation after Floyd. This bill provides $1.2 billion for disaster relief. I have to say, I think this is way short of 
   what we are going to need in North Carolina. We have a real emergency, I think by anybody's standards, in the agricultural farming community in North Carolina as a result of Hurricane Floyd. 
   I have been all over North Carolina and have spent a lot of time in eastern North Carolina, visiting our farms that have been devastated by Hurricane Floyd. The reality is, this is a loss from which it is going to take many years to recover. 
   Of this $1.2 billion, some reasonably sized chunk of that money will go to farmers in North Carolina. It will not ultimately be enough. But it is critically important that we get some of that money to them, and get it to them quickly. I urge the Secretary of Agriculture to do as much as he can to get as much of this money as is possible disbursed in the immediate future because these farmers need help. They already needed help before Hurricane Floyd. And they need help now more than ever. They need it immediately. 
   What this photograph I have represents is what I saw all over eastern North Carolina as a result of Hurricane Floyd and in the wake of Hurricane Floyd. We can see almost the entire farm--except for the farmhouse--is under water. This property, which has been involved in farming for many years, is now under water. And the crop losses have been completely devastating.  
   This scene is repeated over and over and over, all over eastern North Carolina. We are told the best estimates are, at this point, that there is somewhere between $800 million and $1 billion in agricultural losses in North Carolina. Obviously, the money in this bill is not going to be adequate since it is for the entire country. It is not going to be adequate to deal with the loss in North Carolina alone which approaches $1 billion. We are going to have to do more. 
   I want the people of North Carolina, and particularly our farmers in North Carolina, to know that we fully recognize they need help. They need help quickly. They do not need loans. They were already up to their necks in debt and up to their necks in loans before the hurricane hit. They need help. They need direct disaster relief, and they need it immediately. 
   I point out, both for my farmers in North Carolina and to my colleagues, that the money that was recently put in the VA-HUD conference report, the approximately $2.48 billion for FEMA, will not help with the farming problem in North Carolina because that money is not designated and indeed cannot be used specifically for agriculture. 
   We are going to have to have some direct appropriation through some vehicle in this Congress--this session--to help our farmers because if we do not they are going out of business. They are the heart and soul of North Carolina and to our economy in North Carolina, and particularly to our rural economy in North Carolina. We have to be there for them. They have been there for us. We have to step to the plate and provide them with the support they need. 
   Finally, I express my disappointment with the lack of any dairy legislation in this conference report. 
   I supported dairy legislation. I continue to support it. We recognize the plight of dairy farmers in North Carolina. We understand the difficulties and problems they have. We will continue to search and aggressively pursue ways to solve the problems with which they are confronted. 
   Again, I thank the distinguished managers of this measure. 
   I yield the floor. 
   Mr. COCHRAN addressed the Chair.

    Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, on September 14, Hurricane Floyd began making its way up the eastern coast, leaving in its path unprecedented destruction. The hurricane made landfall  at the mouth of the Cape Fear River in North Carolina on September 16 and brought with it strong winds and torrential downpours. To date, Hurricane Floyd is responsible for 65 deaths, 45 in North Carolina alone. One week after Hurricane Floyd made landfall, flood waters just beginning to recede and North Carolinians are now starting the grim task of starting over.

   Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, I am here to talk about the terrible devastation that has occurred in my State of North Carolina, which most of my colleagues, I know, are aware of, and to  give them an update on a report I gave last week. 
   The people of North Carolina are suffering in a way they have never suffered before. This is absolutely the worst disaster that has ever hit the State of North Carolina. There has been tragedy, and there have been acts of heroism. It has been an extraordinarily difficult situation, particularly for the people of eastern North Carolina. Thus far, we have 37 confirmed deaths as a result of the hurricane. We have four additional North Carolinians at this point presumed dead. We expect, as the waters recede, as FEMA officials and other local folks are able to get into houses that have been covered by water, that we will find additional North Carolinians who have lost their lives as a result of this flood. Let me give one example. 
   We have one entire family that was wiped out by this flood--six members of the family. This happened in Pinetops, NC, which is one of the worst hit areas of eastern North Carolina. Ben and Vivian Mayo, Keisha Mayo, and Cabrina and Destiny Flowers were all killed as they tried to escape in a small boat but the boat capsized. Yesterday, rescue team members who were working in the area discovered another member of the family, Teshika, who was 50 feet from her grandparents' home at the time of her death. She was 5 years old. That is six members of this family who died in the course of this hurricane. This is a terrible tragedy. I ask all of my colleagues and the American people as a whole to please give their thoughts and prayers to these families as they go through an extraordinarily difficult time. 
   We had business losses that we have never had in the history of North Carolina. An example is Jamie Milliken's family who operated an electric supply company in Brunswick County. As a result of the flood, they have lost $2 million worth of merchandise. They had no flood insurance. Some of the hardest hit businesspeople in eastern North Carolina are the farmers. 
   The bottom line is--and I will talk in a little more detail about this in a few minutes--there are many farmers in eastern North Carolina who will be put out of business. They were already struggling, already having a very difficult time making ends meet. This has been a year where they have been hit and hit again: Hit by drought, hit by low crop prices, hit by low livestock prices. And then, when they are teetering on the edge, they get the final nail in the coffin, which is the effect of this hurricane on their businesses and on their farms. The effect has been devastating. 
   We have also had enormous problems with housing and homelessness. The truth is, we have people who are desperate. For example, we got a call in my office from a mother whose daughter is stranded in New Hanover County, where Wilmington is located. She lost everything: Her home, her car, all of her possessions, and her job. Her mother says her daughter has absolutely no idea how she will go about rebuilding her life and she can't stop crying. Every time she calls her, she is crying. She has no idea how she will deal with the situation. 
   We have about 10,000 people in eastern North Carolina who still remain in shelters, who cannot get to their homes because of the floodwaters, and they have nowhere to go except the shelters. Mr. President, 50,000 homes have been affected by this hurricane. We expect that number actually to go up as we have more time to go in and see what damage has been caused. 
   I might add, I spoke with the Director of FEMA, James Lee Witt, a bit ago. He pointed out to me something that the people in North Carolina have already thought about. When the floodwaters recede, because the water has been contaminated by a variety of things, including wastewater treatment plants being flooded, including dead livestock, including any of a variety of things, the 
   water is contaminated that has gone into people's homes. When that water recedes, folks are going to want to go home. They have been out of their homes for a long time now, living in shelters. They will want to go home. The problem is, their houses will be contaminated. They will have enormous health threats as a result of the contamination caused by the floodwaters. We will be confronted with a situation of trying to decontaminate the houses, and in some cases that may be impossible. It may be required that the houses simply be torn down and rebuilt. 
   I might add, many of these people whose houses have been flooded had no flood insurance. To be fair to them, they had no reason to have flood insurance. They didn't live in a floodplain. They didn't live in an area that had ever been flooded. They had no reason to believe their homes would ever be flooded. They are the victims of this hurricane. 
   Water supplies. We have thousands of people in eastern North Carolina who have no clean water. Many people who had wells as the source of their drinking water, the water they use on their farm, the water they use to bathe--the wells are gone. 
   In Greenville, which is probably the largest city in eastern North Carolina, they are facing an entire shutdown of their water supply due to a break in the water main. If this occurs, every restaurant, every business, will have to close and it will affect every resident in the area. 
   We have about 120 million gallons of hog waste caused by broken and flooded lagoons spilling into floodwaters. Water is flowing directly from our sewage systems into these floodwaters, which are contaminating homes, contaminating businesses, contaminating farms. 
   We also have a problem with our roads. We have more than 900 roads that have been washed out where floods have been recorded. One example of this is Interstate 95. You can just see the extent to which Interstate 95 has been flooded. It is totally impassable. We still have, I might add, many sections of Interstate 95 and Interstate 40 which are still impassable. We have 10 bridges that have been destroyed during the course of this. 
   I mentioned earlier our farms and our agriculture in eastern North Carolina. These folks have been devastated. They have been through extraordinarily difficult times. Now the bottom line is their farms are underwater. 
   Just some examples of the crop losses we expect to be incurred: Cotton, we expect to lose 80 percent of the cotton crop in North Carolina; soybeans, 75 to 80 percent; peanuts, 75 to 80 percent; sweet potatoes, to date, about 25 percent of that crop has been harvested. We expect to lose anywhere from 75 to 80 percent and possibly greater of the sweet potato crop. Mr. President, 50 percent of the tobacco crop, which we all know is an enormously important economic crop in North Carolina, has been lost. 
   Livestock: I just finished meeting a few minutes ago with livestock farmers, hog farmers from eastern North Carolina, and they have been totally devastated. They have virtually no insurance. A lot of these farms have lost many thousands of dollars. In fact, the average amount of equipment that is located on these farms is worth $500,000. That equipment is not insured and it has been largely destroyed because the people had to leave their farms so quickly when the water started to rise. There have been more than 100,000 hogs that have been drowned so far; about 3 million poultry. Widespread starvation is facing many of the animals that still are in eastern North Carolina because they are cut off from feed sites and they are cut off from rescue efforts. 
   The fishing industry has suffered a great deal so far, and they are going to continue to suffer. Many fishermen have lost their boats, and we expect many of the environmental results of this hurricane's devastation in eastern North Carolina to cause problems with our fishing reserves for many years to come. 
   Finally, debris and contaminated water has done enormous damage to the soil of eastern North Carolina, of which our farmers are so proud and have relied upon for so long. 
   I can show just a couple of other examples of the flooding that exists in eastern North Carolina. Many folks have seen these photographs from some of the television stories. But here is an example of the level of the flooding in a rural area in eastern North Carolina. These are people who never had water on their property. They never had any notion they had to be worried about that. 
   Here is an example of what I saw when I traveled this past weekend over  eastern North Carolina. What is shown in this photograph I saw all over eastern North Carolina. You can see that it is not just flooding. The flooding is up to the roofs of these houses and it is extensive and you see it over and over and over. It is all over the areas of eastern North Carolina. Can you imagine the folks who spent their lives living in these homes and the devastation this has created for them? Everything they own and spent their lives putting together is in these homes that have been flooded. 
   Finally, I made mention of the farming operations. Here is a farm in eastern North Carolina. Everything we see underwater in these sections is all farmland; all had crops on them, all a total loss, 100 percent total loss. This scene is repeated over and over. I spent hours in a helicopter going over eastern North Carolina and landing in various places. I can't tell you the human tragedy associated with this for people who have spent their lives here. For these folks who farm this land and who live in eastern North Carolina, this is not just a place they live. This is a way of life for them, and they have now lost it. This is something 
   that is going to be difficult, if not impossible, for the people of eastern North Carolina to ever recover from. 
   Having said all of this, there are a number of people we need to thank because the reality is there have been and there will continue to be acts of heroism as a result of this catastrophe in eastern North Carolina. 
   First, FEMA; FEMA has done an extraordinary job so far. I expect them to continue to do an extraordinary job. Their Director, James Lee Witt, has been on top of this problem. He has been in regular contact with all the people who are involved, including myself and Governor Hunt. The American Red Cross has been omnipresent in eastern North Carolina and will continue to be so. They have done a wonderful job. 
   The Salvation Army and the Marine Corps have done a wonderful job. The Army, the troops who are located in eastern North Carolina, the Coast Guard, the Navy, the National Guard have all worked extraordinarily hard to deal with this problem. 
   I might add, our mayors and our State and local officials have done a wonderful job. I include in that group our Governor, Jim Hunt, who has been on top of this situation from the very beginning. I am proud of the job he has done. 
   I am also proud of the job that has been done by many of the folks in eastern North Carolina. The bottom line is North Carolina has been devastated in a way that we have never been devastated before. We have people who are struggling, who are confronting situations they never in their lifetimes thought they would have to confront. People's lives have been lost, people's futures have been lost, and their businesses have been lost. There are farmers who spent their lives farming this land who will have a very difficult time getting back to the place where they can farm their land again. 
   What we ask is simply for the prayers and support of my colleagues in the Senate and of the American people because the reality is we are in a difficult situation. We need their help. We know the American people will respond in the way they always have to this kind of tragedy, which is to support us.

   I would add to that, I say to Senator BOND, that Senator HELMS is working very hard, the senior Senator from North Carolina, on this problem. He and I have talked about it on a couple of occasions already. We will continue to talk about it. He is working very hard on this problem. So is our Governor. 
   We appreciate very much your help and support. I appreciate your thoughts and prayers. This is one of those times where we need all the help and support we can get, I can promise you. 
   I yield the floor.

    Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, I rise to honor the life of a remarkable North Carolinian. Judge Sam Ervin III died last Saturday, September 18, 1999 at the age of 73. His passing has left a void--his family and friends have lost a wonderful, caring man, North Carolina has lost one of its finest citizens, and our nation has lost an honorable and respected jurist. 
   Judge Ervin devoted his life to public service. Born March 2, 1926 in Morganton, North Carolina to the late Senator Sam Ervin, Jr. and Margaret Bruce Ervin, Judge Ervin studied at Davidson College. He interrupted his undergraduate education for two years to serve in the U.S. Army during World War II. After attending Harvard Law School, he returned to the Army, attaining the rank of colonel while serving in the Judge Advocate General's Corps. In 1952, Judge Ervin returned to practice law in Morganton, where he would remain for the better part of the rest of his life. Judge Ervin served in the North Carolina General Assembly between 1965 and 1967, when Governor Dan Moore appointed Judge Ervin to the North Carolina Superior Court bench. 
   Judge Ervin was considered among the ablest Superior Court Judges of his time. Lawyers trusted that Judge Ervin would afford all litigants a full and impartial hearing and would ground his decision in the law. He was often selected by the Chief Justice of the North Carolina Supreme Court to preside over controversial trials from which local judges recused themselves.  
   After thirteen years as a trial judge, Judge Ervin was sworn in on May 25, 1980 as a judge on the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals of the United States. When he was elevated to the chief judgeship of the Fourth Circuit in 1989, he became only the second North Carolinian to occupy this important position. Supreme Court Justice Lewis Powell, Jr. once described Judge Ervin as ``the very model of what a judge, especially the presiding judge of a great court, should be.'' 
   Judge Ervin left his mark in hundreds of decisions. He always was fair and principled. He approached cases with a deep understanding of the law, but never forgetting the common sense he developed growing up in Morganton. Just last year, he participated in two important decisions affecting elections in North Carolina. In the middle of the election year, the district court issued an opinion striking down North Carolina's campaign finance statute. Judge Ervin issued a stay on the decision until the election season ended to prevent the election from devolving into confusion. Similarly, he participated in a decision to keep the primary election on May 5, 1998 for all offices except for the U.S. House, which was subject to a redistricting lawsuit, to minimize disruption for the other candidates and the electorate. 
   Judge Ervin had the courage to stand up for his beliefs, which he always did in his typical gracious manner. In February 1997, as a witness in a congressional hearing about proposed legislation to reduce the number of judgeships on the Fourth Circuit, he politely took issue with the Chairman of the hearing. He believed that the court's ability to render swift and certain justice would be enhanced by the filling of two long vacant positions, not by eliminating them. He stated that the degree of delegation by circuit court judges was greater than ideal and that he would like to be able to devote greater personal attention to the matters that came before him. 
   Because he was such a remarkable person and a dedicated jurist, he earned the lifelong admiration of dozens of young people who clerked for him over the years. He also earned the respect of his peers in the legal profession, as well as many honors over the years. Just this year, the North Carolina Bar Association accorded him its Liberty Bell Award for ``strengthening the American system of freedom under law'' and the North Carolina Academy of Trial Lawyers presented him its Outstanding Appellate Judge Award. 
   The Judge cherished his family, which is nothing they do not already know. What he knew about the important, everlasting things in life, he said that he learned from his parents, his wife Elisabeth, his two sons, Jim and Robert, and his two daughters, Betsy and Margaret. I send my heartfelt condolences to Elisabeth and their children. Please know that you are in my prayers. 
   In his commencement speech at Campbell University this past spring, he told the graduates, ``[I]f you seek truth, if you keep faith, and have courage, life will release you from the little things and give you peace of mind and heart.'' Judge Ervin left this world released of the little things with peace of mind and peace of heart because throughout his life, he never stopped searching for truth, he kept faith in God, and he repeatedly demonstrated courage.

   Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, I want to speak for a moment today about the hurricane and report to my colleagues on what we have learned about the damage Hurricane Floyd has done in North Carolina. 
   As most folks know, North Carolina, unfortunately, has borne the brunt of hurricanes over the last few years. I think this is the fifth major hurricane to hit North Carolina since 1996. What we know thus far is that four people have died in traffic-related accidents as a result of the hurricane. 
   First, of course, our thoughts and prayers go to the families of those folks who have lost loved ones. Secondly, we have had enormous flooding. That flooding will continue, and there will be some period of time before that flooding recedes. Wilmington has received over 18 inches of rain in the last approximately 48 hours, and other areas of eastern North Carolina have received enormous amounts of rain during the same period of time. 
   We have also had enormous problems with crop damage and injury and damage to our farms, particularly in eastern North Carolina. These farmers are already struggling and suffering and having a difficult time making ends meet. Now they have received a blow, which may very well be a death blow, to the crops they still have in the fields. As I said, these are people who are already teetering on the edge. Now these farmers and their families must deal with the damage that Hurricane Floyd has caused their farms. 
   We have also had roads washed out in eastern North Carolina. We know we have power outages all over eastern North Carolina, and we have and will continue to have enormous problems with increased erosion as a result of this hurricane hitting the coast of North Carolina. 
   Let me say, first, that I have been in regular contact with Governor Jim Hunt, the Governor of North Carolina, since this hurricane began to approach the southeastern coast of the United States in order to help prepare for what we knew was inevitable--that this would do great damage for our State. In addition, I have been in constant contact with mayors from eastern North Carolina whose counties have been hit the hardest by this hurricane. Yesterday afternoon, I spent some time at the FEMA headquarters with James Lee Witt looking at the FEMA operation--looking at what they were doing to prepare for the onslaught of this hurricane and their preparations for going in after the hurricane and dealing with destruction created by the hurricane. 
   I have to say, first of all, it was an incredibly impressive operation. James Lee Witt has done an extraordinary job of turning FEMA around. They are well prepared and well organized. I strongly suspect they will respond quickly and efficiently to the destruction this particular storm creates. 
   In addition to that, I talked to the Secretary of Transportation, Mr. Slater, about the problems with roads and roads being washed out, keeping in mind that North Carolina has just recently been hit with Hurricane Dennis, which washed out Highway 12 up on the Outer Banks of North Carolina, and now it has been hit again by a larger, more serious hurricane. We are going to have enormous problems with our roads in eastern North Carolina. 
   I have also spoken with Secretary Glickman, Secretary of Agriculture, because of our concern for the farmers in North Carolina. The tobacco farmers and the farmers of all kinds in eastern North Carolina are going to suffer enormous crop damage as a result of the devastation created by this hurricane. 
   As I mentioned earlier, these are folks who are already struggling, already suffering, and already under enormous financial stress. And now here comes Hurricane Floyd putting what for many of them, I am afraid, will be the final nail in the coffin. These folks are going to need our help. 
   The bottom line is that while this hurricane has now moved out of North Carolina, it has created enormous damage. I think the devastation will be extraordinary once we have had a chance to go in and assess exactly what the damage has been. 
   As we go through the process of passing these various appropriations bills that the Senate is working very diligently on, I have asked my colleagues to keep in mind that the people of North Carolina, including the farmers of North Carolina, are desperately going to need help. They need help quickly, and they need that help getting to them in time to respond to the devastation that Hurricane Floyd has created. 
   I ask my colleagues in the Senate to keep that in mind. We will be in regular touch with the folks involved in appropriations in order to make them aware of the specific problems that we have in North Carolina. 
   I also add that this injury and this damage is not limited to North Carolina. I am absolutely certain there is damage in Florida, Georgia, and South Carolina. As the storm moves north through Virginia and Maryland, I anticipate there will also be damage in those States. 
   I ask my colleagues not only from those States but all of my colleagues in the Senate to be prepared to respond and respond quickly to a devastating blow that has been dealt to my State of North Carolina and to the surrounding States that have been hit by Hurricane Floyd. 
   Finally, I would like to say just a word about the people of 
   North Carolina and their response to this hurricane. 
   The people of North Carolina, fortunately, are very experienced in dealing with hurricanes. They have been hit time and time again. I have to say we have gotten way more than our fair share of hurricanes and hurricane damage. The response of folks in eastern North Carolina has been heroic. It was absolutely extraordinary to watch their discipline and preparation when they saw the storm coming, their organized and coordinated effort to evacuate the coast when those evacuations were necessary, and their preparation for what they knew was inevitable, which was that Hurricane Floyd was going to come through eastern North Carolina and wreak havoc and devastation. 
   I am so proud of the people of North Carolina who have responded so heroically and in such a well-organized way to what they knew was coming, and I expect that response will continue over the next weeks and months as we begin the efforts of cleaning up the devastation that has been created by Hurricane Floyd. 
   Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.

   Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, I rise to elaborate on my amendment that would provide $200,000 in funding under the Cooperative State Research, Education, and Extension Service (CSREES) to a research project in North Carolina to improve early detection of crop diseases. This funding boost is accomplished through an offset in NRI. 
   This funding would go to North Carolina State which will work in conjunction with the University of North Carolina at Greensboro to create an innovative early warning system for crop failure. 
   Mr. President, more than 30% of crop failures could be prevented if farmers had an early warning of disease or insect damage. However, by the time most diseases and insect infestations are visible to the naked eye, they are too far advanced for effective treatment. 
   The University of North Carolina at Greensboro has been conducting a series of experiments that would introduce a color-change gene into crops such as soybeans and cranberries. These crops could be genetically engineered to change color when under stress, insect attack or diseased. A farmer could then shine a black light on the leaves and see the damage long before it is visible to the naked eye. Armed with this early warning, he could begin dealing with the problem long before it becomes fatal to the crop. 
   This is an important project to support. The research will help bring crop management into the 21st century and could help farmers avert needless disasters. And it could yield enormous benefits soon.

   Mr. EDWARDS. Madam President, I rise today to urge my colleagues to vote in favor of the sweepstakes legislation, which is S. 335, the Deceptive Mail Prevention and Enforcement Act. 
   Let me say first, I thank my colleague, Senator LEVIN--I do not see him on the floor right now--also, my colleague, Senator COLLINS. They worked so hard and so long on this remarkably important piece of legislation. 
   Let me start by telling a story. It is a story I have told before, but I think it goes to the very heart of what this legislation is about. 
   There is an elderly man in North Carolina who lives in Raleigh, NC, I believe--right outside of Raleigh--named Bobby Bagwell. Bobby Bagwell is an elderly man who was watched over by his family, his daughter-in-law. Although he lived alone, he had a difficult time living alone. 
   His daughter-in-law went over to his house one day. When going through his various belongings, she discovered boxes and boxes of sweepstakes mailings. She came to discover in addition to that, in response to these sweepstakes mailings, Mr. Bagwell had purchased thousands and thousands of dollars of devices--goods that were basically useless. They were of no value to him at all. When she questioned her father-in-law about why he had bought these goods, the response was that he believed it would increase his chances of winning the sweepstakes. He had spent, I think, something on the order of $20,000, which was basically his life's savings, on purchasing this useless, worthless material. 
   As I mentioned earlier, Mr. Bagwell was an elderly man. For that reason, he was vulnerable. But there is an even worse part to this story. Mr. Bagwell, as it turns out, suffers from dementia. So he could not remember from day to day what he had bought, how much money he had spent, or why he had spent it. His daughter-in-law, doing everything in her power to do something about this very sad situation, contacted the sweepstakes companies, asking them to take him off the mailing lists. She got no response. She then sent a doctor's order to the sweepstakes companies saying, ``My father-in-law suffers from dementia. I ask you, take him off your lists for sweepstakes mailings because he is buying all these goods, he doesn't remember that he is spending his life's savings, and we need to take him off the lists so he does not continue to engage in this kind of behavior.'' For the second time, she got no response. 
   Finally, when they contacted me and I became aware of the situation and I contacted the sweepstakes companies,  they responded appropriately and took him off the lists. 
   The sad part of this story is that in this country, in this day and time, it was necessary for a Senator to contact the sweepstakes companies in order to get this accomplished. That goes to the very heart of what this sweepstakes legislation is about. It is the reason Senator COLLINS has done such a remarkable job in conducting hearings and bringing this matter to the attention of the American people so something can be done about it. It is something for which I believe we have broad bipartisan support, support on both sides of the aisle. Everyone knows and recognizes something needs to be done about this problem. 
   I do want to discuss one specific feature. The bill has many wonderful provisions, including provisions that require the sweepstakes companies, for example, to tell people that buying these goods does not increase their chances of winning. That would save a man such as Bobby Bagwell from being taken advantage of. 
   One specific provision I worked on awfully hard, with Senator COLLINS and Senator LEVIN, basically provides that sweepstakes companies be required to provide a vehicle for people to be taken off these mailing lists so someone such as Bobby Bagwell, who has dementia, an elderly person who is being taken advantage of, who is vulnerable, can be protected and can be taken off the lists. In 
   addition to that, it helps every North Carolinian--in my case--and every American who simply does not want to continue to receive these sweepstakes mailings. 
   We all recognized during the course of the hearings there are some reputable, legitimate companies that engage in these sweepstakes techniques as a marketing tool. But people need to have a way to get off these lists if they want to get off the lists. One of the provisions in this legislation specifically provides for that. 
   The bottom line is this. This legislation goes a long way toward eliminating any sort of deceptive, misleading sweepstakes mailings. It allows people who do not want to receive these mailings to no longer receive them. Ultimately, what it does is it empowers American families who want to make sure the elderly members of their families--their parents, their in-laws--are taken care of. It empowers them to make sure they are not taken advantage of with these sweepstakes mailings, and in fact, if they so choose, that they no longer continue to receive these mailings. 
   This is a wonderful piece of legislation. As I mentioned earlier, it has bipartisan support. I am very proud to have worked with Senator COLLINS and Senator LEVIN, who have done a tremendous job for the American people in connection with this legislation.

   Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, I rise today to oppose S. 1429. Passing this bill is like going on a spending spree just because a sweepstakes company tells you ``you might be a winner.'' 
   I support tax cuts. The question for me is, when? I am a fiscal conservative and am happy to vote for tax cuts. Any tax cut, however, needs to be done in a fiscally-responsible manner. This is common sense. 
   But we need to look at the big picture, and we can't engage in wishful thinking. So when we talk about cutting taxes we must do it in the same breath as paying down the national debt and dealing with Social Security and Medicare. 
   We should cut government spending. Working Americans pay taxes to the federal government, and that money buys a lot of great things. But we have a responsibility and obligation to only spend what is absolutely necessary, and I am afraid that we haven't done a very good job of that. The federal government is too big and spends too much, and we need to do something about it. 
   We should pay down the public debt. If we reduce our public debt, we reduce the money the federal government owes to foreign investors and other bondholders. If we reduce our public debt--a debt that has accumulated because of out-of-control government spending in years past--it will lower interest rates, increase investment in America's economy, and help ensure our economy's continued growth and success. That has real benefits for average Americans: lower mortgage interest rates and a booming economy. 
   This isn't inside-the-Beltway stuff. This is important to North Carolinians and all other Americans. And I think all of them can relate to why it is unwise to cut taxes before we are certain there is a surplus and before we are on the road to securing the future of Social Security and Medicare. 
   Look into your crystal ball. How much will you be earning in the year 2008? Will your 10-year-old be going to Duke or UNC, and what will be the tuition? What are you going to pay for health insurance during the next 10 years? And how much can you put away for retirement? 
   I think these questions are important to North Carolinians and all other Americans. I have been thinking about how a family might try to answer these questions, and two things come to mind. 
   First, answers are extremely difficult to find with any degree of certainty. Unforseen expenses can arise. And other factors--career changes, interest rates, or family size--may also affect the answers. It seems to me very likely, given this uncertainty, that a family would be very cautious about their financial planning. 
   Second, if that family had to make a decision now about which one of those items they would forego if they needed extra money to cover unforseen expenses, which one would it be? 
   If making these projections for a family is difficult, what can be said about the difficulty of predicting the federal government's budget 10 years? 
   I'll tell you what I think about it. I think it is extremely difficult. And I am not alone. 
   I had an exchange the day before yesterday with Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan during a hearing. I talked to him about his earlier comments about the surplus, the proposed tax cuts and about the problems the federal government has showing restraint. 
   Mr. Greenspan noted that these projections are rarely accurate. 
   His advice, then, is very simple and practical: wait. ``Several years,'' he said. ``In other words, one year, two years.'' Chairman Greenspan said he favors paying down the public debt--not using any surplus for increasing government spending. 
   It is hard to wait. This has been a real struggle. I break with the President, with my party and with the Republican party. But I do so because first and foremost we should not imperil our unprecedented economic prosperity by moving too quickly. To put it simply: look before you leap. A huge tax cut today is like entering the biggest watermelon contest the day after an especially good-looking vine sprouts up. 
   I, myself, just don't have that much confidence that we have a surplus at all or that the economic assumptions underlying the surplus projections are reliable. It feels like smoke and mirrors--hocus pocus. And when people waive around numbers like $1 trillion, it's hard not to get swept away. 
   But if we step back and take a look at the facts, we get a more frightening picture. If government spending is 1 percent higher than projected and revenues are 1 percent lower than projected, then the so-called $1 trillion surplus would be off by $170 billion annually. 
   When it comes to government spending, the truth is Congress has 
   not been able to live within its budgets. Federal spending should be cut, but let's not be naive: Congress has bad spending habits. 
   Current projections are based on assumptions about our spending habits that everyone admits have been impossible to live with. This is a fact. I want to remind everyone that this body passed a $12 billion ``emergency'' spending package--raiding the Social Security Trust Fund--earlier this year. I voted against that package because nearly half of it was spending that no honest person would consider an ``emergency.'' We've also been pouring money into defense spending--something I support--but it's not within the budget we tried to set for the government. We can't stick to our limits now, and yet we are talking about a tax cut  based on the assumption that we are going to spend less. This just doesn't make sense to me. 
   Having noted that we never stay within the spending caps, let me say that we should not give up on them. They are important. And, despite our history of breaking them, they have acted to keep our spending lower than it would have been otherwise. This is important because we need to make sure that the federal government doesn't just spend money because taxpayers send it to us. We need to constantly look for ways to cut unnecessary spending and pressure the federal government to operate more efficiently. 
   Even as we propose to dramatically cut taxes based on the fantasy that we will control spending and enjoy unprecedented economic prosperity, we are hiding our head in the sand about a very real and very near fiscal catastrophe. In 2012, we will need to pay more for Medicare than we have. We'll need to dip into a Medicare trust fund. But there is no Medicare trust fund. In 2014, Social Security benefits paid out will exceed receipts, and we will have to start dipping into the trust fund. This tax cut puts the cart before the horse. Cut taxes and then try to figure out how to deal with a looming crisis? No one could call that fiscally responsible. 
   What if there's a real emergency? This bill leaves me worried. Suppose a Class 5 hurricane were to strike North Carolina sometime in the next few years. If we needed emergency relief, this proposal could leave us high and dry--or taking a dip into Social Security. 
   North Carolinians might be excused for thinking that the current tax debate sounds like hocus pocus. And they might be excused for wondering whether people are making promises they can't keep. This government has made a great many promises: 
   Putting more money in your pocket; 
   Saving Social Security; 
   Reserving money for Medicare; 
   Improving Veterans' health care; 
   Funding for the National Institute of Health; 
   Putting 100,000 cops on the street; 
   Aiding America's farmers; 
   Funding for programs like Head Start; 
   Maintaining interstate highways; and 
   Supporting National Missile Defense and other spending to ensure a strong national defense. 
   I don't think we can keep all of these promises. And I can't bring myself to bait the American public with a tax cut only to be forced to cut their legs off on Social Security, Medicare and debt reduction or raise taxes again. 
   If not now, when? 
   I heard this question asked earlier today about tax cuts. My answer is the same as the one Chairman Greenspan gave at the hearing yesterday--he said wait a few years. 
   After a few years we may know a few things. 
   First, are we keeping spending reasonably under control? 
   Second, have we saved Social Security and reformed Medicare? 
   Third, how's the economy doing? 
   Fourth, have we paid down some of our national debt? 
   Our first real test will come this fall--when we will again start the process that will lead to meeting--or breaking--the spending caps. The federal government needs to prove to the American public that it can operate under its own budgetary limits. If we can do this, if we can break the habit of busting the budget caps, we will then be able to tell if we do in fact have a surplus. 
   I want the American people to know this: I am for cutting taxes paid by working Americans. We've got an amazingly successful economy right now. I want to make sure when I cast my vote that I'm voting for something that will ensure, not destroy, the continued growth of our economy. Right now, the projections are too speculative, the assumptions too unrealistic, and to me, the solution is obvious. We should not spend money until we know we have it--and when we do have it, we need to give it back to working Americans.

   Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, I rise to introduce with my colleague KAY BAILEY HUTCHISON the Tax Exempt Military Pay Orders (TEMPO) Act. This measure will not only correct an inequity in the way we treat our deployed armed forces, but it also will help let our soldiers know that we recognize and appreciate the sacrifices they and their families make. 
   Our proposal would provide that income received by a member of the Armed Forces of the United States, while receiving special pay, should be tax exempt. Currently, members of the U.S. Armed Forces who serve in a Presidentially designated ``combat zone'' receive special tax exemptions. I think we all recall that this exemption was in effect during Kosovo. During Kosovo, soldiers did not have to pay excise taxes on phone calls that they make from the combat zone. Nor did they have to pay income taxes on the money earned while in that zone. 
   The measure we introduce today provides that these same tax exemptions would be triggered when the Secretary of Defense designates his employees as eligible for ``special pay'' based on hostile conditions. Under current law, members of the Armed Forces receive special pay when: subject to hostile fire; on duty in which he, or others with him, are in imminent danger of such fire; were killed, injured or wounded by hostile fire or were on duty in a foreign area in which he was subject to the threat of physical harm or imminent danger on the basis of civil insurrection, civil war, terrorism, or wartime conditions. In the last few years soldiers in Somalia and Haiti have received special pay. 
   Let me explain why I believe we need to change the tax treatment of special pay. The original tax exemption for combat pay was put in place during the Korean war. From that time until the fall of the Berlin Wall, the employment of U.S. forces almost always was in combat zones. But since the end of the cold war, as we all know, our Armed Forces have been deployed more often, and in a wider variety of circumstances. Today, a soldier with the 82nd Airborne from North Carolina may be sent on a mission that is as dangerous as any combat mission, but because it is not precisely in a combat zone, he cannot receive any tax benefits. 
   Given the current uses of our Armed Forces, I believe the measure we propose today makes a great deal of sense. I also believe that making this change in the tax code would correct an inequity. Now, I think it is only right that soldiers in the Kosovo engagement are receiving tax exemptions. But during a recent visit to Fort Bragg, many soldiers and their families commented that the same benefits should have been extended to the soldiers who served in Somalia and Haiti. I have to say that I agreed with them. 
   And so, this bill addresses the new realities of the post-code-war world. As the Senate knows all too well, the end of the cold war brought with it a significant drawdown in the size of our armed forces. Additionally, we shifted from an overseas-based force to one based primarily in the United States. Almost concurrently, our national security strategy has lead us into an era of seemingly continuous deployments. In the 40 years between 1950 and 1990, elements of the U.S. Army were deployed 10 times. In the less than 10 years since the fall of the Berlin Wall, elements of the Army have been deployed 34 times. The Navy's responses have doubled in the 90's. The Air Force has seen its deployed forces rise 400% while its active duty personnel dropped 33%. Some of these deployments are a few months in duration; some are part  of a continuous presence--such as our forces in the Sinai. All work hardship on both the members deployed and their families, particularly when there are repeated or back-to-back deployments. 
   These demands contribute to both recruitment and retention problems. In recognition of these demands and of the likelihood that we will continue to see more of these deployments, this bill recognizes that we need to bring our tax code up to date so that it acknowledges these new realities. 
   Mr. President, let me tell you more about what this proposal would do. As I previously said, members of the military who receive combat pay get certain tax exemptions. For example: 
   The income of the soldier while in the combat zone is tax exempt. So is the income of a soldier while hospitalized for injuries received in the combat zone and that portion of a pension or retirement acquired while in a combat zone. In addition, pay received while a prisoner of war as a result of service in the combat zone is tax exempt. 
   Special tax rates apply for the surviving spouse of a soldier who is missing in action (or presumed dead) in a combat zone. 
   All taxes are eliminated for the years the soldier served in the combat zone if he is killed in the combat zone.

   Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of this amendment. I particularly want to address the issue of financial incentives, which this amendment addresses, which essentially is HMOs and health insurance companies providing financial incentives for physicians to provide less than appropriate care to limit the treatment options for patients or, in the case I am about to talk about, not calling in other physicians or doctors when they may be needed under the circumstances. 
   This is the story of something that actually happened in North Carolina. 
   A young mother was in labor. During the course of her labor, she was being overseen by an obstetrician/gynecologist who was responsible for her care. Unfortunately, this single OB/GYN was responsible for the care of a number of mothers in labor on this night. 
   During the course of the evening and the morning, the mother developed severe complications with her labor. There were clear signs the baby was in serious trouble and was having trouble getting oxygen and needed to be delivered. Something needed to be done immediately. The nurses taking care of this mother did exactly what good nurses would do under the circumstances: They paged the doctor. They called the doctor who was on call. They could not get him there. They had no understanding of why he was not responding to the call. They notified, by way of the call, that it was an emergency situation. Still no response. 
   More and more time was passing when the child within the mother's womb was not receiving the oxygen it needed and continued to suffer injury and damage. 
   Finally, the doctor appeared and delivered the baby by cesarean section. Unfortunately for this child and the family, it was too late. The child suffered severe and serious permanent brain injury. The child has severe cerebral palsy and, essentially, will require extensive medical care for the course of its life. 
   Later we learned that what happened was the physician who was in charge of this patient's care had a financial incentive, because of his contract with the HMO, not to call in additional physicians. In other words, he was rewarded where, on a consistent basis, he did not call in backup help--even though in this situation he was taking care of too many patients, too many mothers. 
   There was an emergency, and the bottom line is this: Because of a financial incentive, an insurance HMO credit with its doctor, we have a young child who will have cerebral palsy for the rest of his life. This is the kind of thing that should not happen in America. This is what this amendment addresses. It specifically deals with the issue of financial incentives in a thoughtful, intelligent way, limiting the financial incentives that can be allowed and requiring their disclosure--both of which are absolutely needed and absolutely necessary. 
   I might add one final thought. This child, who for the rest of his life will be severely brain damaged, will require extensive medical care, very expensive medical care, running in the many millions of dollars. His family, who are responsible for this child's care, who live with this problem 24 hours a day, day in and day out, year after year--this child's medical care is being paid for by Medicaid.

   Mr. EDWARDS. Since this child suffers from a severe injury as a direct result of an incentive that the HMO, the health insurance company, provided to the doctor, since this child suffers this severe injury and will have millions of dollars of medical problems over the course of his life, the question is, Who pays for this cost? The HMO is not going to pay for it. Who is going to pay for it is the taxpayers of America, through Medicaid. 
   So the financial burden of what happened as a result of this financial incentives clause, a clause which is absolutely fundamentally wrong and should not be allowed, is that every American taxpayer is responsible for carrying the burden of these millions of dollars in medical costs. 
   Thank you, Mr. President.

   Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, let me address the external appeals part of this amendment. Yesterday afternoon, we had a debate, at which time I brought to the attention of my colleagues on the other side the fact that, essentially, we had no enforcement mechanism for any of the provisions passed because there was no meaningful external review, the reason being insurance companies got to write the language on what is medically necessary, and the only thing that was appealable was what is medically necessary. 
   That being the case--that the insurance company totally controlled whether there could be an appeal at all--not having a meaningful appeal is similar to having a law without a police force or a court system. There is no way to enforce it. The law is meaningless. All of these provisions we pass are meaningless unless they are enforceable. 
   This amendment attempts--and I applaud my colleagues for making this effort. I think it is the result of a discussion we had yesterday. It attempts to address that problem, but it still has an enormous problem in it. There are two parts of an appeal process. The first is, do you get to appeal? The second is, if there is an appeal, what can be considered? 
   What they have offered by way of different language today, for the first time in the course of this week, is some change in what can be considered if there is an appeal. They don't change, in any way, what is appealable. Once again, the only thing appealable is medical necessity. You can't appeal whether you have access to a specialist. You can't appeal whether you were reasonably prudent in going to the emergency room. All that long list of things which are contained in the various provisions that have been considered are not appealable. The only thing appealable is medical necessity. The insurance company writes what medical necessity means. They can write it any way they want. 
   So the problem is, while they have attempted to address the second part of the appeals process--and I applaud them for that --they have not addressed in any way the first part, which means the insurance company lawyers can write the contracts in a way that essentially makes appeals impossible by simply drafting very narrow language of what medical necessity means. If they do that, then nobody gets their foot in the door. 
   What we have done basically is we have taken a door that was completely closed and put a very tiny crack in it. That is all that has happened. Instead of what we ought to be doing, which is to have a simple, plain provision--and I don't know why my colleagues won't agree with this; maybe they will if we talk about it--a plain provision which says any right provided in any part of these amendments and bills that have been passed is appealable. 
   Why not make them all appealable? That way, we have an enforcement mechanism. We have a police force, a court system, and we have a way to make the rights that we are attempting to create meaningful because if we don't do that, essentially what happens is we pass laws that are totally unenforceable. The result is the insurance company totally controls what occurs. What we have today is a situation where HMOs and insurance companies are totally in control. That is what we are about this week. We are about changing that. 
   I do applaud my colleagues for making some effort to address that issue. But what has happened is they only address the second part, which is what can be considered. They still, I might add, allow the party considering the appeal, which is chosen by the insurance company through another entity, to consider what the HMOs' own plans and procedures are. So the bottom line is this, Mr. President--

   Mr. EDWARDS. The bottom line is this: What we have is a provision that does not cure the problem. There is a simple cure, and if we are doing this in good faith, I ask my colleagues to join me in that cure, which is a simple provision which says that any right created in these amendments, in these patient protections we are attempting to debate and pass on the floor, is appealable. It is that simple, that straightforward. If we want to enforce these  laws against the insurance companies, that is what we ought to be doing. It is simple and straightforward and it will work. 
   I thank the Chair.

   Mr. EDWARDS. Thank you, Mr. President. 
   Mr. President, actually for almost 20 years before I came to the Senate, I had an opportunity to see firsthand what insurance companies do to people because of the type of work I did. 
   What I saw was they take people's money. They deny them coverage when they need it, and when they need them the worst, they are never there. 
   What I have seen on the floor of the Senate for the last week is what insurance companies do in Washington. 
   What they do is this: They make certain that the power in the health care industry in this country remains with them. 
   They have done that in a remarkably effective way. It has been extraordinary to watch what has happened over the course of the last week. 
   It boils down to--at least, to me as a first-time observer of this--a very simple fact. On the floor of the Senate this week, insurance companies have won and the American family has lost. The children, parents, and members of American families have lost and the insurance companies have won. This is what has happened. 
   No. 1, insurance companies cannot be held accountable. They absolutely cannot be held accountable. They have done everything they can do to make sure that occurs. The reason for that is very simple. I have listened to my colleagues on the other side argue with great emotion that we want to turn health care over to lawyers. 
   Exactly the opposite is true. This is why. What happens, in every amendment, in every single bill--including the underlying bill offered by the other side--this language appears: ``when medically necessary and appropriate under the terms and conditions of the plan.'' That language is the killer language. It is the language the insurance companies need, that they desperately want, and that they have gotten. It is the language that is going to remove any power from any patient or any family or any doctor in America as a result of what is passed on the floor. 
   The reason they are wrong about lawyers is because the plans control. Under what has passed during the course of this week, the plans always control. They control what benefit patients receive to begin with; they control what patients can appeal; they control what happens on appeal. 
   I ask the American people: Who do you believe writes these plans for the big HMO companies of America? Who do you think writes these plans? Lawyers. Their teams of lawyers write these plans. 
   When we leave the floor tonight, starting tomorrow, everything that is passed will be handed to the HMOs; the very first thing they will do is get in their cars and drive down to their big law firms and hand these over to the lawyers and the lawyers will go to work. What the lawyers are going to do is write health care plans that make absolutely certain the insurance companies have total control over what happens, they have control over the initial benefit, they have control over the appeals process, and that they cannot, under any circumstances, be held accountable.

<TEXT>
   Mr. EDWARDS. Absolutely. 
   What will happen is that the lawyers will write the plans, and under every single thing we have passed during the course of this week, the plan controls; the insurance company controls. 
   If anyone thinks for a minute that the lawyers who are hired by these insurance companies are not going to write the 
   plans in a way that protects the plan and the HMOs and never protects the patient, they are living in never-never land. That is exactly what will happen. 
   As a result, in its simplest terms, the insurance company and their team of lawyers have won this battle. The patients have lost. 
   One last thing. We have heard lots of talk about cost from the other side. That is a false argument. It is a false argument for a simple reason. No. 1, what will happen under our real Patients' Bill of Rights is that we get patients to emergency rooms, to specialists, to the doctors who they really need to see as quickly as possible. That has an extraordinarily important cost effect, which is they get treated more quickly, their condition and disease is diagnosed more quickly, and as a result the long-term costs associated with that are reduced. 
   Our bill will reduce costs over the long haul. It will absolutely reduce costs when the long-term expenses and costs are considered. 
   Second, when an HMO or health insurance company acts recklessly and irresponsibly and a child, for example, is severely injured and that child incurs millions and millions of health care costs over the course of his or her lifetime, the health insurance will not be held accountable. No way are they held accountable. Those costs--the millions and millions of dollars--don't go away. 
   The question is, Who pays? The American people pay. The American taxpayers pay. They pay through Medicaid. That is the only way those costs will be paid. Instead of an HMO being responsible for paying, the American taxpayer pays. The people listening to this pay.

   Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, I say to my colleagues and to the Senator from Tennessee that I suffer from the disadvantage of having seen this amendment only for a short period of time, as my other colleagues have. But just in that short period of time, I have found what appear to me to be--and I am perfectly willing to listen to an explanation--three gaping holes in this amendment, particularly as it relates to the issue of specialty care. I think our amendment completely closes those holes. 
   Hole No. 1: Even though the bill provides for timely specialty care in accordance with the exigencies of the case of access to primary and specialty care specialists--that on the surface sounds wonderful--here is the problem. There are three huge holes in that provision. 
   No. 1, the plan can still do anything it wants to control costs, which means the plan can have a provision that essentially wipes out access to some particular specialty, or some particular kind of specialty care, in order to control costs. All they have to do is justify it on that basis, which is to control costs. 
   So they can essentially eliminate the value and substance of this provision by simply saying, as they do every day now: We are doing this on the basis of cost. That is the reason the HMO is doing this. We have to do it for cost control--so they can keep kids from seeing specialists and so they can keep adults from seeing specialists. And their justification is, they are controlling costs. 
   Huge gaping loophole No. 2: They can still condition access to a specialist in a treatment plan, which means the HMO can provide a treatment plan that is completely contrary to what the medical professionals taking care of the patient believe the patient needs to see in terms of a specialist. 
   If that treatment plan--written by the health insurance company, written by the HMO--is inconsistent with what the doctor is doing in taking care of, for example, a young child whom he believes he needs to see in terms of a pediatric specialist, then the right to see a pediatric specialist is gone. 
   So we already have two huge gaping holes: 
   No. 1, the HMO can keep people from seeing specialists by just saying, we are controlling costs. That is as simple as that. It is over. Control is in the hands of the health insurance company. 
   No. 2, if they say we have a treatment plan that is different from what the treating doctors say the child needs, they can keep the child from seeing a specialist, completely eliminating the right. 
   And the killer is gaping hole No. 3, particularly working in combination with the other two, which is, there is no right to an external appeal. 
   The result of this is, if the HMO says, we are not going to let you see a specialist because of cost, we are not going to let you see a specialist because we have a treatment plan that is inconsistent with what the treating doctors say, the patient is completely out of luck. They can't do a single thing about it. They have no right to an external appeal. They are completely stuck. The power remains entirely in the hands of the HMO and the health insurance company. 
   It doesn't cure it in any way because of the extraordinary problems we have with access to specialty care today. 
   Thank you, Mr. President.

   Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, first, I join my colleagues, Senators BINGAMAN and HARKIN, in support of their amendment. I strongly support it. They have made great cases for it. 
   There is another issue I will address that goes to this amendment but also goes to the amendment presently pending from the other side which deals with issues of specialty care, emergency room care, and OB/GYN care. I want the American people who are listening to this debate to listen carefully to what I am about to say. 
   There is a huge, fundamental issue we are debating in the Senate this week. That issue is, are health care decisions going to be made by doctors and patients, or are they going to be made by insurance companies and HMOs. 
   Every provision that has passed and has been proposed, including this amendment presently before us, leaves power in the insurance company. It leaves power in the HMO. The arguments we hear that these bills are true patient protections are entirely circular. 
   If the American people believe insurance companies and HMOs should continue to make all the decisions, should continue to have control of the process, then they should support what our colleagues on the other side have been supporting. If they believe there needs to be a change in that system, then they should support what we are proposing and supporting. 
   The very simple reason--it is easy to understand--why their bills change nothing about the present system is because there is no way to enforce them. They allow appeals only on the issue of what is medically necessary. It is the only thing that is appealable. What is medically necessary is determined by the HMO and the health insurance company. They write in the contract what is medically necessary. So no matter what we do in the Senate, no matter what we pass, so long as the insurance company and the HMO can define what is medically necessary--and we have seen some ludicrous definitions discussed on the floor, including, for example, that it shall be in the sole discretion of the HMO and health insurance company to determine what is medically necessary, which means they can do anything they want, since that is the only thing that is appealable and, therefore, the only thing that is enforceable--the HMO has total control over this process. The patient has no power whatsoever. 
   To me, it is as if having a law saying you can't steal money from people but not having a court system to enforce it, not having a police force to enforce it. So when somebody steals something from you, you say: Wait a minute, you can't do that. That is against the law. And the person who has just stolen from you says: So what? What are you going to do about it? 
   What we have done is left the power entirely in the hands of the HMO to determine what is medically necessary and, as a result, to determine what is appealable. The only enforcement that any patient has is the appeal, which means the health insurance company has total control of the entire process. 
   This argument is completely circular. It makes no difference what we pass. We can pass anything--OB/GYN reform, emergency room reform, specialists reform. It doesn't matter. The health insurance company gets to determine what is medically necessary. The health insurance company gets to determine, therefore, what is appealable. 
   Those things have already passed, before this debate that is going on right now. 
   The bottom line is this: Patients have no power; they have no ability to enforce anything. As long as the health insurance company maintains control over the appeal and grievance process, as long as they maintain control over the only enforcement mechanism that exists, we have no police, we have no court, we have no way to hold the HMOs accountable. 
   When we finish the debate this week, and whatever passes here, HMOs are going to have a field day. They are going to go back with their teams of lawyers, and they are going to write contracts that completely protect them from any patient ever being able to appeal anything. That is all they  have to do. There is nothing in anything we have passed thus far that will prevent them from doing that. They can write their contracts any way they want. They get to decide what is medically necessary. What I have just talked about applies to everything; it applies to everything that has passed thus far. 
   I will say what my colleagues have said. If what I am saying is not true, why don't we simply say, for example, in the amendment that is presently pending from the other side, which deals with OB/GYN, emergency room care, specialist care--why don't we put one sentence in that says: Any denial of services under this amendment shall be subject to independent appeal and review. 
   That is all it would take. Then it is enforceable. Then you have police and a court system. But when that doesn't exist --and it doesn't exist, in my opinion, for a reason, in that amendment. I might add, that it is clearly stated in the amendment that Senator BINGAMAN has just offered. There is a direct, independent appeal if the HMO denies service. 
   It is very simple. It is a question of who has power. The way we live in the health care system in this country, the power rests with the HMO and the health insurance company. I hoped that the debate on the floor this week would be about how we can go about shifting that pendulum so we put more power in the hands of patients, more power in the hands of doctors, that we would pass some thoughtful, moderate legislation that would move the pendulum back to the middle. 
   Unfortunately, as long as there is no way to enforce it, as long as the HMO can write the contract any way they want, they can define medical necessity. They define the appeal process and, therefore, they can eliminate the right to enforce anything. The power rests entirely with the HMO and entirely with the health insurance company, which is where it is today, and that is what I believe we need to do something about.

   Mr. EDWARDS. I am reading from your bill, where it specifically says what is appealable is what is medically necessary and appropriate ``under the terms and conditions of the plan''--under the terms and conditions of the plan written by the health insurance company. Your own bill specifically says that the only thing that is appealable is what the insurance company's written plan says is medically necessary. How does that change the power from the insurance company having total control over the enforcement mechanism?

   Mr. EDWARDS. I respectfully suggest that what I am reading from is the actual bill. 
   Let me ask the Senator one last, simple question. If what he is saying is true, is the Senator willing to put in the amendment presently before us OB/GYN care, specialty care, and emergency room care? On those three provisions, is he willing to put in a specific provision that says denial of any of those services is directly appealable to an independent body? Would he be willing to do that?

   Mr. EDWARDS. I am looking at page 30 of the actual amendment that has been offered. Looking under subsection (B)(ii), this is the designation of independent external reviewer, which goes to the very heart of whether the review is independent or, in fact, is not independent. In subsection (ii) it says there is a requirement that the reviewer ``not have any material, professional, familial, or financial affiliation with the case under review.'' 
   My question to the Senator is--and I would like to see the language in the actual amendment, if he could point to it--what is it that requires that the reviewer not have an ongoing financial relationship with the health insurance company or with the HMO, which would in fact, as the Senator I am sure would recognize, make them not independent?

   Mr. EDWARDS. I thank the Senator very much, and I reclaim the remainder of my time. 
   Mr. President, there are two fundamental problems with this amendment that go to the very heart of this debate. First, as my colleague from New York pointed out, this review is not an independent review. It is not an independent review by any definition of independence. The reason is, No. 1, the health insurance company, the HMO, chooses the entity which chooses the reviewer. I want to be precise here. That is exactly what the bill provides. The health insurance company chooses an entity; that entity chooses the reviewer. So the health insurance company has control over who ultimately does the review. 
   No. 2, the only requirement with respect to financial independence or professional independence is the requirement that I just read to the Senator from Pennsylvania, that the reviewing entity not have a financial or professional relationship with the very specific case under review, which means there is nothing to prohibit a reviewer, the so-called independent reviewing body under their amendment, from being somebody who has a longstanding, ongoing relationship with the health insurance company or with the HMO. 
   Nobody in America, certainly none of my colleagues in the Senate, would believe that an independent review could be conducted by somebody who has an ongoing contractual relationship and receives money from the health insurance company. There is absolutely nothing in this bill which prohibits that. That is why the Senator from New York and I have proposed an amendment that makes it very clear that there is a truly independent reviewing body. That independence is critical and to the very heart of the review process. It is why we need it. 
   I notice both the junior and the senior Senators from Pennsylvania are on the floor now. In Pennsylvania, these reviews are conducted by a State regulatory body. They are not conducted by some person chosen by an HMO or a health insurance company. Second, in terms of what can be reviewed under the State law of Pennsylvania, any consumer grievance can be reviewed. It is not, as this bill is, limited to what constitutes medical necessity. 
   Third, under the law of the State of Pennsylvania, the review is de novo, which is absolutely not what this amendment provides. 
   Let me go back and summarize where we are. No. 1, we don't have, under this amendment, an independent review. We don't have it for two fundamental reasons: No. 1, the health insurance company, the HMO, is allowed to select the body that picks the reviewer. No. 2, the reviewing body is allowed to have a longstanding professional or financial relationship with the HMO that has denied the claim. There is absolutely nothing to prohibit that under this bill. Our amendment, which will be considered at a later time, would not allow that. So there is no independent review. 
   The second problem is--and this goes to the amendment offered by my colleague from California--this review process is meaningless so long as the reviewing body is bound by the definition of medical necessity contained and written by the HMO. It is absolutely bound by the language of the HMO. 
   I will add, in committee--I see my colleagues from Massachusetts and Tennessee are here--Senator KENNEDY asked a question to Senator FRIST. The question was:  
   Would the Senator accept language that mentions that the decision would be made independent of the words of the contract?  
   The question Senator KENNEDY posed was: Would you agree that in the appeals process, the determination could be made without regard to the HMO-written definition of medical necessity? 
   Senator FRIST's answer was: ``No, sir,'' in the committee. So he would not concur to not be bound by the language in the HMO or health insurance contract. 
   So there are two fundamental problems, and they work in concert to be devastating and to make this amendment devastating to the whole concept of the Patients' Bill of Rights. 
   No. 1, there is no independent review. The people are picked by the HMO, and they are allowed to have an ongoing financial relationship with the HMO. No. 2, they are bound by an HMO-written definition of medical necessity. That is the very heart of the amendment of my colleague from California, because what this debate is ultimately about is whether health care decisions are going to be made by medical professionals, doctors, or whether they are going to be made by insurance company bureaucrats.

   Mr. EDWARDS. Under the definition the Senator has just read--and I might point out the appeals process that is contained in this amendment is completely controlled by the HMO or health insurance company's definition of medical necessity. Throughout the process it is totally controlled by it.

   Mr. EDWARDS. That is absolutely correct. 
   Let's suppose we had a young child who needed a particular kind of care and every physician who had treated that child recommended the care for the child. But there was a less costly procedure that could be used, so the care was denied. Throughout the appeals process, the determination of whether it ought to be reversed or not would be based on what is the least costly, because it is totally controlled by the definition written by the HMO. 
   In the language the Senator from California has just read to me, where it says it shall be within the ``sole discretion,'' what that ultimately means is whatever appealing body is deciding, which is bound by that definition, which they are by this amendment--if they are bound by that definition, every appealing body would be 
   left with no alternative but to affirm the decision because the contract says it is left within the sole discretion of the HMO. 
   It goes to the very heart of the Senator's amendment. It goes to the very heart of this debate. The whole question is, Are health insurance bureaucrats going to make health care decisions or are health care decisions going to be made by doctors and health care professionals?

   Mr. EDWARDS. That is absolutely correct. There is nothing that requires the independent reviewer to see the patient. You could have some doctor who is nothing but a bureaucrat, who has not seen the patient, does not know what the patient needs, making the decision. 
   If I could add one thing, another problem with this so-called independent review process is the HMO, the health insurance company, are the ones that are determining. Remember, they choose this entity that chooses the reviewer. They determine who is biased or unbiased.

   Mr. EDWARDS. They pay the reviewer. We have said it now five different times, but talk about putting the fox in charge of the chicken coop. What we need to be doing is to have some truly independent body making these determinations. They need to be able to make the determination based upon what the patient, in my example the child, really needs, based on what the doctor says the child needs.

   Mr. EDWARDS. You would have absolutely no opportunity and no opportunity to have the decision reversed. I might add, there is a double whammy in this amendment. The double whammy is that the only thing that can be appealed is the determination of what is medically necessary, and what is medically necessary, under the language of their bill is--and I am reading now from the bill--``when medically necessary and appropriate under the terms and conditions of the plan,'' which is what the HMO and the health insurance company's contract says. 
   People are getting whammied twice: No. 1, you cannot appeal but one thing, which is: Is it medically necessary? No. 2, that determination is based on what the health insurance company or the HMO wrote into the plan.

   Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, I say respectfully in response to my colleague from Oklahoma that there are two things about which I fundamentally disagree with him. No. 1, under our proposal, the State--totally independent--chooses the reviewing body. If my colleagues are really looking for an independent review, I ask them whether they would agree to allow the State to choose the reviewing body instead of the health insurance company, instead of the HMO choosing the entity that chooses the reviewing body. I cannot imagine how they would disagree  with that if they are looking for a truly independent review. 
   Secondly, the entire issue revolves around what is medical necessity. I say to my colleagues, would they agree to change the language of this amendment so that the initial decision and every appeals decision of the appeals deciding body is not bound by the definition of ``medical necessity'' contained in the insurance written contract? Because so long as the appeals process is controlled by what the HMO wrote, what the health insurance company wrote at the beginning and all the way through the process, the patient does not have a chance. They will never have a chance. My question is to my colleagues----

   Mr. EDWARDS. I will give the Senator an opportunity to respond. My question is whether they will agree, No. 1, with the State choosing a truly independent reviewing body, and, No. 2, whether they will agree that the reviewing body is not bound by a definition written by the health insurance or HMO company. 
   I yield for a question.

<DOCNO>106-edwards-nc-16-19990713</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. EDWARDS. My response is very simple. 
   The language on the preceding page requires that the independent external review entity be designated by the State. That is, if I am reading the language correctly, contained on the preceding page. That is designated by the State. In fact, we say--this is at page 11, I say to the Senator--that ``No party to the dispute shall be permitted to select the entity conducting the review.'' 
   So there are two things operating, I think, in combination in our bill. No. 1, the State has to designate an independent body, and, No. 2, we specifically require that no party to the dispute be involved in designating the reviewing entity. 
   I might add to that, I think it is also critically important who determines what is medically necessary and what the appeal decision body is bound by in terms of what is medically necessary because I think all of this becomes meaningless if they are bound by what the HMO or health insurance company wrote.

   Mr. EDWARDS. I thank the Chair. 
   Mr. President, I will briefly respond to the remarks by Senator COLLINS from Maine, for whom I have tremendous respect. She and I have worked together on a number of issues. I know she believes deeply in the cause she advocates this afternoon. I have great professional and personal respect for her. This is an issue on which I happen to disagree with her for a number of reasons. 
   First, she suggests their plan--the plan she is referring to I assume is the Republican plan--is one that adequately protects patients' rights because of laws enacted in States across the country. If that is so, why is there such an enormous public outcry for reform? The American people believe deeply that patient protection legislation is desperately needed across this country. If these laws already exist and are already in place and are working, why in the world does anybody need to do anything? The reality is that these laws are not in place and they are not working. Let me give a few examples. 
   For example, access to clinical trials, which is a critical component of our bill: 47 States of the 50 have no provision for access to clinical trials. 
   External appeals, which are absolutely essential: 32 States have no provision for independent external appeals. 
   Access to specialists: 39 States have no provision allowing people to designate a specialist as their primary care provider, and 36 States have no provision for standing referrals to specialists. 
   Continuity of care: 30 States have no continuity of care provisions. 
   This list goes on and on. 
   The reality is, No. 1, that the majority of States have none of the protections we are talking about in the Democratic Patients' Bill of Rights. That is the reason there is an enormous public outcry. That is the reason we have a health care crisis in this country today, and it is the reason I respectfully disagree with my colleague, the Senator from Maine. 
   The second reason is, to the extent a State has passed any kind of patient protection legislation and that legislation conflicts in any way with ERISA, it is preempted. It is absolutely preempted, under existing law, if we never pass anything. Even the laws that have been passed, to the extent those laws conflict in any way with the existing ERISA statutes, are preempted by ERISA. 
   The bottom line is this: No. 1, if State laws adequately dealt with this problem, we would not have the public outcry, the horror stories which we have heard and will continue to hear in this Senate over the course of the next week. 
   No. 2, the fact of the matter is, to the extent those laws exist--and they do not exist in the majority of States on the critical issues--to the extent they do exist, they are preempted by ERISA. 
   I do want to mention one other thing on the issue of cost because there has been a lot of discussion about cost from the Senator from Oklahoma and the Senator from Maine. 
   First of all, it is critically important to recognize that to the extent we get a patient to a specialist soon, and we do that in our bill, 
   to the extent we allow women to go directly to an OB/GYN as their primary care provider, to the extent we allow patients who are in a critical emergency to go the nearest hospital and be seen by an emergency room department or physician and thereby save that patient's life or reduce the amount of long-term care that patient receives--in every one of those instances we are reducing long-term health care costs in this country. 
   So I want us to recognize, first, that to the extent we are talking about increased costs, they are only talking about short-term costs, not long-term costs. The truth of the matter is that long-term costs will be reduced by passage of the Patients' Bill of Rights for the very same reason that preventive medicine reduces health care costs in this country, because we are going to get folks to the doctor they need to see sooner; they are going to get the care they need quicker. 
   The net result of that is that they do not need the ongoing, chronic, long-term care that many patients, unfortunately, have to get because they do not see the physician they need to see as quickly as they need to see them. That is what the external review process does. That is what the internal review process does. 
   I might add, those two things work in concert with the fact that, under our bill, an HMO can be held accountable in court for what they do. I want the American people to recognize what happens when an HMO cannot be held accountable, when they are treated as a privileged entity. And under existing law they are a privileged entity. They, among all the businesses and corporations and individuals in this country, get special treatment, treatment that none of our families or our children or our small businesses get. They are all held completely responsible. But HMOs, for some reason, are above the rest of us. They are a cut above the rest of us. They get special treatment. They cannot be held accountable in court. 
   So what happens when an HMO makes an arbitrary and capricious decision and a child suffers a serious injury as a result and has a lifetime of medical care in front of them--for example, a 7-year-old child? If the HMO can be held responsible, the HMO bears that cost, as well they should bear that cost because they are responsible for it. 
   But what happens if the HMO does not bear the cost? We know where the cost goes. It goes to us. It goes to the American taxpayer. Because those kids do not have the money to pay for chronic, long-term care over the course of their lives. They are paid out of Medicaid. They are paid with taxpayer dollars. The net result of that is that the cost an HMO or a health insurance company would bear has been shifted to the American taxpayer. That is wrong. We know it is wrong. That is one of the things we are trying to do something about in this bill. 
   I have to add one other thing. The Senator from Oklahoma said over and over during the course of his argument that what our bill proposes is that the Government knows the answer, that the Government has the solution. My response to that, with all due respect, is existing law and the bill of the other side would say the HMO has the answer, the health insurance company has the answer. 
   I say to the American people, and to my colleagues, we have tried that. We have tried leaving this in the hands of the HMO. We have tried leaving it in the hands of the health insurance industry. And it has not worked. 
   With that, I conclude by saying I think it is critically important that we cover all Americans, that all Americans are covered by health insurance plans. That is done under the Democratic bill.

   Mr. EDWARDS. Thank you, Mr. President. 
   Let me say, first, that there are two very important reasons that this has been an extraordinarily difficult issue for me. The first of those reasons is that I have extraordinary respect for the Senator from Arizona, the Senator from Connecticut, and the Senator from Oregon. They are friends of mine. They are good Americans. They are good people. They care about this country. They care about it deeply. I don't question their motives for one moment. I believe they are doing what they think is right. 
   The second reason is that I began this process myself desperately wanting to support some kind of Y2K bill. 
   The problem with the way the debate has been conducted is that the focus of my colleagues from Oregon, from Arizona, and from Connecticut has been on things we all agree on. We all agree--speaking for myself--that we should create incentives for computer companies to solve these problems, that we should create incentives for people who buy computers to work with those folks to solve problems, and to mitigate whatever damage or loss they may sustain. 
   We all believe there ought to be a cooling-off period. At least I believe there should be a cooling-off period. I do not think we want folks rushing to the courthouse the first time a problem rears its ugly head. I think we should have reasonable, thoughtful alternative dispute resolution. 
   I think all of those things are good things. They are laudable. They accomplish important goals. They are things I support and believe in. On those subjects, and on the subject of preventing frivolous litigation, I am totally in agreement with my colleagues who support this bill. 
   The problem is, we are not focusing on the single, most fundamental problem in this bill, which is that in 99 percent of the cases small businesses and consumers who suffer losses as a result of an irresponsible act by a computer company in respect to Y2K can recover nothing but the cost of their computer. They can't recover their lost wages. They can't recover their actual lost profit. They can't recover their overhead. If they are run out of business, they are just stuck. 
   Unfortunately, what we have here is what I am afraid happens too often in Washington. The little guy loses, and the big guy wins. 
   There is no question that the computer industry has a powerful voice in this body. The people who are going to be damaged and hurt by this bill don't even know it yet. They largely are completely unaware of it. The small business men and women of this country and consumers in small towns all over North Carolina and across the United States don't even know that they are going to suffer losses, that they are going to be put out of business. They do not know that. My question to my colleague is, Who speaks for them? 
   We have heard the voices loudly, clearly, powerfully, and articulately for powerful, big business. There are many things I will support industry on that I believe are in the best interests of America. The problem is, the people who are going to be injured by this bill, the people who are going to be put out of business, the people who by all accounts--my colleagues from Oregon and Connecticut have just conceded--will have real and legitimate losses, who speaks for them? I am afraid the answer is that no one speaks for them. They don't give big money to campaigns. They don't even know what is going to happen to them yet. They are out there and are innocent victims. Who is the voice for the little guy in this debate? 
   These losses we have talked about--I am eliminating frivolous lawsuits, I am eliminating causes that ought to be resolved, things that ought to be resolved by discussion between the seller and the buyer, all of those things that we are all in agreement on--I am talking about that little business guy or woman in Murfreesboro, NC, who bought a computer believing that it was Y2K compliant, having been told that it is Y2K compliant, and the computer is not Y2K compliant. 
   They lose their business. They have lost thousands and thousands of dollars, and they are literally out of business. 
   That loss--no matter what we do in this Senate, no matter what we do in this Congress, and, with respect, no matter what the President signs in the Oval Office--that loss will not go away. It will be there, and it will not disappear. 
   There is a fundamental concept we all have to recognize when we come to the well later today to vote. Those who vote for this bill have made a conscious decision. As long as we are willing to recognize that decision, I will respect the vote. That decision is this: We have made a conscious decision that losses --which are real and legitimate, out-of-pocket losses suffered by small business men and women all over this country--that losses are going to be shifted. We are going to move them from the responsible party to the innocent party. In this case, the innocent party is a small business; is a consumer; is somebody who cannot pay their employees anymore; is somebody who has no cash-flow because their manufacturing operation has been shut down because of a Y2K problem. 
   The bottom line is this: We are making a judgment on the floor of the Senate that those real and legitimate losses which everyone concedes are going to occur--that is the ``nut'' of this. Everything else we agree on. I agree with my colleagues about eliminating frivolous lawsuits, about alternative dispute resolution, about cooling off periods, about trying to do everything in our power to solve these problems. The nut of this problem is, what happens to the little guy who suffers a real loss? 
   When this conference report passes on the floor of the Senate later tonight, we have made the judgment that we will shift that loss. We are going to shift it on to the people who have no voice, who don't even know they are victims. They are not sitting in our offices. They are not sitting there because they don't know they have been hurt yet. We are going to shift the loss to them. We are going to make sure it stays right with them. We are going to make sure that multimillion-dollar and multibillion-dollar businesses bear as little of that loss as possible. That is exactly what this bill does. It is that simple. 
   For all of the rhetoric on the floor, it is not about lawyers. It is about the people who make computers. It is about the people who make computer chips. It is about the people who buy computers. Those are the parties to this transaction. 
   The bill that came back from conference is worse than the bill that went to conference. It is worse for a very simple and fundamental reason: It creates multiple additional roadblocks to innocent people who get hurt by the Y2K problem. A job that was already extraordinarily difficult, for them to recover for what happened to them, has become almost impossible at this point. 
   I say with complete respect to my colleagues who have argued vehemently on the floor that this is a 3-year bill, that it will sunset in 3 years, and for that reason it is not bad, that the argument is a smokescreen. Every Y2K problem that will come into existence will happen during that 3-year period--99 percent. By its very nature this problem will show its ugly head in  the year 2000 or the year 2001. Essentially, we are going to cover every single Y2K problem that can come into existence. 
   One bit of language that has been referred to in the bill that proponents claim helps improve this report over the Senate-passed version has to do with the issue of recovery of economic losses such as lost profits, lost overhead, lost income. A phrase reads: ``A party to a Y2K action making a tort claim other than a claim of intentional tort''--up until then it is fine--``arising independent of a contract.'' 
   I have spent the last 20 years of my life as a practicing lawyer. This is what that phrase means. If a computer person walks into a small business anywhere in this country and makes a fraudulent misrepresentation, intentionally misrepresents the Y2K 
   compliance of their product, lies, commits criminal fraud, and induces somebody to sign a contract on that basis, and in fact, if the contract itself contains fraudulent misrepresentations, what that person can recover is the cost of their computer. 
   They are victims of criminal fraud. I want the American people to hear this. They are the victims of criminal fraud. What they can get back is the cost of their computer. 
   This bill started with a good purpose. It is supported by Members of the Senate whom I have extraordinary respect for. I absolutely have no question about their motives. They are doing what they believe is right. They have made beautiful cases for it on the floor of the Senate. My concern has been and continues to be that there is a voice that is not being heard on the floor of the Senate. It is the voice of the victims; it is the voice of the consumers; it is the voice of the people who don't know yet that they are going to be put out of business. It is the voice of people who don't know yet that they have been lied to or misrepresented to, been induced to sign a contract under the specific language of this bill. 
   As a result of this bill, they can recover absolutely nothing but the cost of their computer. 
   It is wrong. It violates every concept of justice that exists in the United States and has existed for the last 200 years. 
   We can do the things that my colleagues want to do: Get rid of frivolous lawsuits, induce people to solve these problems, get people to work together, not go into court. We can do all those things, and we can accomplish those things. But we can do it without gutting the right of the little guy who has a real and legitimate claim and has suffered a tremendous loss, been put out of business, without taking away that very fundamental right. 
   Those people are going to be sitting in our offices. So I have one last question to my colleagues: When those men and women are sitting in your offices in February, March, and April of the year 2000, saying: I have been put out of business, who do I go see? Who do I go see about this? I am out of business. Computer people made fraudulent misrepresentations in my contract. They were reckless in the way they made their product. I never knew it. I am out of business. 
   They are sitting on our couch in our offices, and they look in our eyes and say: Who do I go see about this problem? Maybe some of my colleagues have an answer to that question. Unfortunately, I do not. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. EDWARDS. I wonder if the Senator has the same perception I do, being from the State of North Carolina. The Senator and I both know that agriculture and our family farmers are in desperate crisis, and they need help in the worst kind of way. He and I are committed to help them. I know that. I have heard him talk about that subject in this Chamber. I feel very strongly about that. 
   My question is about this Patients' Bill of Rights issue. It seems to me what we have--there has been a lot of discussion about the Democratic version and the Republican version--is an 
   insurance company bill, on the one hand, and a patients' and doctors' bill on the other hand. Will the Senator agree with that?

   Mr. EDWARDS. We discussed it briefly a moment ago, and that is the fact that doctors are finding it necessary to unionize or to make an effort to unionize because they are no longer able to prescribe the treatments and tests for their patients they know their patients need, in fact because they are not able to make determinations about what is medically necessary, whether a child--if the Senator would hold this photograph up one more time--whether such a child medically needs the surgical procedure the Senator talked about in the last few minutes, the fact that doctors find it necessary to unionize in order to do what they have spent their entire lives being trained to do, which is to provide the best possible medical care to their patients. Can the Senator imagine a more powerful indication and symptom of the medical crisis confronting this country today?

   Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, I rise today to note with sadness the death this morning of the Chancellor of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Michael Hooker. 
   Chancellor Hooker was a friend and someone whom I have known for a number of years. He was a man of vision, enthusiasm, energy, brilliance, and he had an extraordinary love for the State of North Carolina. 
   His passing is not only a loss for those of us in the University of North Carolina family, but for all North Carolinians. By making a great university better, Michael Hooker made a lasting contribution to our entire State. 
   The truth is that his death was both a shock and a blow. Just yesterday he was at work in Chapel Hill. 
   He was diagnosed this year with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and had been undergoing treatments at the National Cancer Institute in Maryland and also at the UNC Hospitals. 
   While he was up here, I had the pleasure of seeing him a few times. Not too long ago, I ran into him and his wonderful wife Carmen, who is an extraordinary woman, right outside the Senate Chamber. He looked well and was feeling optimistic at that time about his health. He did take a brief leave from his job for treatment of the disease, but for most of the year, he was hard at work. 
   I cannot say how sad I felt to learn this morning the news that his cancer had grown worse and that it took him at an early age--at the age of 53. My thoughts and prayers go out to Carmen, his wonderful wife, and to their children.  
   Let me tell you, Mr. President, just a little more about Chancellor Hooker and what he has done for my State of North Carolina. 
   He was the first person in his family to get a college degree--a philosophy degree from Chapel Hill in 1969. His father was a coal miner. He always credited his parents' belief in hard work and good education for his own success. 
   After graduation, he left North Carolina to get a graduate degree and to enter the world of academics. He taught philosophy at Harvard. He was president of Bennington College and also president of the University of Massachusetts system. He was president of the University of Maryland at Baltimore County. 
   He returned to North Carolina in July of 1995 to become UNC's eighth chancellor. And he really attacked the job. One year he visited every single county in North Carolina--and we have 100 counties in North Carolina--to make sure that every person in the State knew they were connected with their university. Then he made sure that the faculty and administration at UNC were connected to the State. He once took the new faculty and administrators from other States on a week-long bus tour of North Carolina. 
   The truth of the matter is that men like Michael Hooker have long lists of accomplishments. They serve on many blue ribbon panels; they get lots of honorary degrees; they write great scholarly pieces; they are placed on many ``best of'' lists. I could go through a great deal of these with respect to Chancellor Hooker, because he accomplished all of those things. 
   But in the end, I think Michael Hooker himself valued people most. I believe he would like to be remembered for all of the things he did to make people's lives better. He understood the need for education, not only because it expands men's and women's minds but because it makes our society better, stronger, more prosperous, and more equitable. He was an extraordinary and wonderful man. 
   He said it best himself, if I could just quote him:  
   There is only one reason to have a public university, and that is to serve the people of the state. That should be the touchstone of everything we do: whether it's in the interest of North Carolina and our citizens. Our litmus test is the question: Is what we do in Chapel Hill helping the factory worker in Kannapolis?  
   The best tribute we can give him is all the good works performed in the future by those who were touched by him and his life. Chancellor Hooker was an extraordinary man. He will be missed by me, he will be missed by every single citizen in North Carolina, and he will be missed by all those who knew him. 
   With that, I yield the floor, Mr. President. 
   Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.

   Mr. EDWARDS. With respect to the instance described by our distinguished colleague, the Senator from Illinois, where obviously a catheterization would have saved this patient's life, will the Senator from California explain to the American public and to our colleagues, No. 1, when they decided initially, no, we are not going to pay for the care, and, therefore, they could not get the test done, and a lot of life-saving tests that needed to be done, what avenue or recourse does that patient have? Is there anything they can do under the circumstances under existing law if we don't pass a real Patients' Bill of Rights?

   Mr. EDWARDS. If the Senator will yield for one other question, with respect to what my distinguished colleague from Illinois just pointed out, it is my understanding that under existing law we have this very privileged group of insurance companies--very wealthy insurance companies--that are singled out in American life as not being held accountable for what they do. You and I can be held accountable.  Everybody in our State of North Carolina, and Illinois, New York, and California, can be held accountable. Every other business, small and large, can be held accountable. But the health insurance industry is special. It is different. It is better than the rest of us. It can't be held responsible. 
   I want to know how the Senator from California would respond to a family, or to our children who we are trying on a daily basis to teach about personal responsibility, personal accountability, something that all of us believe in deeply, how do we explain that we have singled out this very well-to-do industry for privileged treatment, and, in fact, unlike our children, unlike our families, we are not going to hold them responsible or accountable?

   Mr. EDWARDS. Units. Not human beings but units. 
   Under existing law, health insurance companies have proven time and time again they are motivated by one thing, and that one thing is the dollar bill. Profit is the bottom line. 
   We have talked about doing two things in a patients' bill--not in an insurance industry bill. Since money seems to be what motivates these folks, we will do two things. 
   No. 1, as the distinguished Senator from New York mentioned, we will create an independent body that can oversee the insurance industry, the HMO. When they make arbitrary decisions, when they decide even though it is clear a patient or child desperately needs a treatment or a test and that was an arbitrary decision, they can get a quick reversal from that truly independent board. That is one thing. 
   In addition to that, we also say health insurance companies and HMOs, as every other segment of American society, will be treated the same. They can be held accountable. They can be held responsible. They can be held responsible in a court of law. 
   Those two things together--a truly independent review, done swiftly so reversals can occur, combined and working in concert with arbitrary, money-driven decisions where if some child is severely injured as a result, they can be held accountable. 
   I wonder if the distinguished Senator would comment on whether she believes those two things, working together, create a tremendous incentive that does not presently exist for HMOs and health insurance companies to do the right thing to start with, so we never get to an independent review board, we never get to a court of law; instead, insurance companies and HMOs are doing the right thing, not making arbitrary decisions, doing what the treating doctors are advising needs to be done in the very first instance when it is most important and could do the most good.

   Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, I rise today to acknowledge the election of Ehud Barak to Prime Minister of Israel and his efforts to form a new government. I congratulate him, not only on his most impressive victory, but also for his commitment to reinvigorate the Middle East peace process. As Mr. Barak enters the critical stage in his efforts to forge a coalition government, I wish him luck. And I applaud his initial steps of talking with Egyptian President Mubarak and declaring his intent to form a ``peace administration'' of three negotiating teams, one each for Syria, Lebanon and the Palestinians, reporting directly to him. We must not risk losing momentum toward achieving a lasting peace. 
   As Israel continues to take risks for peace, it is all the more important that America's commitment toward Israel be unquestioned. Our strong commitment helps Israel take risks and makes it clear to Israel's neighbors that Israel is a permanent reality that must be dealt with directly. Our dedication to Israel must take many shapes. We must continue aid to Israel. We must help Israel militarily. We must actively support the peace process. We must maintain our support for Jerusalem as Israel's capital. 
   America's support for the peace process, for the security of this region, and for Israel itself must be unwavering. Israel, the only pluralistic democracy in the Middle East, deserves our continued strong support. Helping Israel survive and thrive is the right thing to do. In a particularly volatile part of the world, Israel is strategically important to America's interests. We cannot help but benefit by strengthened economic, political, military and cultural ties with Israel. 
   I have the greatest respect for Israel, its citizens, and its founders. The creation of the state of Israel is a remarkable story of a great people who overcame the Holocaust, rebuffed repeated foreign hostility, and created an industrialized democracy in a desert. The story of Israel appeals to me because it is a story of faith and it is a story of justice. I respect all who stand up to powerful forces against great odds for a just cause. 
   No issue is more important to our relationship than aid to Israel. It is one of America's most cost-effective foreign policy investments. The economic and military aid that America provides Israel serves the interests of both countries by promoting peace, security, and trade. Israel recently initiated an agreement with the United States under which the United States will gradually reduce the amount of economic aid in the coming years while ensuring an adequate amount of military assistance. I commend Israel for this initiative, and I believe that the United States should stand by it. 
   The Middle East's unstable mixture of unconventional weaponry, advanced military technology, political instability, and radical fundamentalism  threatens both Israel's security and America's vital interests in the region and around the world. I am committed to the expansion of the United States-Israel strategic cooperation that was formalized in 1983. 
   In addition, it is our national interest to help ensure that Israel maintains her qualitative military edge. Furthermore, the Unites States should not sell sophisticated weaponry that could erode that edge to nations hostile toward Israel. And, of course, the United States must do all it can to stop the development or acquisition of nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons by rogue states such as Libya, Iraq and Iran. 
   True and lasting peace between Israel and her neighbors can be achieved only through direct negotiations between the parties. Nevertheless, the United States has played a critical role with Israel and her neighbors in helping bridge the differences between them. We must continue to invest the time and energy necessary to help continue this very complex series of negotiations. 
   Israel's capital of Jerusalem is important to Jews, Christian, and Muslims. I commend Israel for allowing all three faiths open access to worship at their holy places. Jerusalem is and ought to remain a united city under Israeli sovereignty. 
   Israel is the only country where the United States chooses not to locate our embassy in that country's capital city. I support the Jerusalem Embassy Act that recognizes the united city of Jerusalem as Israel's capital and mandates the moving of our embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. 
   Finally, I want to discuss Israel's special relationship with my home state of North Carolina. Since 1993, North Carolina and Israel have had one of the most comprehensive official exchange programs in the country. Both North Carolina and Israel have economies that depend on high technology, agriculture, and education. Both states benefit from their ongoing economic, social, and cultural exchanges. I look forward to doing all I can to promote this valuable relationship between Israel and the great state of North Carolina. 
   Mr. President, I look forward to working with Israel's soon-to-be formed government to pursue our nations' many mutual interests. I wish Mr. Barak and his government the best as he pursues peace, security, and prosperity in the twenty-first century.

   Mr. EDWARDS. I thank the Chair. 
   Mr. President, I appreciated and enjoyed the remarks of my distinguished colleague from New Jersey. I come again to the Senate Chamber to talk about what I believe is a crisis in America today, which is the issue of health care and the desperate need for a Patients' Bill of Rights. 
   If we need more glaring evidence of that, all any American needs to do today is open the front page of their newspaper and find that the American Medical Association is supporting doctors being allowed to form unions. Nothing can better exemplify the crisis with which we are confronted. 
   Here are medical professionals, the last group anyone would imagine, forming a union or finding the need to form a union, who now find, in order to do what they believe is right--to make medical decisions about the patients they care so much about, to be allowed the autonomy to make those decisions and not have those decisions made by health insurance bureaucrats sitting behind a computer screen or a desk somewhere--it necessary to talk about the need to form unions. 
   I listened to my colleague from California earlier this morning. I agree with everything she said. Only the most skeptical of us would have ever thought this was a possibility. The root cause for the doctors' need to form a union is that they want to make medical decisions about the care of their patients and, more specifically, they want to decide when a procedure is medically necessary and when a procedure is not. 
   If I can use two examples which I think glaringly show the problem doctors in this country and patients are confronted with today, they are two I have mentioned before on the floor of the Senate. One involves a young man named Ethan Bedrick who developed cerebral palsy as a young child. One of the problems associated with cerebral palsy is the development of what is called muscle contractures. We have all seen adults with cerebral palsy who are all balled up, their arms held up against their bodies. They have little or no control over their limbs. The reason that happens is because, as children and as young adults, these patients do not receive physical therapy to extend their limbs on a regular basis to give them their best use. 
   What happened with Ethan Bedrick is every single doctor who was treating him for his cerebral palsy--and there were myriad doctors--said it was absolutely essential he receive physical therapy. This was a group of doctors who had seen him every day and was responsible for his care. 
   Then some insurance company doctor, sitting behind the desk looking at a piece of paper, who had never seen Ethan Bedrick, never examined him and, I will add, unlike all the doctors who were treating him, had absolutely no expertise in treating kids with cerebral palsy or the issue of physical therapy for those kids, made the decision this was not medically necessary. Therefore, the insurance company decided it was not going to pay for any physical therapy for this boy. 
   After some 2 odd years of going to court and going through a lot of litigation procedures which absolutely should never have been necessary, the U.S. Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals determined the obvious, which is that the treating doctors were correct, that Ethan desperately needed this physical therapy for the purpose of keeping him from becoming like so many adults with cerebral palsy who we have seen all 
   balled up and unable to control their limbs in any way. 
   They reversed the insurance company decision and said they had to provide this treatment. It took over a year after that decision before the insurance company actually began to do something. 
   It is a perfect example of insurance company bureaucrats and accountants making health care decisions. That is the reason doctors feel the need to unionize, so they can make these decisions instead of insurance companies. 
   A second example is a man named Steve Grissom from Cary, NC, who developed leukemia as a young man. As a result of his leukemia, he had a blood transfusion. During the course of his blood transfusion, he acquired AIDS. He became sicker and sicker with his AIDS to the point a pulmonary specialist, a leading authority in the world at Duke University Medical Center, prescribed oxygen for him 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. 
   What happened was during the time he was being treated, his HMO was providing coverage for him because the pulmonary specialist, the real expert, determined it was necessary. Then his employer changed HMOs. The new HMO--again with some person sitting behind a desk somewhere, not a medical doctor--decided based on a chart that he did not quite meet the numbers for oxygen saturation that were necessary and, therefore, cut off all coverage for the oxygen that his world-renowned specialist had ordered for him. 
   Now Steve is working desperately--in fact, he is coming to Washington this week to see me and other Senators--to pay for the oxygen that keeps him alive. It is one of the reasons he is alive and able to be with his family, which he loves and cherishes so much. 
   These are terrific examples of what is fundamentally wrong with our health care system in this country today. The judgments of what is medically necessary have to be made by people who are trained to do it. They have to be made by doctors who are seeing the patients, who have the clinical judgment to make those determinations.  
   It is critically important for our doctors to do their job. It is critically important for the children, adults, and families they treat. In our Patients' Bill of Rights, we specifically provide that doctors make those decisions. Our opponents' bill does not do that, and that is why the bills are so dramatically different. 
   One last thing I want to mention is the issue of financial incentives that are sometimes created in HMO contracts either explicitly or implicitly. I know specifically of an example in North Carolina where a mother was in labor. The doctor who was responsible for taking care of her had too many patients to care for. As a result of complications during labor, she needed her doctor. The nurse called for the doctor. The doctor did not come. She did not understand why. 
   The reason was the doctor had other patients he could not leave. Instead of calling for a backup, the doctor continued to allow this woman to labor with her complications without a doctor by her bedside. 
   The result of this was a child born severely brain injured. We later learned the reason this is done, the reason no backup doctor is called is because there is enormous pressure, financial and otherwise, put on these physicians by the HMO, by the health insurance company, not to call a backup doctor because it costs them money. It costs the health insurance company and the HMO money, 
   and, further, that they can actually receive bonuses if they prescribe the least expensive treatment for patients, no matter what the patient needs, and if they fail to call backup doctors even though one may be needed. In other words, the HMOs have been putting doctors in the position of having to provide the cheapest treatment, not call other medical personnel who are necessary, solely so they could save a dollar. 
   These things are what are fundamentally wrong with the way health care is being conducted in this country today. There is a fundamental difference between our bill and our opponents' bill. Our bill specifically provides that these kinds of financial incentives are absolutely prohibited; they cannot occur. Our opponents' bill is silent on that issue. 
   We cannot continue to allow the American people to be subjected to this. It is the reason we have this crisis. It has gotten to crisis proportions because we have gone this long and done nothing about it. Medical care should be about patients and not about profits. 
   I say this, in a most nonpartisan way, to my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, for whom I have tremendous respect and who I know want to do the right thing for the people they represent and the American people. 
   This is not a partisan issue for me. It was an important issue to me in being elected to the Senate. It is an issue I want to talk about while I am here. But I want to talk about it in an ongoing, meaningful dialogue. I am not interested in fighting about it. I am not interested in political bickering. What I am really interested in is what is done in the best interests of the people of North Carolina and what is in the best interests of the people of America. 
   With that, I yield the floor.

   Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, I come to the floor to address the important issue of the Patients' Bill of Rights. I will respond briefly to a couple of issues raised by my colleague, the distinguished Senator from Oklahoma, when the bulk of his argument and response to our Patients' Bill of Rights has to do with the issue of cost. 
   I just want to point out that the most reliable studies done by the GAO indicate that the increased costs across America will be somewhere between $1 and $2 per patient per month, which I think is less than a cup of Starbuck's coffee. My suspicion is that most Americans would be willing to bear that cost to have real and meaningful health care reform. 
   There is a lot of rhetoric about national health insurance, and they are not for that. This bill has absolutely nothing to do with national health insurance. What it has to do with is creating rights for patients that provide them with protections against HMOs and health insurance companies that are taking advantage of them on a daily basis. 
   There is another huge difference between these two bills. I prefer not to talk about them as the Democratic or Republican bill because, for me at least, this is not a partisan issue; it is a substantive issue. If we have a bill that is a real, meaningful Patients' Bill of Rights, whether it is Democratic or Republican, or a compromise between the two, I would support it. It makes no difference to me who authors the bill. I came here to talk about an issue that is critical to the people of North Carolina, to the people of America. 
   The people of America are not interested in partisan bickering on the floor of the Senate. They are not interested in that; they don't care about it. What they do care about, and what I care about, is addressing the issue of health care and the issue of the Patients' Bill of Rights in a real substantive and meaningful way. 
   I want to talk briefly, if I can, about a real case I was involved in personally--at least my law firm was involved in--before I came to the Senate this past January. The case involved a young man named Ethan Bedrick. Ethan was born with cerebral palsy. As a result of his cerebral palsy, he needed a multitude of medical treatments, including therapists--physical and speech--to help him with mouth movement and his limbs. The physical therapy was prescribed specifically for the purpose of being able to pull his limbs out and back and out and back, so he didn't develop what is called muscle contractures, so that he didn't get in a condition where he could not move his arms and legs any longer. 
   Ethan is from Charlotte, NC. Ethan's doctors who were seeing him--a multitude of doctors, including physical therapists, a general practice physician, a pediatric neurologist who specialized in making determinations about what children in his condition needed--all of those physicians, every single one of them, everybody treating him came to the conclusion that Ethan needed physical therapy. 
   When the family went to their health insurance company to try to get reimbursed for the physical therapy, the health insurance company denied paying for the physical therapy. Basically, they decided it based upon an extraordinarily limited and arbitrary reading of the term ``medical necessity.'' They basically found the most limited definition and they looked around and found a doctor who was willing to support that position. So they denied the claims. 
   I want the American people to understand that every doctor who was treating Ethan said he needed this care. It was absolutely standard care for a young child with cerebral palsy. But there was some doctor working for an insurance company somewhere in America who was willing to say: No, I don't think he needs it. Therefore, they denied coverage, regardless of 
   what all his treating physicians said. 
   We filed a lawsuit on behalf of Ethan against the insurance company. We had to jump through extraordinary hoops because it is so difficult to bring any kind of action against a health insurance company or an HMO. The case was decided, ultimately, by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, which covers a number of States in the southeastern United States. That court, which is well known for its conservative nature, issued an opinion on Ethan's case. I will quote very briefly from that opinion. The court addressed in very stark terms what they saw as the problem. I am reading now from the opinion of the Fourth Circuit:  
   ..... The precipitous decision to give up on Ethan was made by Dr. Pollack, who could provide scant support for it. The insurance company boldly states that she [Dr. Pollack] has a ``wealth of experience in pediatrics and knowledge of cerebral palsy in children.'' We see nothing [in the Record] to support this. ..... In fact, she was asked whether, in her twenty years of practice, she ever prescribed either speech therapy, occupational therapy, or physical therapy for her cerebral palsy patients. Her answer: ``No, because in the area where I practiced, the routine was to send children with cerebral palsy to the Kennedy Center and the Albert Einstein College of Medicine. We took care only of routine physical care. 
   So much for Dr. Pollack's ``wealth of experience.''  
   This was a physician who had absolutely no experience with prescribing physical therapy for children with cerebral palsy. Yet this physician was the sole basis for the insurance company denying this very needed care for this young boy with cerebral palsy. 
   It gets worse. Dr. Pollack was then asked whether physical therapy could prevent contractures, which is what is caused when children with cerebral palsy don't get this. Their arms and legs become contracted and they can't be pulled out. 
   This was her answer: No. 
   She was asked: Why not? 
   Answer: Because it is my belief that it is not an effective way of treating contractures. 
   This is the insurance company doctor. 
   She was asked: Where did this belief come from? 
   She says: I cannot tell you exactly how I developed it because the truth is I haven't thought about it for a long time. 
   The nadir of this testimony was reached soon thereafter because the baselessness for this insurance company doctor's decision became very apparent. The Fourth Circuit quotes from the questions and answers to Dr. Pollack:  
   Question: ..... If Dr. Lesser and Dr. Swetenburg were of the opinion that physical therapy at the rate and occupational  therapy at that rate were medically necessary for Ethan Bedrick, would you have any reason to oppose their opinion? 
   Answer: I am not sure I understand the question. Using what definition of medical necessity? 
   Question: Well, using the evaluation of medical necessity as what is in the best interests of the child, the patient. 
   Answer: I think we are talking about two different things. 
   Question: All right. Expand, explain to me what two different things we are talking about? 
   Answer: I'm speaking about what is to be covered by our contract. 
   Question: Is what is covered by your contract something that's different than the best interests of the child as far as medical treatment is concerned? 
   Answer: I find that's a little like ``have you stopped beating your wife?'' 
   Question: That's why I ask it. If Doctor Swetenburg and Dr. Lesser recommended physical therapy and occupational therapy at the rates prescribed, do you have any medical basis for why this is an inappropriate treatment that has been prescribed [for this boy]?  
   Remember, this is the insurance company doctor on the basis for which the insurance company had denied all coverage for this care.  
   Answer: I have no idea. I have not examined the patient. I have not determined whether it is appropriate or inappropriate. But that isn't a decision I was asked to make.  
   So what happened is, we have an insurance company doctor with no experience, never examined the child, who has decided this care is not medically necessary or medically appropriate, based on nothing and the insurance company denies coverage in the face of every single health care provider saying this child with cerebral palsy needs to be treated. 
   This is a perfect example of what is wrong with the system. It is why we need real external review. It is why we need an independent body that can look at a decision made by an insurance company and decide--it would be obvious in this case--that the decision was wrong and that a child is suffering as a result. 
   When I say an independent review, I mean a really independent review, not an independent review board made up of people chosen by the insurance company. That is an enormous difference between one of the bills being offered by our opponents and the bill being offered by us. We would set up a real and meaningful independent review board so that when something like this happens to Ethan Bedrick, a child with cerebral palsy, there would be a way to go to an independent board immediately and get a review, the result of which the decision would be reversed and in a matter of weeks, at the most, this child would get the therapy he so desperately needs. 
   The long and the short of it is, even after we won this case in the court of appeals, it was over a year before Ethan Bedrick began to receive the care he deserved. 
   This case illustrates perfectly why this is such an acute problem and why we need to address it. We need desperately to address it in a nonpartisan way. We need to do what is in the best interests of the American people; that is, to pass a real and meaningful Patients' Bill of Rights. 
   Thank you, Mr. President.

   Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Massachusetts. First, on this issue of the Patients' Bill of Rights, I ran for the Senate in part so I could address this issue, which is of critical importance to the people of North Carolina and the people of America, in a completely nonpartisan way. I am not interested in engaging in partisan politics between Democrats and Republicans. What I am interested in is a real discussion about an issue that is absolutely critically important to the people of this country and the people of North Carolina. Let me talk briefly about one aspect of the Patients' Bill of Rights that I think is so important. 
   Imagine there is a 29-year-old woman who lives in the Research Triangle of North Carolina which is between Raleigh-Durham and Chapel Hill, between Duke University Medical School and the University of North Carolina Medical School. Let's assume she is the mother of two children, having recently had a young child, born 6 months ago. She goes in for a postpartum checkup after the birth of her child, and the doctor looks at a mole on her back that seems suspicious. After some further testing, it is confirmed that her and her family's worst nightmare is true; she has a melanoma. 
   After they do further investigation, they determine there are clinical trials going on at Duke University Medical Center, just down the road from where she and her family live, which could provide lifesaving treatment for her condition. So she goes to her HMO and says: I want to be part of this; I want to make sure I have access to the best health care available. Literally, her life is as stake. She finds out from her HMO, unfortunately, that Duke is not part of the network of her HMO. So, as a result, treatment for her melanoma, which is so critically needed, is not available. 
   Here we have a situation where a simple thing is true. An HMO system, a health insurance system, a health insurance company, should not be able to stand between this woman and the lifesaving medical treatment she so badly needs and her family so badly needs for her. A real Patients' Bill of Rights would ensure that someone in her condition would have access to the best specialty care available, whether or not that care is within or without her HMO network. It would ensure, in my example, that she could, in fact, go 15 miles down the road to Duke University Medical Center and get the treatment that may well save her life--the life of a mother and a wife. 
   This is the kind of thing we need to be doing something about in the Patients' Bill of Rights. She should not be confronted with an obstacle course in order to get the treatment she needs and deserves. She needs to have ready, direct access to the care she obviously needs under these circumstances. 
   That was an illustration. 
   I want to talk, secondly, about a real-life example. We received a phone call in my office from a young man who lives in Cary, NC, which is just outside of Raleigh. His name is Steve Grissom. Fifteen years ago, Steve Grissom was diagnosed with leukemia. The truth is, for most people, that would be an extraordinary life-altering and devastating thing to have occur. Unfortunately, that is not the end of the problem for Steve Grissom. 
   In 1985, because of his leukemia, he was required to have a blood transfusion. Most folks who are listening to this story probably know where it is headed. As a result of this blood transfusion, which he had to get because of his leukemia, he now has AIDS. He got AIDS as a result of the blood transfusion. 
   With the onset of AIDS, he had multiple medical problems. Included among those medical problems was the development of something called pulmonary hypertension which made it very difficult for him to breathe. The doctors who treated him prescribed oxygen 24 hours a day, 7 days a week to help him maintain his oxygen level. This prescription was made by a pulmonary specialist at Duke University, something that was clearly needed to save his life. 
   He was doing fine. Then his employer changed health care companies, unbeknownst to him. When the new HMO took over, they cut off payment for the oxygen that Steve had been dependent on for a long time now--24 hours a day, 7 days a week. 
   Let me tell you how that decision was made. It was not made by some medical doctor who examined Steve and decided he did not need this treatment. It was not made by a specialist who had a different opinion than the pulmonary specialist at Duke University. Instead it was made by a clerical/bureaucratic person at the HMO sitting behind a desk looking at papers. The conclusion that person came to was that his oxygen saturation levels were not sufficiently low under their criteria to justify him receiving oxygen 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, even though the most highly trained medical specialist in the area at Duke University Hospital had prescribed this oxygen for him. He said it was lifesaving, absolutely critical. 
   The result of all this was basically an insurance company bureaucrat sitting behind a desk overrode a doctor who has spent his life in this area, who had become one of the best known pulmonary specialists in the country at Duke University, who had prescribed this oxygen therapy for Steve. Here is a man who has been confronted with extraordinary setbacks in his life, the kinds of things that would put most of us under the ground. 
   Here is the extraordinary thing about Steve Grissom. He has continued to fight. Even though his health insurance company now says they will not pay for the care he needs, he has managed to pay out of his own pocket for as much of this care as he can get. 
   He has called my office and said: I want to come to Washington. I want to testify. I want to talk to Members of  the Senate, Members of the Congress. I want to tell them about the problem I am having getting any continuity of care which I so desperately need. 
   The truth of the matter is, what Steve Grissom is doing is he is fighting in every way he knows how to cease being a statistic, to stop being a name and a number on a piece of paper on somebody's desk sitting in an insurance company office. 
   He is an extraordinary example of heroism. He is the kind of person whom I think most of us would hold up to our children and members of our family as what we hope they will be when confronted with extraordinary, difficult setbacks. 
   He fought back. He got the blood transfusion he needed in 1985. When he was then confronted with something that would absolutely overcome most people, which is AIDS as a result of the blood transfusion, he continued to do everything in his power to 
   get the treatment he needed and go forward with his life. 
   When he was on oxygen 24 hours a day, 7 days a week just to stay alive and his employer changed HMOs and they cut off payment for the treatment that kept him alive, he continued to fight. Here is the most extraordinary thing about it. Not only has he continued to fight, not only has he expressed a willingness to come and talk to Members of the Senate, to testify before this Congress about what he has been confronted with, there is absolutely no bitterness in this man. He has been kind and gracious. He has said: I want to do everything I can to ensure that what has happened to me does not happen to other Americans, does not happen to other North Carolinians. I want to explain to Members of Congress why it is so critically important that we pass a meaningful Patients' Bill of Rights, one that will protect people who are confronted with the kind of situation with which I am confronted. 
   The truth of the matter is, it is extraordinary that he is still alive. He continues to be a huge part of his family's life. He is, by any measure, a hero. But to the insurance company, Steve Grissom is a liability. He is somebody who costs $515 a month to pay for the oxygen that is needed to keep him alive. 
   The reality is that they made the decision about Steve Grissom for the same reason that HMOs and health insurance companies make these decisions all across the country, affecting children and adults and families all over this country every day. They did it based on the bottom line--profits. They had established an arbitrary criteria for what was necessary for somebody in Steve's situation to get oxygen therapy and treatment that he needed. Regardless of his individual situation, regardless of the fact that the doctors who were responsible for treating him, who are highly trained, highly specialized experts at Duke University Medical Center, had said he needs this treatment, they rejected it. They made the decision that no longer would he receive this oxygen, and they would not pay for it anymore. 
   I cannot help but believe the majority of Americans think that what has been done to Steve Grissom is wrong; that the courage he has shown in the face of extraordinary adversity is something that should be admired and looked up to. He is absolutely entitled to the benefit of the doubt, to the extent there is any doubt, that a specialist at Duke University has determined that he is entitled to this treatment that he so desperately needs.

   Mr. EDWARDS. The Senator's question highlights an enormous problem in existing law and a problem that we are trying to desperately cure in this Patients' Bill of Rights. 
   Under the circumstance I have just described, if something happens to Steve Grissom, i.e., he suffers more serious injury or dies as a result of an arbitrary decision made by an insurance company bureaucrat, if that occurs, first of all, under the existing law, that HMO and that bureaucrat cannot in any way be held responsible. They are totally immune to responsibility, unlike every other American--you, I, any other American--who could be held accountable in court for that decision. They are totally immune from responsibility. They are protected. 
   As a result, they only have one incentive for what they do, and that incentive is the green dollar bill, the profit, the bottom line. It is the only thing that matters to them. That is the basis on which these decisions are made. 
   Not only that, not only can they not be held accountable in court, I say to the Senator, there is not even an independent review board that can look at this decision that has been made and determine whether it is unfair, whether it is unjust, and whether it is medically unsound. 
   So basically, Steve Grissom and his family, in this life-threatening situation, are confronted with a circumstance where they have no remedy at all. They can do absolutely nothing. 
   Does that answer the Senator's question?

<TEXT>
   Mr. EDWARDS. That is exactly what I am suggesting, I say to the Senator. 
   I add, anecdotally, one of the things that the Senator knows, I have come from 20 years of having represented folks in court cases. One of the questions we always ask jurors in the process of jury selection is: Do you believe everyone should be treated exactly the same in this courtroom? Universally, the answer is yes. Because the American people are fairminded. They believe everyone should be treated equally, everyone should be treated the same. They believe in both personal and corporate responsibility, that everybody ought to be held accountable for what they do or do not do--the very same way we teach our children they should be held accountable for what they do or do not do. 
   Instead, under existing law in this country, we have decided HMOs and health insurance companies are privileged characters. They get treated in a way that no other American business is treated, that no other American citizen--the people who are listening to this debate--is treated. They are held responsible for what they do. 
   But for some reason, under the law, unless and until we are able to change it, HMOs and health insurance companies are treated in a very privileged way. They cannot be held responsible for what they do. Unfortunately, that has enormous consequences for people, for families, and for children. The consequence is they have no reason to do anything other than the profit motivation, and the bottom line, which is the dollar. That is one of the problems we are working desperately to cure in our Patients' Bill of Rights.

   Mr. EDWARDS. May I respond to that briefly, I say to Senator KENNEDY? 
   I would ask for a comment from you on this issue. In terms of talking to your constituents in Massachusetts, can you tell me what response you have gotten, including from health care providers, on the issue of whether it is important to them, No. 1, that there be an independent review board so when folks' claims are denied, they have some ready process to use to get relief, and, secondly, whether they believe it is fair for HMOs and health insurance companies to be treated completely differently than every other segment of American society?

   Mr. EDWARDS. I thank the Senator. I will conclude my remarks. The point I make is so important, which is that this is not a partisan debate. This is not a debate and should not be a debate between Democrats and Republicans. I didn't come to the Senate to fight with my Republican colleagues. I came to the Senate to represent the people of North Carolina--Republicans, Democrats, Independents, whatever their politics. We desperately need to talk about the specific provisions of a real, substantive, meaningful Patients' Bill of Rights. That is what needs to happen. That is the reason we are on the floor today talking about this amendment. It is the reason this amendment has been attached to the agriculture appropriations bill. 
   We need desperately to talk about these issues because they are so critically important to the people of my State--all of the people of my State--and they are important to all Americans. We have to make sure that folks have direct access to specialty care. It does absolutely no good for us to have the most advanced medical care and treatment and research in the world in this country if folks can't get to it. Folks have to be able to have access to the high-quality medical care that is constantly advancing on a daily basis in medical centers throughout this country, including medical centers in my home State, including Duke University Medical Center, University of North Carolina, Bowman Grey, and East Carolina University. 
   We have great medical centers in North Carolina. But those folks and the care they can provide do no good whatsoever if they can't provide the treatment to the patients. That is where health insurance companies, HMOs, stand as a roadblock between the doctors and the health care providers who are spending their lives developing these lifesaving treatments and the patients who so desperately need them.  
   Steve Grissom, the gentlemen I described with leukemia and AIDS, is a perfect example. There are heroes all over this country, all over North Carolina, who are standing up and fighting battles against health problems that are critical to them and their families. We have to give them direct access to the treatment and care that can save their lives and change the lives of their families. 
   It is very simple. The bottom line is this: Patients, not profits, should be the bottom line in health care. That is what this Patients' Bill of Rights is about. We simply want an opportunity to talk about it to our colleagues, whom we respect, on the floor of the Senate, to talk about it to the American people. And I am telling you, the American people in their gut know that this is something that needs to be passed, needs to be done, and that health insurance companies and HMOs absolutely should not stand between children and families and the health care that, in many cases, can save their lives. 
   With that, I yield the floor.

   Mr. EDWARDS. I thank the Chair. 
   Mr. President, we have a bill before us today that has had a great deal of discussion. I just listened to my friend, the distinguished Senator from Connecticut, discuss it. He and I agree about a great many things. We agree about a great many things with respect to this bill. 
   I think it makes great sense to pass a moderate, thoughtful bill that provides protection for the computer industry. I think it makes sense to create incentives for consumers, buyers of computer products and those people who sell those products to, No. 1, try to remedy any Y2K problems that might exist with the computers they purchase and, No. 2, to work together to solve any problem that either of them may have, either the seller or the purchaser. 
   I think it makes a great deal of sense, as a result of that, to have a cooling off period. I think the 90-day cooling off period is something I strongly support. I add to that, I strongly support the idea of alternative dispute resolution which has been discussed at great length on the floor of the Senate. I think all those things accomplish positive things. They accomplish the goal of providing some legitimate protection for the computer industry. They accomplish the goal of having folks work together to try to avoid lawsuits. I think those are things that we ought to support. 
   There is a fundamental problem with this particular bill. The problem is this: There are going to be cases where purchasers of computers, whether they be consumers or small businesspeople, are going to suffer legitimate losses. They are going to have a Y2K problem. Their business is going to get shut down. They are going to have to continue to make payroll. All of us who grew up with small businesses understand that proposition. They are going to have to keep paying their employees, keep having overhead. But as a result of a Y2K problem, they do not keep generating revenue. 
   They are going to have a real and substantial loss. The computer company or salespeople who sold them the computer may well be responsible for that loss. In those cases where the computer company or the manufacturer acted in a reckless or irresponsible way on one hand, and in addition to that, we have a purchaser who suffered a real substantial and legitimate loss--I am not talking about something frivolous, not talking about their VCR won't work; I am talking about their family-run and family-owned business has been put out of business--that loss exists as a result of a Y2K problem clearly caused by somebody's irresponsibility, what we have to recognize is that loss will not go away. It exists. It exists in reality. It exists in the pocketbook of this small businessman. 
   The question is really very simple. Who will bear that real and legitimate loss when it occurs? 
   There are two problems in this bill. One has to do with the issue of joint and several liability. The other has to do with economic loss. They are both devastating in how they deal with that issue. 
   If you start with the basic premise that that loss which has been suffered by the consumer or a small businessperson is a real loss that is not going to go away, then the question becomes, who is going to pay for it? By eliminating joint and several liability, what we have said by law is if there are multiple parties who may be responsible, but for some reason one of those parties can't be reached, that we are going to shift 
   that part of the responsibility, whatever, because it is an offshore company, if it is a company going bankrupt, out of business, whatever, and that company was 20 percent responsible, that loss gets shifted to the innocent consumer, the businessman, under this law. That is exactly what this law does. 
   Joint and several liability has existed in this country for 200 years. It exists for a simple reason--because it is fair and it is equitable. 
   What we say in the law of the United States is that we always want the guilty to pay and not the innocent. What this law does is, it changes that fundamental premise. If a Y2K problem exists and an innocent consumer or businessman suffers as a result, that share of the loss that can't be recovered will be borne not by those who participated in the loss, the guilty, but will be borne by the innocent. That is one problem. 
   There is a second problem that is even more devastating. This bill essentially eliminates the right to recover economic losses, which means, in my example, a small businessman whose family-run-and-owned business has been put out of business, as between him or her and a computer company or computer sales business that has sold the computer to him knowing it was non-Y2K compliant, as between those two, what we say in this law is, the innocent purchaser will bear the loss. 
   It is so important for all of my colleagues and the American people to recognize that there has been a lot of rhetoric on the floor about lawsuits and lawyers and the trial bar I heard Senator DODD talking about a few minutes ago. This has nothing to do with lawyers. What we are taking about and  what we ought to be talking about is who is going to be protected by this bill and who is going to be hurt by it. 
   We know who is going to be protected. The big computer companies will be protected. Now the question is, Who will be hurt? It is not lawyers that will be hurt. The people who will be hurt are consumers and small businessmen. It really becomes a very simple proposition. We are protecting the big guy, and we are shifting that injury and damage to the little guy. It is the little guy that gets hurt by this bill. 
   In my example where a computer has been sold that is non-Y2K compliant, the people who sold it did it absolutely intentionally. They knew exactly what they were doing and some innocent businessman in a small town in North Carolina gets put out of business. If this law passes, this is what he can recover; he can recover the cost of his computer. 
   Well, he is going to have a great time explaining to his family, to his mother and father, who spent their life building up his business, that they have been put out of business and they can identify who caused it and they did it intentionally and willfully and they were irresponsible, but all they can ever get back is the cost of their computer. 
   It is fundamentally wrong. It is inequitable and it is unfair. That is what is wrong with this bill. 
   I want to mention three specific examples that I think show the American people what a problem we have. Example No. 1, let's suppose we have a businessman who runs his assembly line with a computer system. On November 15, 1999, this year, the computer salesman comes to him and sells him a new system. Let's assume that computer salesman knows the system is not Y2K compliant. On January 2, 2000, his assembly line comes to a grinding halt. It does so because of this Y2K problem. The people who sold it to him were reckless and irresponsible in doing so. He has lost all of his sales. He can't produce a product. 
   Let's assume that some of his customers will void their contracts, which they would. He doesn't have what they need and they have to get their product somewhere. They void their contract because he doesn't have anything to sell them. He can't meet payroll. For about 3 weeks, he is able to pay his people, but he can't meet payroll now because he has nothing to sell anymore. He goes out of business. Under section 12 of this bill, under that example, this is what this manufacturer can recover: The cost of the computer. He may have lost thousands and thousands of dollars. He has been put out of business, and what he can get back is the $5,000 cost of the computer. That is one example. 
   Let me give a second example. Suppose a businessman buys a computer program that manages his billings, his promotional mailing, and his data bases. On January 1, 2000, the program fails and renders the computer unworkable. The business can't send out its bills and loses the use of its mailing list and data base for more than 2 months; as a result, it goes under. Under this bill, he has been run out of business--clearly a Y2K problem, clearly the responsibility of the people who sold him the computer system. But all he can recover is the cost of his computer. 
   Finally, assume that we have a doctor who buys an infusion pump which is run by a computer, which is done all over the country in doctors' offices, and he uses it for a surgical procedure in his office. Because of a Y2K problem, it fails during surgery and a patient he cares about is severely injured as a result. They sue him for malpractice. He has to pay some huge judgment. He doesn't have enough insurance to cover it, so he loses thousands and thousands of dollars and his business is ruined. What that doctor who is operating in small town North Carolina is allowed to recover is the cost of his computer. 
   The problem is--and all three of these examples show it--it is very fundamental to the problem existing in this bill. We are going to have real and legitimate losses that are caused by irresponsible conduct. The vast majority of computer companies in this country will act responsibly, but the reality is, as we all know, there will be a minority of those companies that do not act responsibly. We are going to have small businesspeople and consumers all across the United States who have real losses. I think my colleagues, Senator MCCAIN, Senator WYDEN, and Senator DODD, would all recognize that is true. That is reality. 
   What we do when we pass this bill is we take that real, legitimate loss that has to be borne by somebody--it doesn't disappear into thin air because the Congress of the United States passes a law. These folks who run small businesses and these consumers are going to have some real losses. It is a simple question: Who pays for those losses? 
   What I propose is that we have a bill that creates every conceivable incentive to cure Y2K problems, to cause these people who have legitimate complaints to work to solve those problems; that makes the purchaser do everything in his power to reduce his losses, to act in a very responsible way; that we streamline the process; that we find a way to have alternative dispute resolution; that we make the court procedure as simple as it can possibly be. All of those things would go to help with any litigation that might occur, or any day in court that may occur. 
   The problem is that this bill takes that loss that is real and legitimate and says we are going to go a step further; we are going to say when somebody suffers a real and meaningful loss, we are going to make the innocent consumer and the small businessman bear that loss. It is fundamentally wrong. It is inequitable. It violates every principle of law that exists in this country. 
   The American people absolutely do not believe in this and would not support it. They don't want frivolous lawsuits. None of us do. We ought to cut those off. They want people to use alternative dispute resolution. They don't want people going to the courthouse the first time they have a problem. We ought to do something about that. But what we should not do is throw the baby out with the bath water. There are going to be real people out there who have real losses, and it is simply not right--and the American people in their gut know it is not right--to take that loss and shift it from the people who are responsible to the innocent people who have suffered. 
   I will make one last comment and I will be finished. I have heard Senator DODD and Senator WYDEN talk at great length about the sunset nature of this bill, that this is a 3-year bill. With all due respect to those arguments, I think they are a smokescreen. This bill will cover virtually every Y2K problem that exists, because by the very nature of the problem, it is going to come into existence in the year 2000. So it doesn't make any difference. They could cut it off in 2 years, or in a year and a half. It would not make any difference whatsoever. It could be 20 years. It is going to cover exactly the same losses--those losses that rear their ugly heads in the year 2000 because of a Y2K problem. 
   So what I say to my colleagues and to the American people 
   is that, being from a State where we are very proud of our technology industry and believing that the great majority of technology companies act in a very responsible way, I think it makes a lot of sense to provide some thoughtful protection for those folks and to provide the kind of incentives we have talked about today. But I don't think we should go so far and be so drastic and so dramatic as to take away a real and legitimate loss and to take that loss, which is not going to disappear, and shift it from the people who are responsible for it to the innocent consumers and to innocent small businesspeople. I think that is wrong. I think it is protecting the big guy against the little guy. For that reason, I oppose this bill and will vote against it. 
   I yield the remainder of my time.

   Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, I would like to respond very briefly to my colleague from Oregon, Senator WYDEN. 
   First, I point out that based on my study of the issue it appears to me that virtually every consumer group which is composed of, among others, small businesspeople around this country is opposed to this bill. 
   Second, and more importantly, Senator WYDEN said--I am quoting him--that the ``bill permits recovery of damages for foreseeable consequences.'' 
   I say with all due respect to my colleagues that is exactly what the bill does not permit. That language appears nowhere in this bill. I challenge him, since he has made that statement, to find the language in the bill that says ``damages for foreseeable consequences.''

   Mr. EDWARDS. My response to that is, first of all, the vast majority of the computers are not bought pursuant to a written law in contract, because most folks are not able to hire a team of lawyers to draft a contract on their behalf. So the contracting is a meaningless concept, except as between one  big company buying the computer system from another big company. Otherwise, contracts don't exist. In the absence of a contract, this bill eliminates recovery of economic losses. 
   It is that simple. They do not allow for the recovery of damages that are the result of foreseeable consequences. 
   It is a huge, fundamental problem with this bill. It will not allow people to recover anything but the cost of their computer. That is what the bill says.

   Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, the purpose of this amendment is to deal with section 12 of the McCain-Dodd-Wyden bill. Let me read it first to make it clear what the amendment deals with. I am quoting from the amendment now, and this would replace section 12 in the existing bill:  
   A party to a Y2K action making a tort claim may only recover for economic losses to the extent allowed under applicable State or Federal law in effect on January 1, 1999.  
   We have drawn this amendment in the narrowest possible fashion, and we did that for a number of reasons. Number one, there has been great concern voiced on the floor of the Senate about allowing and continuing to enforce existing contracts under contract law. This amendment has no impact on that whatsoever. The provisions in the McCain bill that provide for the enforcement of contract law remain in place. 
   I also say to my colleagues that if this amendment is adopted in the very narrow form in which it has been presented, all of the following things, which I think many Members of the Senate want to support, remain present in this bill. 
   Punitive damages will remain capped. The bill will continue to apply to everyone--consumers and businessmen and businesswomen. Joint and several liability is completely gone. In other words, proportionate liability, which has been a subject of great discussion, remains in place. The duty to mitigate remains in place. The 90-day waiting period remains in place. The limitations on class actions remain in place. The requirements of specificity and materiality in pleadings remain in place. 
   All of the things that have been discussed at great length and have been at the top of the list of what these folks have been trying to accomplish on behalf of the computer industry remain in place. 
   What this amendment is intended to do is close a loophole. It is a loophole that is enormous. Here is the reason. We will enforce, under the provisions of the McCain bill, a contract. The problem is, there are millions and millions of computer sales that occur in this country every year that are subject to no contract; there is no contract between the parties. Under the provisions of the McCain bill, as it is presently, if a consumer or a small businessperson purchases a computer, there is no written contract between the parties, which will be true in the vast majority of cases; so there is no contract to enforce, there is no agreement between the parties on the specific terms of what can be recovered and what the limitations of those recoveries are. 
   Let's suppose, in my example, that a blatant, fraudulent misrepresentation has been made to the purchaser. Unless we do something to amend this section, since there is no contract in place, we will put the purchaser in the position of being able to recover absolutely nothing but the cost of their computer. For example, a small family-run business in a small town in North Carolina--Murfreesboro, NC--buys a computer system. There is no written contract of any kind between the parties. What happens is, their computer system doesn't work; it is non-Y2K compliant. It turns out that the people who sold it to them knew it was non-Y2K compliant and, in fact, misrepresented when they made the sale that it was Y2K compliant. So we have, in fact, what probably is a criminal act in addition to everything else, a fraudulent misrepresentation. 
   Unless this amendment is adopted, if that family business has lost revenues, lost income, lost profits, while they continue to incur overhead, they are unable to recover even their out-of-pocket losses--the money they have to actually pay as a result of their computer being non-Y2K compliant--simply because there is no contract between the parties. That would be true even under the most egregious situation, i.e., where a fraud has occurred, where a misrepresentation has occurred, where a criminal act has occurred, even under those extreme circumstances. 
   Unless this amendment is adopted in its very narrowly drawn form, that purchaser, small businessperson or consumer, is limited to the recovery of the cost of their computer, even though their family-owned business, which has been in business forever, has been put out of business, even though they have lost thousands of dollars in revenue, even though they have had to pay out of their pocket for losses that have occurred as a result of a fraud committed against them. Even if the defendant can be put in jail for their conduct, this small businessperson is out of business, and what they can recover against this defendant is the cost of their computer. 
   There is a huge, huge loophole that exists in this bill as presently drafted, and that loophole is for all those cases across America where there is no contract. That is going to be true in the vast majority of cases. Most people don't have contracts. They go to the computer store and they buy a computer. Some computer salesman comes to their business or home and sells them a computer. So what we are left with is what happens to those folks--the folks who don't have a contract, which is going to be the vast majority of Americans, businessmen, businesswomen, consumers who have purchased computers. They are not going to have a contract. 
   I will tell you who will have a contract. The folks who will have contracts--therefore, their remedies will be clearly defined in the contract--will be big businesses. That will be true of the computer companies who sell their products because they can afford to hire a big team of lawyers to represent them and draft contracts for them. That will be true of big corporate purchasers of computer systems who need them in the operation of their business, such as Kaiser-Permanente and other big companies that use computers. The lawyers get together and draft the contracts and everybody knows from the beginning what the responsibilities of both the seller and the buyer are. 
   The problem we have is that it is not going to be the big guys who are going to be protected. It is the little guy who has absolutely no protection. The only conceivable remedy they have is in tort. 
   What we did in this very narrowly drafted provision is say they can recover economic losses only to the extent allowed already under State law or Federal law, which means that to the extent in Arizona there may be a limitation, or in Utah, or in Oregon, a limitation on what folks can recover and what they have to prove. There are some States that only allow pure out-of-pocket losses to be recovered--not lost profits. There are many States that have limitations on these things. 
   We create absolutely no cause of action, no tort claim. We create nothing that does not already exist. But we close the loophole. The loophole we close is for those millions and millions of Americans who will not have a contract. It is just that simple. All the other protections in this bill remain in place. 
   I want to say to my colleagues who have voted already against Senator KERRY's amendment, who intend to vote on final passage for the McCain bill, that you can vote for this amendment very narrowly drawn which closes the loophole that exists and still vote for the bill on final passage. I will not be doing that myself, because I think there are other problems in the bill. But this amendment does not create any problem with that.  
   I just want to point out a couple of things which were said yesterday during the debate by my friend, Senator WYDEN from Oregon. 
   He said:  
   I just think it would be a mistake given the extraordinary potential for economic calamity in the next century to change the law with respect to economic loss. We are neither broadening it nor narrowing it. We are keeping it in place.  
   That is a verbatim quote. 
   This amendment couldn't be any clearer. All it does is keep existing State law in place for those people who do not have a contract. It is that simple. If they have a contract, the contract is going to control because the section immediately preceding section 11 specifically requires that the courts enforce the existing contract. But for all those folks out there who do not have a contract and who may have been lied to, or who may have had misrepresentations made to them and are maybe subject to criminal conduct, they have no remedy whatsoever under this bill. That is the reason we have drawn it so narrowly. 
   Again, Senator WYDEN pointed out yesterday that he believes they should recover exactly what they are entitled to today, that the law is exactly what they are entitled to recover today, and there are numerous quotes throughout the day where Senator WYDEN spoke to this issue. 
   What I say to my friend Senator WYDEN is what I really believe we are doing here. I know he expressed concern yesterday about creating causes of action, creating force in Senator KERRY's bill, and I understood those concerns. What we have done is draft this in a way that can't possibly create anything. What it says is they may only recover for economic losses to the extent allowed already under existing State or 
   Federal law. 
   When you put that combination in with the provision immediately preceding it that requires contracts to be enforced, then I think what we have done is closed a loophole, closed it in the narrowest possible fashion. Leave all the restrictions that already exist on economic recovery in this country in place, deal with those millions of Americans who could have been the subject of fraud, abuse, and misrepresentation and allow them to recover, because otherwise they have no possible way of recovering. They have no contract. But to the extent folks have a contract, we are going to enforce that contract. We are going to require that the courts enforce that contract. 
   I think this really dovetails perfectly with what I believe to be the intent of the McCain-Wyden bill. 
   The bottom line on this amendment is this: It is narrowly drawn. Those folks who intend to vote on final passage for the McCain bill can vote for this amendment perfectly consistent with their desire to do everything they can to protect the computer industry. But for that class of people who have no contract, who have no cause of action whatsoever, this creates nothing. It simply allows under existing law for them to pursue whatever claim they have--only those people who have absolutely no contract. If they have a contract, the contract is going to be enforced, and it ought to be enforced. I have no problem with that whatsoever. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. It is narrowly drawn. I think it is consistent entirely with the purposes of the McCain bill. It leaves all the protections in place that the folks who support the McCain bill believe in. It closes an enormous loophole that exists in this law at the present time. 
   I reserve the remainder of my time.

   Mr. EDWARDS. If I can respond briefly to the comments of the distinguished Senator from Utah, first I say to Senator HATCH I am absolutely willing, and the people of North Carolina are willing, to live with the law in North Carolina. What my amendment does is leave all existing law in place in this very narrow area. 
   The problem is that, for example, I know under North Carolina law, if a fraudulent misrepresentation--if a crime--is committed, if somebody makes a fraudulent misrepresentation and as a result somebody is put out of business, they are entitled to recover their economic losses, because there is an exception for intentional fraud, there is an exception for a criminal act. 
   The McCain bill has no such exception. It has no exceptions at all.

   Mr. EDWARDS. I say to Senator HATCH I respectfully disagree with that. If you look at the section, it has no exceptions of that nature in it at all. It has no exception. There is a powerful limitation on the recovery of economic loss, essentially eliminating the right to recover for economic loss. And there is no exception in that section for intentional, there is no exception for fraud and misrepresentation, there is no exception for egregious, reckless conduct. None of those things is excepted from the limitation on economic loss. 
   I might add, to the extent we are looking for uniformity when we are going to enforce contracts--there has been a great deal of discussion about contract law--we are going to enforce contracts under State law. So whatever the State law is, in the various States across the country, is going to be enforced under State law. 
   So what I respectfully disagree with the Senator about is what I believe my amendment does, which is, in a very narrow fashion, it works in concert with the section immediately preceding it, and the section immediately preceding it requires every court in this land to enforce any existing contract. So if there is a contract, that contract will be enforced. It cannot be subverted by any kind of tort claim. 
   What my amendment does, is it allows a remedy to all those millions of people who could have been the victims of fraud, who could have been the victims of reckless conduct, who could have been the victims of carelessness and negligence, who have absolutely no remedy; they cannot recover any of their out-of-pocket losses or any of those things. What my amendment does is it creates no new torts, no causes of action, no anything. When you talk, at great length, about the economic loss rule, the Supreme Court, and how various States have adopted it, it simply leaves that law in place. That is all it does, and only for those folks who have no other remedy because they have no contract.

   Mr. EDWARDS. Only with respect to economic loss, which is what we are talking about. 
   In any event, my belief is, what we are dealing with is a situation where anybody, any little guy in the country who has no contract basically has no remedy. They cannot do anything. 
   To the extent we talk about this being just a 3-year bill, that 3-year period, in the nature of the Y2K problem, is going to cover every single Y2K problem that exists in the country. This problem is going to erupt in the year 2000. Three years is plenty of time to cover every single problem that is going to occur in this country. To the extent the argument is made that it is a limited bill, it is going to cover every single Y2K loss that will occur in this country. 
   What I am trying to do with this amendment, which is very narrowly drawn, is create no new claims, no new causes of action, to have a provision that works in concert with the requirement that contracts be enforced. But for all those folks who have no contract, if their State allows them to recover for out-of-pocket losses, then they would be allowed to do that. If they have been the victim of fraud, if they have been the subject of criminal conduct, if they have been the victim of simple recklessness or negligent conduct, only if their State allows that would they be allowed to recover that loss. 
   Every other limitation in this bill stays in place: No joint and several, caps on punitive damages, duty to mitigate, 90-day waiting period, alternative dispute resolution, limitation  on class action, specificity of pleadings and materiality--all those things stay in place. 
   We are simply saying for those little guys across America who do not have a team of lawyers representing them drafting contracts, they ought to have a right to recover what they had to pay out of pocket as a result of somebody being irresponsible with respect to a Y2K problem.

   Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, the purpose of this amendment is very simple. It is to provide that this bill, which provides many protections to those people who sell computer products for Y2K problems, not apply after January 1 of 1999, after this bill began its process of consideration in the Congress, because it is absolutely obvious that everybody in the country has known about this problem for many years and has been documented. It has actually been known for a period of 40 years and intensely watched over the last few years. Certainly every computer company in the world knew about Y2K before the beginning of January 1, 1999, when we began consideration of this legislation. There is a reason that this amendment is needed and necessary. Let me give an example. 
   There are 800 medical devices that are produced by manufacturers across this country that are date sensitive and critical to the health care of people in this country, because a malfunction can cause injury to people. 
   Approximately 2,000 manufacturers sell these medical devices. About 200 of those manufacturers, 10 percent, have yet to contact the FDA about whether their medical devices are Y2K compliant. After being asked numerous times by the FDA, they have given no response. These are people who have been on notice for a long time about this problem. 
   It is really a very simple amendment. What the amendment says is, beginning in 1999, when everybody on the planet knew that this was a huge problem, if you kept selling non-Y2K-compliant products, you certainly should not have any of the protections of this bill, with one exception: We still keep in place the 90-day cooling off or waiting period because we think it is reasonable for the manufacturer or the seller to have that period of time to look at the problem and work with the purchaser to see if it can be resolved, even if they put a product in commerce unreasonably knowing that this problem existed. 
   The amendment says that folks who kept selling, beginning in 1999, non-Y2K-compliant products, knowing full well that this problem existed, knowing that the Congress was about to consider legislation on this issue and knowing that they were acting irresponsibly, should not have the protection of the McCain bill. That is the purpose and reason for this amendment. 
   The FDA example is a perfect example. We have 200 companies out there who are unwilling to tell the FDA they have even looked to determine whether their medical products that involve the safety and lives of people are Y2K compliant. 
   There is nothing in the McCain bill that prevents companies from continuing--I mean through today--selling non-Y2K-compliant products. I know in the spirit in which this bill was offered and intended that my colleagues would not have intended that we continue to allow, as a nation and as a Congress, people to engage in reckless, irresponsible conduct without holding them accountable for that, even today, knowing full well this problem exists. It simply excises from protection of this bill all those folks who continue, even today, to sell non-Y2K-compliant products unreasonably; that is, knowing that they are selling non-Y2K-compliant products. 
   I reserve the remainder of my time.

   Mr. EDWARDS. I say to my friend, Senator DODD, he and I actually agree about the vast majority of what he just said. I think this bill in place, if it passes, will do all the things the computer industry wants to protect them against Y2K problems. 
   Joint and several liability is gone. There is a cap on punitive damages. The duty to mitigate isn't present. There is a 90-day waiting period, cooling off period. We have the 36 months. We have class action limitations. We have specificity and materiality of pleading. 
   This is a very narrow, simple thing that we are trying to accomplish with this first amendment. We will enforce contracts as they exist. That is what these folks have been talking about at great length, and that is exactly what we should do. 
   The problem is with those folks who do not have a contract, which is going to be the vast majority of Americans. When Senator SESSIONS says that the economic loss rule is a traditional rule, he is right about that. What my amendment says is that traditional rule stays in place exactly as it is. 
   The problem is, the provision in this bill, in the McCain bill, is not the traditional rule. It contains no exceptions of any kind--no exceptions for fraud, no exceptions for reckless conduct, no exceptions for irresponsibility. The result of that is, regular people who buy computers--small businessmen, small businesswomen, consumers, folks who do not have an army of lawyers who went in and crafted contracts on their behalf--have no remedy. They simply have no remedy; they cannot get anything, not even their out-of-pocket loss. That is what the McCain bill does. 
   What I have done in the narrowest conceivable fashion is drawn an amendment that allows those folks to recover only what their State law permits them to recover. 
   It is just that simple. That is on the first amendment. 
   On the second amendment, I just can't imagine what the argument is against this, although I heard the distinguished Senator from Utah argue against it. The very idea that people who are today, in 1999, selling non-Y2K-compliant products irresponsibly--and that is what is required--if they sell it without knowing about it, then they are still covered by the bill. Under my amendment, if they sell it knowingly, if they sell it irresponsibly in 1999, today, it simply says: Surely the Congress of the United States is not going to protect you. You have known about this forever. We are not going to continue to protect you. 
   It is not going to create a flood of litigation. I have to respectfully disagree with my friend, Senator HATCH. That makes no sense at all. If the consumer didn't buy the product in 1999, and they can't show the product was sold and put into the stream of commerce irresponsibly in 1999, then the McCain bill is going to apply to them. Surely my colleagues do not want to provide this Congress's, this Senate's protection, stamp of approval for people to keep selling noncompliant Y2K products, including, in my example, people who sell medical devices that can cause injury and death to people. I just don't believe my colleagues on either side of the aisle want their stamp on allowing people to keep doing this, even though they are fully aware of it. 
   That is simply what my amendment addresses. It says if you are still selling this stuff, and you are selling it non-Y2K compliant, and you know what you are doing, you don't get the benefit of the McCain bill. 
   It couldn't be any simpler than that. I respectfully suggest to my colleagues  they do not want to put their stamp on people who have known about this problem forever and are doing nothing about it. Not only that, knowingly continuing to sell non-Y2K-compliant products that can cause injury to business, and, in the medical device fields, can cause injury to people, I just do not believe my colleagues on either side of the aisle would want to support that. This amendment cures that problem. 
   With that, I yield back the remainder of my time and ask for the yeas and nays on both amendments.

   Mr. EDWARDS. I thank the Chair. 
   Mr. President, I will speak briefly to the McCain bill and to Senator KERRY's amendment, which I think should be recognized as a real effort by Senator KERRY to cure some of the problems that exist with the McCain bill. 
   From my perspective, I think what we are trying to accomplish here is to find a reasonable, moderate approach that both protects the rights and interests of consumers while at the same time ensuring that computer company manufacturers have the protection that they need and deserve. 
   There has been a lot of talk today about frivolous lawsuits. The McCain bill has very little, if anything, to do with frivolous lawsuits. The two provisions in that bill that all of the Senators have spent a great deal of time on and that have caused the most controversy are joint and several liability and economic loss. Those two provisions have absolutely nothing to do with frivolous lawsuits. 
   Speaking for myself, and, I think, speaking for Senator KERRY, both of us are opposed to any kind of frivolous lawsuit. I would be willing to support any provision that would provide protection against frivolous lawsuits. The two provisions that we are talking about, the elimination of joint and several liability and the elimination, from my perspective, of the right to recover economic loss, are both things that occur after a defendant has been found responsible. In other words, before you ever get to those two provisions, you have to first determine that there has been some irresponsible behavior on behalf of a defendant. 
   The idea that those provisions, which are really the most controversial provisions in this bill, have anything to do with frivolous lawsuits just doesn't make any sense. They have absolutely nothing to do with frivolous lawsuits. 
   For example, joint and several liability has to do with who you can recover against and what percentage or proportion of your damages you can recover, once a jury has determined that the defendant acted irresponsibly or in violation of a contract. 
   The economic loss provision has to do with whether the small business owner or the consumer is allowed to recover for lost profits, lost overhead, out-of-pocket costs, once it has been determined that, in fact, the defendant is at fault. So the idea that this has anything to do with frivolous lawsuits is just misleading. The bill has very little, if anything, to do with frivolous lawsuits. 
   If what we are concerned about is getting these cases resolved, creating incentives for consumers, small business people, people who have purchased computers, people who have a Y2K problem, to work with the computer manufacturers, with the people who manufacture the component parts of computers, I think that makes a great deal of sense. 
   But this bill doesn't do that. Instead, what this bill doesn't do, in contrast to Senator KERRY's amendment, is strike a proper balance between providing reasonable protections for computer companies, while at the same time making sure we protect consumers. There has been an awful lot of discussion on the floor today about lawyers and the interests of lawyers. The reality is that lawyers and the discussion about frivolous lawsuits have little or nothing to do with this bill. Lawyers didn't make these computers; lawyers didn't have anything to do with the manufacture of these computer chips. And it is not lawyers who are going to be injured as a result of this bill. The people who are going to be hurt are consumers, the people who have purchased these computers. 
   I think it is really important that we as Senators focus on the people who are most likely to be injured as a result of the passage of this bill. Now, there are two provisions in the McCain bill that I think Senator KERRY's amendment addresses that are critically important. The first, and the one I want to focus most of my attention on, is a provision about economic losses. This is under section 12 of the bill entitled ``Damages and Tort Claims.'' 
   What this provision does--and this is a provision of the McCain-Dodd-Wyden bill--is it eliminates the right to recover economic losses by a small businessman if a computer or a computer chip manufacturer irresponsibly creates a Y2K problem. Let me give you an example, and I think this example is very important. A small businessman in Murfreesboro, NC, is in his business establishment one day and a computer salesman comes in the door and says: I have this great computer system I  want to sell you that will make your operation more efficient. It will help you operate your cash registers. It will help with your accounting. It will help with your collections. The businessman heard about all these Y2K problems, but he was told by the salesman this system is totally Y2K compliant. 
   This small businessman, believing what he was told, buys the computer system. Well, come the year 2000, he begins to have problems, and the problems shut down his cash registers, shut down his accounting system, shut down his ability to collect; and this business, which he and his family have been involved in all their lives, all of a sudden has no cash-flow. So they lose profit and they continue to incur overhead, and over a period of 2 or 3 months they essentially lose everything they have spent their lives working on--all as a result of a Y2K problem that, in my example, the computer salesman knew existed when he sold them the computer. 
   In other words, when he made the statement to this businessman that this system was totally Y2K compliant, he knew full well what he was saying was not true. In fact, the evidence available to him indicated it was not Y2K compliant. So he made a fraudulent misrepresentation, a misstatement to this businessman. 
   Under that example, under the terms of the McCain bill, this is what that businessman who has been put out of business for the rest of his life--a family business they spent their entire lives building up--is entitled to recover: The cost of his computer. 
   So if he spent $3,000 on the computer as a result of this misrepresentation by the computer salesman, and he has been put out of business forever, under this bill--which will, by the way, control all of these cases regardless of what State law provides, and I want to talk about that in just a moment--this small businessman is out of business and what he can get back is the cost of his computer. So what the bill does, in essence, is it provides absolute immunity, with the exception of the cost of the computer. 
   I want to be clear about one other thing. There has been a lot of discussion about punitive damages on the Senate floor. Punitive damages are damages that are awarded to punish a defendant for highly egregious conduct. But punitive damages have nothing whatsoever to do with what I am talking about now. We are now talking about a small businessperson being able to recover lost profits, having to shut down his or her business, having to 
   continue to pay overhead in connection with the operation of that business. These are normal damages to be recovered without reference to punitive damages. 
   What I am saying is a very simple thing. If this bill passes, then a negligent computer chip manufacturer, a computer salesman, or computer company that sells computers, that outright lies--I am talking about engages in a fraudulent misrepresentation in their sales--can only be held responsible for the cost of the computer. That is exactly what this bill provides. 
   I respectfully disagree with what my colleague, Senator WYDEN, said earlier today, that all Federal and State remedies for economic loss are left in place. I think exactly the opposite is true. In fact, what this bill does is eliminate, to the extent that a cause of action exists under State law, the ability to recover for economic losses. 
   So what we have is a huge, huge problem. We have a provision in the bill where, prospectively, we are going to say to small and large businessmen and women around this country that if somebody has made a misrepresentation to you about the computer system you were buying, No. 1, and No. 2, if they irresponsibly and recklessly sold you a computer system that was not Y2K compliant, i.e., they didn't act with reasonable care or they acted negligently, what we are going to let you recover is the cost of your computer; and you cannot recover any of the costs associated with the operation of your business, your lost profits, and all of the costs associated with the day-to-day running of the business. 
   I don't believe there is an American out there listening to this who would believe that is fair. It is not fair. Now, I might add, for Senators WYDEN, MCCAIN and DODD, that there are provisions in this bill that I have absolutely no problem with. I think we want to create incentives for people to work together. We want to create incentives for manufacturers to solve this problem. I think a 90-day cooling off period is a good idea. I think the idea of having an alternative dispute resolution so that folks have a mechanism outside having to file a lawsuit and go to court is a very good idea. These are all very positive things. 
   The problem is that, ultimately, there are going to be people across this country who, because of somebody acting irresponsibly or somebody misrepresenting something to them, are going to have problems with their business that will cause lost profits, lost overhead, which could ultimately lead to a shutdown of their business. And they will be able to recover absolutely nothing but the cost of their computer. I might add that later I intend to offer an amendment that specifically addresses this problem. 
   I just don't believe that is what the American people would support. It is fundamentally unfair because what you have is a small businessperson who acted in good faith, innocently, in purchasing a computer system, and as a result of a law passed in this Congress, that person would be out of business, through no fault of his own. But the person who is at fault and is totally responsible for what happened to him is only responsible for paying for the cost of the computer. The bottom line is, if this guy gets hurt and they get caught, what they have to pay is the money they originally got from these folks, which is the cost of the computer. That is fundamentally unfair. It violates every principle of fairness and equity that exists in the law of this country and has existed for over 200 years. That alone is clearly enough that this bill should not be supported. 
   Senator KERRY's amendment addresses that problem. It also addresses another problem that exists with this bill, which is the issue of joint and several liability. I have talked about this once before on the floor, but I think it is really important for the American people to understand what joint and several liability is. Essentially, it has existed in the law of this country for a couple hundred years now. It says that where you have an innocent--as in my example--small businessman and you have multiple parties on the other side who may be responsible for what happened, under joint and several liability the innocent party never has to pay for the loss, 
   that the loss is shared in some way among the parties who are responsible for that loss. In this case, it may be the computer chip manufacturers; it may be the computer company that actually sold the entire system--a whole multitude of defendants. It is for them to resolve who pays what among themselves. In my case, the small businessman is innocent. And, as a result of the current law on joint and several liability, this innocent party is relieved of having to share the loss with guilty parties. 
   That is the reason joint and several liability exists. It is the reason it has existed in law in this country for a long time. 
   Senator KERRY's amendment sets up what I consider to be a very moderate, thoughtful approach--that responds to the computer industry and the high-tech industry's request for some protection against joint and several liability. 
   What Senator KERRY says is basically, if you come in and show you have acted responsibly as a good citizen, you get proportionate liability; that is, you can never be held responsible for anything more than your fair share of the damages. 
   It seems to me, although that is not the law in a great number of States in this country, that is a reasonable approach. It is a compromise. There is no question about that. We all recognize that, while I personally believe joint and several liability makes a great deal of sense, because it essentially says as a matter of policy we are going to always make people who are responsible for the loss share that loss, and never the innocent small businessman pay for the loss. 
   Senator KERRY has attempted to fashion a compromise that provides protection for what I believe to be the great bulk of computer companies that are out there doing business, who have acted responsibly, who can show that  they have been good corporate citizens, and when they do that, then they get proportionate liability, which is what they want. 
   But there is still, I have to say, the most fundamental problem in the McCain-Wyden-Dodd bill, which is the provision about economic losses. Ultimately what it means is, if you can't recover anything but the cost of your computer, we are giving prospective absolute immunity to an industry, not knowing at this point what the losses are going to be for anything except the cost of the computer. It is something we have never done in the history of this country. It would be a remarkable thing to do now. 
   I have to say in response to some remarks I heard from Senator DODD earlier, whom I greatly admire and respect, that he talks at great length about this being a 36-month or a 3-year loss, that there is not some dramatic change in the law, that it is just 3 years. 
   Here is the problem. That 3-year period is going to cover every Y2K loss that occurs because of the nature of this problem. These losses are going to come up quickly, and they are going to occur starting in January of the year 2000, or before. By the end of that 3-year period, the problems will have shown themselves, or they will be gone, or they won't exist at all. 
   When Senator DODD says it is just a 3-year provision, it is a 3-year provision that covers every single Y2K loss that is going to occur. It covers them all. We just have to recognize that when he talks about this being just a 3-year period of time that is being covered, that is what it is. It covers every Y2K loss that may occur. 
   The bottom line is this: I think it makes great sense to have a bill that provides some reasonable protection for the computer industry. I think Senator KERRY's amendment works very hard at doing that. 
   I think there are at least two huge problems with the McCain bill, the most dramatic of which, to me, is that no businessman, no matter what has been done to him, whether he has been lied to, whether he has been the victim of irresponsible conduct, whatever it is, all he or she can ever recover is the cost of the computer, even if he or she has been put out of business. I don't believe the American people would think that is fair. 
   I yield the remainder of my time.

   Mr. EDWARDS. I appreciate the work of the Senator from Oregon. We have talked about this matter a good deal. I appreciate the time spent doing that. 
   We do have a fundamental disagreement. My reading of Section 12 says that people cannot recover economic  losses. I think if you can't recover economic losses as a result of the negligence or intentional acts or misrepresentations by a defendant, then essentially that means all you can ever get is the cost of the computer--even if you have been put out of business. 
   I don't think anybody in America would think that is right, fair, or just. 
   My first question is if, in fact, all the remedies for recovery of economic loss--that is lost profits, et cetera--are left in place under Federal and State law, why do we need a section, Section 12, on that matter at all in this bill?

   Mr. EDWARDS. If the Senator will yield, the problem I have, if it is true that all State and Federal remedies for economic loss are left in place, it seems we would need to say nothing about that in this bill. We could say absolutely nothing and they would remain in place as they are under existing law, or we could have one sentence and that sentence would say ``economic losses are permitted as presently exist under applicable Federal or State law.'' 
   Instead, I have a 2 1/2 page section on economic loss, and before it ever gets to mentioning Federal or State remedies for economic loss, it sets forth a long description of requirements that have to be met--requirements that don't exist in any State or Federal law. 
   The reality is this bill sets up requirements that are far more draconian than exist across this country. Then the amendment says if you can meet all of those requirements, and the recovery of these economic losses are permitted under State and Federal law, then you can recover economic losses. 
   The truth of the matter is, if it were true that economic losses as they presently exist in the law and as they exist across this country--which means people can recover, in my example, more than the cost of their computer; they can recover for lost profits, their overhead, and all the costs associated with that, things that most Americans would consider completely fair, reasonable, and just--if that were true, we do not need a provision about this at all. We sure do not need 2 1/2 pages about it. Or we could do it in one sentence: Existing recoveries for economic losses are permitted under applicable Federal or State law. 
   Instead, we have 2 1/2 pages. We have a provision that 
   essentially eliminates the right to recover economic losses, even in the case of someone who has had a fraudulent representations made to them about the product they are purchasing. 
   Can the Senator show me the specific language that simply says all Federal and State law remains in place, without any other requirements?

   Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, I don't have any problem at all with the idea of protecting existing contracts. I think Senator KERRY's amendment does exactly that. I think the problem we are confronted with--and I have asked this question a couple of times--this 2 1/2 pages on economic loss does not say that State remedies prevail. 
   I might add, I believe your home State of Oregon allows the recovery of economic losses under the circumstances that I am describing where someone has acted irresponsibly. So we have a bill that will change laws not only in other places around the country but in your home State. 
   Let me give you an example of what I am talking about.

   Mr. EDWARDS. For just a moment, if I could just give an example of what I am referring to, let's suppose a computer has been sold by a computer company that sells a system. They have sold it to a small businessman. There is a Y2K problem and the small business is put out of business. They have lost millions of dollars over the course of several months. What we determine, when the investigation is done, is that what caused the problem is a chip, a computer chip that was sold by a manufacturer with whom this purchaser never had any interaction. Or it was some program that was loaded onto the computer. And the plaintiff never had any relation with the software manufacturer. Of course they would not; they bought the computer at a computer store from some computer salesman. 
   Under the provisions of this bill, the person who was actually responsible, that is the manufacturer of the computer chip or software that was not Y2K compliant--you cannot recover against that responsible person for economic losses under the express provisions of this paragraph in Section 12. In fact, the Senator and I both know in reality that is what is most likely to happen. What most people are going to confront when they have a Y2K problem is some very isolated, discrete part of their computer system that caused the problem. It is not going to be the entire system. My point being there is no contract between the purchaser and that responsible party, that party in my example who is acting irresponsibly. 
   What you are doing in this bill is you are absolutely cutting off the right of this innocent businessman to recover anything more than what he has lost, what he has lost out of his pocket, what he has lost as a result of not being able to make sales. This bill is very clear about that, I say to Senator WYDEN. I don't think it can be interpreted in any other way.

   Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, if I can respond just very briefly, there are two fundamental problems I respectfully disagree with Senator WYDEN about. The first of those problems is he talks at great length about State contract law. I do not have any problem with State contract law being totally enforced. I believe the law generally ought to be enforced and that includes State contract law. The problem is in the real world, most of the time, as Senator HOLLINGS pointed out, to the extent there is any written contract that contract is drafted by the manufacturers. It is not drafted by a small businessman who is buying a computer. So the Senator knows as well as I do it is a farce to say there is going to be a provision in the contract that provides for economic losses. It is not going to be anywhere in any contract, because the contracts have been written by teams of lawyers who drafted these contracts to protect the seller. They are the people who are in the position of economic power. 
   So the reality is there is not going to be anything in the written contract if there is a written contract. That is one problem. 
   But there is a second problem that is even larger than that, which is in many cases it is not going to be the contracted-with party who is responsible. The contract is between a purchaser and a seller. The seller is selling a computer system and the negligent or irresponsible party is not the seller who has included many computer chips in his computer system.

   Mr. EDWARDS. If I can finish this thought, the bottom line is in many cases--in fact, in the vast majority of cases--the computer company that is responsible for putting a small businessman out of business, for all the losses that the small businessman incurs is not going to have a contract. In fact, the only way the person who is ultimately responsible can be held accountable is through a cause of action for breach of warranty or breach of product warranty and negligence, and this bill eliminates the right of that small businessman to recover any of his losses other than the cost of the computer. 
   The result of this discussion is Senator WYDEN now recognizes that, and with all due respect, I do not believe the American people will find that fair.

   Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, this amendment expresses the Sense of the Senate that income received by a member of the Armed Forces of the United States while receiving special pay should be tax exempt. 
   Currently, members of the U.S. Armed Forces who serve in a ``combat zone'' receive special tax exemptions. For example, they do not have to pay excise taxes on phone calls that they make from the combat zone. Nor do they have to pay income taxes on the money earned while in that zone. 
   My amendment expresses the Sense of the Senate that the tax exemptions should be triggered when the Secretary of Defense designates his employees as eligible for ``special pay'' based on hostile conditions. Members of the Armed Forces receive special pay under Title 37, United States Code, Section 310 when: (a) subject to hostile fire; (b) on duty in which he, or others with him, are in imminent danger of such fire; (c) were killed, injured or wounded by hostile fire or (d) were on duty in a foreign area in which he was subject to the threat of physical harm or imminent danger on the basis of civil insurrection, civil war, terrorism, or wartime conditions. 
   The original tax exemption for combat pay was put in place during the Korean War. But given the current uses of our Armed Forces, it makes sense to update the provision for soldiers in hostile zones. 
   And I also believe that making this change in the Tax Code would correct an inequity. I think it is only right that soldiers in the Kosovo engagement are receiving the tax exemptions. But during a recent visit to Fort Bragg, many soldiers and their families commented that the same benefits should have been extended to the soldiers who served in Haiti and in Somalia. I have to say that I agreed with them. Indeed, I will introduce legislation after Memorial Day to implement this Sense of the Senate. 
   This Sense of the Senate addresses the new realities of the post-cold war world that repeatedly affects the members of our armed forces and their families. As the Senate knows all too well, the end of the cold war brought with it a significant drawdown in the size of our armed forces and a withdrawal from an overseas based force to one based primarily in the United States. Almost concurrently, our national security strategy has lead us into an era of seemingly continuous deployments. In the 40 years between 1950 and 1990, the U.S. Army was deployed 10 times. In the less than 10 years since the fall of the Berlin Wall, the Army has been deployed 33 times. The Navy's responses have doubled in the 90's. The Air Force has seen its deployed forces rise 400 percent while its active duty personnel dropped 33 percent. Some of these deployments are a few months in duration; some are part of a continuous presence--such as our forces in the Sinai. All work hardship on both the members deployed and their families, particularly when there are repeated or back-to-back deployments. 
   Again, as the Senate well knows these demands are contributing to both recruitment and retention problems. In recognition of these demands and of the likelihood that we will continue to see more of these deployments, this Sense of the Senate recognizes that we need to bring our Tax Code up to date so that it too acknowledges these new realities. 
   As we approach Memorial Day, I ask the Senate to approve this amendment as a means of acknowledging the sacrifices demanded of our service members and their families.

   Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleague, Senator HAGEL, to introduce the Fragile X Research Breakthrough Act of 1999. 
   Most of my colleagues have probably never heard of Fragile X. But it is the leading known cause of mental retardation. And the measure we introduce today could help put us on the path to treat and ultimately, we hope, cure the disorder. This measure will launch a concerted and aggressive federal effort to deal with Fragile X. 
   Fragile X--which is a genetic defect that results in mental retardation--was only recently discovered. Given its prevalence, it's surprising that it took us so long to discover this problem. 
   One in 2,000 males and one in 4,000 females have the gene defect. One in every 260 women is a carrier. Current studies estimate that as many as 90,000 Americans suffer from Fragile X. Yet up to 80 to 90 percent of them are undiagnosed. It does not affect one racial or ethnic group more than another. 
   Scientists have only known exactly what causes Fragile X since 1991. Fragile X occurs when a specific gene, which should hold a string of molecules 
   that repeat six to fifty times, over-expands. It causes the gene to hold anywhere from 200 to 1,000 copies of the same sequence, repeating over and over, much like a record skipping out of control. The result of this error is that instructions needed for the creation of a specific protein in the brain are lost. Consequently, the Fragile X protein is either low or absent in the affected person. The lower the level of the protein, the more severe the resulting disabilities. 
   People with Fragile X have effects ranging from mild learning disabilities to severe mental retardation. Behavioral problems associated with Fragile X include aggression, anxiety, and seizures. The effects on both the victims of the disorder and their families are profound, taking a huge emotional and financial toll. People with Fragile X have a normal life expectancy but usually incur special costs that add up to over $2 million on average over their lifetime. Because it is inherited, many families have more than one child with Fragile X. 
   But although Fragile X is now known in the scientific community, it is still neither widely studied by scientists nor known by the public at large. 
   That's shocking, considering its devastating effect. Let me give you an example. In 1989 Katie Clapp gave birth to her first child, Andy. She and her husband, Dr. Michael Tranfaglia were thrilled. There were some concerns initially because Andy was missing one kidney and had some other medical problems. But they were quickly remedied, and Michael knew from his training as a medical doctor that Andy could do fine with one kidney. Testing did not reveal any other problems, so the couple breathed easy. 
   But soon Andy started showing other signs of problems. He had difficulty feeding and was inconsolable except when held by his mother. He was not as responsive as other children his age, except to scream when put down. Over the first year of life, he began to miss achievement milestones, such as sitting up and walking. Michael was in his residency training at the University of North Carolina hospital, so a  wealth of medical resources were within his reach. Andy was seen by neurologists and geneticists, but there were no answers. 
   When Andy was two years old, Katie became pregnant with a second child. She wanted to be sure that her next baby would be born free of Andy's problems. So Andy was tested some more for genetics abnormalities, but nothing showed up. Yet Andy's problems were becoming more and more apparent, and causing greater difficulties for the family. 
   Finally, when he was three and a half years old, Andy went to a new physician, a developmental pediatrician. During the initial visit with the doctor, Michael and Katie got their first indication that there might be a name for the problem they had been living with. The doctor suggested that Andy be tested for something called Fragile X. The test was performed, and came back positive. Katie Clapp and Michael Tranfaglia soon learned that not only did Andy have this inherited genetic disorder, but that their baby daughter Laura was also afflicted. 
   Recent advances in Fragile X research now make it possible to test definitively for the disorder through DNA analysis. Yet many doctors are still not familiar with Fragile X, and subtle symptoms in early childhood can make it difficult to detect. 
   But there is good news. Because scientists have identified the missing protein that causes the disorder, there is hope for a cure. And because Fragile X is the only single-gene disease known to directly impact human intelligence, understanding the disease can give us insight into human intelligence and learning and into dealing with other single gene defects. Understanding Fragile X may also unlock some of the mysteries of autism, schizophrenia, and other neurological disorders. But we need to fund research efforts into this devastating disease. 
   Mr. President, my proposal seeks to capitalize on the good news. It would: 
   Expand and coordinate research into Fragile X under the direction of the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development--a division of the National Institutes of Health; 
   Establish at least three Fragile X centers, which would receive grants for research and development aimed at improving the diagnosis and treatment of, and finding a cure for, Fragile X; 
   Allow patients with Fragile X to participate in clinical trials; 
   Coordinate activities and exchange of information between the centers for better understanding of the disorder, and 
   Encourage wide scale research into Fragile X by allowing qualified health professionals who conduct research into the disorder to be repaid for principal and interest on educational loans under the National Health Service Corps Loan Repayment Program. 
   Today, in our country, thousands of children have Fragile X, but their parent have never heard of the disease. These parents know something is wrong, but they cannot give the problem a name, and neither can any doctor they have consulted. Like Katie and Michael, they may know their child has a disability, but they do not know why. They do not know that if they have more children, those children may also be at risk. They do not know there are treatments for the problem. 
   They do not know that someone is working on a cure. 
   The same holds true for many adults in our society. They are living in group homes and in institutions around the country. They have been cared for during entire lifetimes by devoted family members. Yet they have never had a diagnosis beyond ``mental retardation.'' 
   This summer in North Carolina, we are hosting a very special gathering of very special people. The Special Olympics World games will begin with an opening ceremony in Raleigh on June 26th, and the Games will run through July 4th. Among the participants will be many athletes who have Fragile X. Some of them know it, but many others, along with their families, do not even know that their particular disorder has a name. And with a name comes knowledge, and with knowledge comes hope for a better future--even for a cure. 
   The job of these extraordinary athletes this summer is to make the most of their abilities and to achieve personal goals and triumphs. Our role in the games is to support their efforts, and to cheer them on. But our responsibility does not end there. It is our responsibility to make the most of the knowledge we now have, to expand that knowledge, and to give these folks the best chance possible. I ask all of my colleagues to join me in supporting this important research. Thank you.

   Mr. EDWARDS. Thank you, Senator HELMS, for allowing me to speak today in a tribute to an extraordinary North Carolinian, Adm. Bud Nance. 
   I found Senator MCCAIN's poem very moving and very touching. I know Bud Nance was an extraordinary friend to my senior Senator, who has been an extraordinary friend to me since I have been here in the Senate. They grew up together. I think they were born a couple of blocks away from each other, over in Monroe, NC, and even a couple of months apart, if I am not mistaken. 
   The things that Bud Nance did with his life are the things we would strive for all of our children to do. He spent his life in service of this country. Having attended the Naval Academy, having gone on to rise to prominence as an admiral in the Navy, having served on the U.S.S. North Carolina, and then, after retirement, when most people would go on to spend time with their family and children, he went to his second career, which was working for his great lifelong friend, Senator HELMS, on the Foreign Relations Committee. 
   While I did not know Bud Nance intimately the way the Senators who have spoken knew him, I have to say, whenever I went to Senator HELMS for advice--which seemed to be often--on issues of foreign relations, the very first thing he would say to me is, you need to talk to Bud Nance. I know how much he relied and depended on Bud Nance. 
   I might add, aside from the fact that I am so proud of Bud Nance as a North Carolinian, I have another connection with him, which is that my father-in-law, Vince Anania, who was a captain in the Navy, went to the Naval Academy and was a classmate of Bud Nance  at the Naval Academy. My father-in-law was a career naval aviator, a man for whom I have great love, admiration, and respect, and he held Bud Nance in enormous esteem and friendship, having gone to school with him, having known him over the years. 
   I have to say, this man's career speaks for itself. The fact that he is held in such high esteem by Capt. Vince Anania, whom I love, admire and respect, just about says it all. I think this man was an extraordinary man who gave extraordinary service to his country. We have lost a great American. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Justice for Western North Carolina Act--legislation that will create an additional permanent district court judgeship and an additional temporary district court judgeship in the Western District of North Carolina. 
   The Western District of North Carolina is one of the most overworked districts in the United States. And it is strained almost to the breaking point. The statistics tell the tale: its judges have the heaviest caseload of all the district courts in the Fourth Circuit. That means of all the district court judges working in Maryland, Virginia, West Virginia, North Carolina, and South Carolina--no other judges have a more crushing workload. Indeed, they deal with a caseload almost twice that recommended for any federal judge. The nonpartisan Judicial Conference of the United States, the principal policymaking body for the federal court system, believes that no judge should handle more than 430 weighted case filings. Well, the judges in the Western District have a weighted filing per judge of 703. 
   The people of western North Carolina feel the impact of this burden. Criminal felony cases take longer to deal with in western North Carolina than any other district in the country but two. And businesses have to wait almost two years to have their lawsuits heard before a jury. Business disputes, Social Security claims, civil rights disputes--all of them are needlessly delayed when we in the Senate fail to fulfill our responsibility to ensure the prompt administration of justice. 
   Three able Western District Court judges are doing their utmost to deal with this deluge. But they need our help. And we have failed to address the need sooner. It has been more than twenty years since Congress authorized the Western District's third judgeship. In 1978, there were 775 raw case filings. Last year, there were more than 7,000. It is folly to think that three judges should be able to handle the nearly tenfold increase in case filings in the Western District. 
   Nor is there any relief from a growing caseload in sight. North Carolina is in the midst of a population boom. Since the 1990 census, the state's population grew by 12%. The Charlotte metropolitan area, which is in the western district of North 
   Carolina, grew by 19 percent since 1990, making it the tenth fastest growing region in the country during this period. This growth in population, business, and industry translates into more commercial, corporate, and criminal law cases. 
   Mr. President, more than any other justice system in the world, ours provides fair and equal administration of justice. We put this at risk when we do not have enough judges. When judges are overworked, they may be unable to give each case the attention it deserves. The maxim that ``justice delayed is justice denied'' is absolutely true. Slow justice does not just affect the litigants. With commercial cases involving major corporations, it can also hurt employees and consumers, as well. Moreover, we cheapen the Constitution when we fail to authorize the resources necessary for the federal judiciary--one of the three, coequal branches of government--to adequately serve society. Congress must respect the principle of an independent federal judiciary by ensuring that federal judges are not so consumed by the backlog of cases that they are not able to give the cases that come before them the attention they deserve. 
   The legislation I propose puts into effect the recent recommendation made by the Judicial Conference. The Judicial Conference works to ensure that the federal judiciary delivers equal justice under law. On March 16 of this year, it recommended that we add one permanent and one temporary judgeship in the Western District of North Carolina. The Chief Justice serves as the presiding officer of the nonpartisan Judicial Conference. The membership of the Conference includes the chief judges of the 13 courts of appeals, a district judge from each of the 12 geographic circuits, and the chief judge of the Court of International Trade. 
   No one, at least no one I know, disagrees that the Western District is overworked. But some people have proposed the misguided solution of eliminating a judgeship from the Eastern District of North Carolina and transferring it to the Western District. I think that eliminating a judge from the Eastern District would be a real mistake, as big a mistake as not creating new judgeships in the Western District. The proposal is simply robbing Peter to pay Paul. 
   Eliminating a judgeship from the Eastern District would leave it in the same painful position that the Western District is in now. Last year, the Eastern District had 2056 weighted filings, or 514 for each of its four judgeships, easily above the 
   national average of 484. Taking away a judgeship from the Eastern District would result in a weighted caseload per judge of 685. Transferring a judgeship from the Eastern to the Western District would do no more than switch the problem from the west to the east. 
   I am also very concerned about the effect this elimination would have on Raleigh and the many people and companies who are based there and depend on the federal judiciary. For the last twenty years, at least one Eastern District judgeship has been filled by a judge presiding in Raleigh. Today, however, the three active judges in the Eastern District reside in Elizabeth City, Greenville, and Wilmington, and most of the Eastern District's court sessions are held in those cities. It is important that those areas have judges, but it is also important that there be a judge in Raleigh. If we transfer the unfilled judgeship to the west, we will do serious harm to our state capital. 
   Raleigh is the home of the main offices of the U.S. Attorney, the Federal Public Defender for the Eastern District, the Clerk of Court, the United States Probation Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation for the Eastern District, and the North Carolina Department of Justice. In addition, many private lawyers who handle civil and criminal cases in the Eastern District come from Raleigh. Finally, the Raleigh metropolitan area, which has more than one million people, is the fifth fastest growing urban area in the nation--swelling by 26 percent since 1990. Eliminating a judgeship based in Raleigh would create unnecessary obstacles to the pursuit of fair administration of justice in that city. 
   Mr. President, the marble facade on the Supreme Court building says, ``Equal Justice Under Law.'' We in the Congress must not jeopardize this principle by failing to provide the judiciary the resources it needs to do its work. Therefore, I urge your support of the Justice for Western North Carolina Act.

   Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, I have a particular situation in my State of North Carolina that I want to make sure is not going to be affected by some of the insurance language in this bill. 
   A few years ago, Blue Cross/Blue Shield of North Carolina was considering converting from non-profit status to for profit. The North Carolina legislature looked into the plan, and decided that if Blue Cross were to convert to for-profit, it should be required to set up a charitable foundation as part of the process. It did so in order to make sure that funding for medical expenses would be available to many North Carolinians who had benefited from the services of the non-profit Blue Cross. During the Banking Committee's consideration of the bill, I was concerned that the earlier insurance language would have preempted the North Carolina law if a bank wanted to affiliate or purchase Blue Cross after the conversion. 
   As a result of the Senator's amendment during the committee markup, the insurance language in the bill now is quite different. But I want to make sure that my concern about the Blue Cross/Blue Shield of North Carolina conversion law is addressed by the new language in S. 900.

   Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Sweepstakes Toll-Free Option Protection Act of 1999, the ``STOP Act.'' I hope this measure will help put a stop to a practice I find extremely troublesome: the flooding of consumers' mailboxes with unwanted and misleading sweepstakes mailings. 
   The Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations recently held hearings on deceptive mailings and sweepstakes promotions. I'd like to thank Senators COLLINS and LEVIN for bringing this important issue to light. 
   Mr. President, during the course of these hearings, it became clear to me that strong measures must be taken to curb the use of misleading sweepstakes promotions. Too many people are getting swamped with solicitations. And too many people are spending their life savings trying to win prizes. The primary victims are our nation's elderly who are led to believe that if they purchase magazine subscriptions or other products, they will increase their chances of winning. 
   Well, purchases do not increase the chances of winning. But often times, what purchases actually do is increase the number of solicitations sweepstakes companies send out to people, encouraging them to buy even more products. With each new purchase, consumers are led to believe that they are coming closer and closer to winning a prize. The sad truth is they are not getting closer, but the cycle of deception keeps going. 
   The legislation I am introducing today would require sweepstakes companies to set up a uniform toll-free telephone number that consumers can call to have their names and addresses removed from all sweepstakes mailing lists. People will no longer have to contact each and every sweepstakes promoter to stop these misleading mailings. 
   My legislation is a sensible approach to helping regular people who want to stop the flood of sweepstakes mailings and protect themselves from misleading solicitations. Let me tell you the story of Bobby Bagwell to help illustrate the need for this measure. 
   One day, Pamela Bagwell went to visit her elderly father-in-law, Bobby. When she arrived at Bobby's home, Pamela found stacks and stacks of solicitations from sweepstakes companies. She asked Bobby about them and found out that he had made numerous purchases thinking that buying products would increase his chances of winning a prize. He was so convinced he would win a prize that he even invited his neighbors to his house on the day that the Publishers Clearing House prize patrol was supposed to deliver the grand prize check. 
   Pamela estimates that Bobby spent more than $20,000 in 10 months on products he thought would help his chance of winning. Now as I mentioned before, Bobby is an elderly man. 
   But this is not the worst part of this story. Bobby also has dementia. Pamela, who has power of attorney for Bobby, contacted Publishers Clearing House at least 6 times in October last year to demand that the company stop sending Bobby solicitations. She even went so far as to send the company a doctor's certification that Bobby has dementia. And yet, the sweepstakes mailings continued to flood Bobby's mailbox. Pamela said that sometimes Bobby was receiving up to twenty per day, from many different companies. 
   During the hearings, I asked representatives from the four major sweepstakes companies, Publishers Clearing House, Time, American Family Enterprises and Reader's Digest, to check their records and remove Bobby's name and address from their mailing lists. All of the companies agreed to do so. However, I find it unacceptable that the only recourse someone like Pamela has is to hope that a United States Senator makes such a request for her. 
   Pamela and Bobby Bagwell's situation is not unique. Since the hearings, my office has received numerous calls and letters, not just from North Carolinians, but from people all over the country who tell similar, disturbing stories about their experiences with sweepstakes companies. Mr. President, my proposal is a reasonable way to help them. 
   I believe that people should have the right to easily put a stop to these mailings. And sweepstakes promoters should be legally required to honor such a request. 
   Now let me tell you how my legislation would work. 
   First, as I have already mentioned, it requires that sweepstakes companies set up a uniform toll-free number that individuals or people with power of attorney for such individuals, can call to get their name and address removed from all sweepstakes mailing lists. After a person places that one phone call, they will receive a removal request form to fill out and send in to the notification system. After the system receives that form, the person's name will be removed from all sweepstakes mailing lists. The form will serve as written evidence that the person made a request to have their name removed. 
   Second, the sweepstakes companies must include a statement in their mailings that people have the option of having their names removed from sweepstakes mailing lists and that they can initiate this process by calling the specific toll-free number that has been established. The statement must be clear and conspicuous, which is important in order to effectively alert people about their right to stop the mailings. 
   Finally, my bill requires that if an individual makes a request to have their name removed from sweepstakes mailings lists, the sweepstakes companies must comply with this request. If the companies continue to send mailings against the wishes of the caller, each mailing will subject the company to a $10,000 civil penalty. 
   Mr. President, in closing, I should mention that the American Association of Retired Persons participated in the sweepstakes hearings and testified as to ``the severe effects'' deceptive sweepstakes mailings have on AARP members. AARP supports my idea of a toll-free uniform notification system. 
   My legislation is a common sense solution to a growing problem, and I am confident that it will indeed go a long way toward stopping harrassing, deceptive sweepstakes mailings.

   Mr. EDWARDS. Thank you. 
   I am wondering, Senator BAYH, if you have had the same experience I have had. That is, I come from a State with many banks, including some of the largest banks in America, Bank of America being one. And having had many conversations with representatives of banks that are headquartered in my State, what I hear from them is, in fact, they enjoy participating in the Community Reinvestment Act. They take great pride in the work they do in the communities where they are located. They have absolutely no opposition to the Community Reinvestment Act and, in fact, do not oppose the Community Reinvestment Act provisions of the Democratic substitute offered by Senator SARBANES. 
   I am just curious whether the banks in your State of Indiana have had the same kind of reaction.

   Mr. EDWARDS. I want to address that in just a moment. I want to say, first, in relation to the remarks of my friend, the Senator from Indiana, who has become a very close friend and colleague of mine during our tenure--we came to the Senate together--that I am proud of what he had to say. I completely agree with everything he had to say, and his remarks particularly about turning back the clock on this very, very important piece of legislation ring true with me and I think ring true with most Americans. 
   Mr. President, if I may, there is a really critical thing I want Americans, who are listening to this debate, to understand. This is not some obscure piece of banking legislation that has nothing to do with their lives. 
   It is really important for Americans to understand that this bill--I refer now to Senator GRAMM's bill--that this bill will have, or has the potential to have, a dramatic effect on the lives of every American, not just the poor, not just minorities, not just the elderly, not just those who run a small business or want to get into the family farming business, and not just those people who are directly impacted by the Community Reinvestment Act. 
   This bill has the potential to affect every single one of us, every single American. And here is why. Because it weakens the Community Reinvestment Act. Because of CRA, we provide low-income housing, we provide single-family housing, we give families a place to live, we give small businessmen and women, minority and otherwise, a chance to engage in entrepreneurship, to open their own business. We give the people the opportunity, in my home State of North Carolina, to start a small farm, and expand that farm. 
   Every time we provide these kinds of economic opportunities to people, every time we give families, core families, a chance to live together, to stay together, and not be spread out, we do a number of things: No. 1, we reduce crime; No. 2, we create pride, an extraordinary amount of self-esteem that may not have existed before; and we give people an opportunity to do something they otherwise might not be able to do--own their own home or open their own business. 
   I speak to every American when I say, crime, core family values, the fact that the folks who benefit directly from the Community Reinvestment Act are folks that we may otherwise, as a Government, have to support, these are things that affect every American. This bill is not some obscure banking bill that has nothing to do with people's lives. 
   The Community Reivestment Act has a dramatic effect and has had a dramatic effect on every single American. I think it is critically important for people to understand that. 
   I think it is also important for them to understand what exactly Senator GRAMM's bill does to the existence of the Community Reinvestment Act. I have heard the bill described by him and others as being ``Community Reinvestment Act neutral,'' as to the overall purposes of this legislation. 
   I might add parenthetically that I strongly support the idea that banks ought to be able to expand services and affiliate with other financial institutions. They ought to be able to sell insurance. They ought to be able to sell securities. It is good for banks. We have a lot of banks in my State that need to do this and want to do it and, I think, ought to be able to do it. It is also good for consumers because it creates competition, and it is a good thing for consumers to have access to these services when they go to their banks. I strongly support those opportunities. 
   Here is the problem. Under existing law, when a bank seeks to expand, either by merger or by opening a branch, then its CRA rating is one of the things that is taken into consideration. Under the provision that is proposed by Senator GRAMM, when a bank seeks to expand services by affiliating with a company that sells insurance, by affiliating with a company that sells securities, CRA, or the Community Reinvestment Act, plays no role whatsoever. 
   Let me say this in the simplest terms. A bank with a completely unsatisfactory Community Reinvestment Act rating that has been determined by regulators to not be complying with the law, to not be doing what it should be doing with respect to investing in its community, I am talking about a totally noncompliant bank, that factor cannot even be taken into consideration in determining whether that bank should be allowed to sell insurance and whether it should be allowed to sell securities. 
   This bill, Senator GRAMM's bill, is not CRA neutral for one simple reason. We are, by virtue of this law, expanding what banks can do, allowing them to sell insurance, allowing them to sell securities. If we don't take CRA, which presently applies to applications for branching and mergers, and apply it as a precondition for these new services they are going to engage in, then we have withdrawn from CRA. We will have cut the underpinnings from CRA. It is something we shouldn't do--it is fundamental--we shouldn't do. CRA compliance ought to be a consideration when banks seek to engage in the expanded services permitted under this bill in exactly the same way, in exactly the same fashion that it presently applies to their attempts to merge with other banks or to their attempts to open other branches. 
   Now, I want to show a couple of examples with the indulgence of my colleagues. 
   I want to show a couple examples of what the Community Reinvestment Act has done in North Carolina. I show now a photograph of a neighborhood, an economically disadvantaged neighborhood, a minority neighborhood in Durham, NC. This is a house that existed in that neighborhood. 
   As a result of the Community Reinvestment Act, and as a result of a bank partnering with local community groups, this house that we have just taken a look at was turned into this house. 
   If I could hold up the first photo just a minute, this was a crime-ridden, drug-infested community. As a result of the Community Reinvestment Act, we went from this to this--a place that the people who occupy this home are proud of; a low-income family was able to reside there. They take pride in their community. And as Reverend Brooks, who was part of this effort, said:  
   Before, there were drug dealers sitting on this corner. Now, we have homeowners hoping to be in these houses.  
   The Community Reinvestment Act. It changes communities. It changes families. It changes people's lives. It also changes the 
   financial obligations that the rest of us, as Americans, have to support opportunities for people who want to support themselves. They just need a chance. What the Community Reinvestment Act does is, it gives those folks a chance. 
   I want to show one last photo. We have seen one house. This is a neighborhood. This is located in Durham, NC. This is a neighborhood that, again, has gone from a high-crime, drug-dealers-on-the-street-corner neighborhood to a model community. Can you imagine the difference between the way a family feels when they live in a community where right outside their doorstep people are selling drugs and all the houses are in terrible shape versus how they feel when they find themselves in a community that looks like this? Now they take pride in their community. The children growing up in this community take pride in where they live. It gives them a sense of self-esteem. It allows them an opportunity to have pride in themselves and their family that they otherwise might not have. 
   Now, there are some simple facts that I will speak to briefly that have emerged from the progress of the Community Reinvestment Act during the time it has been in place. If I could have the appropriate chart, please. 
   First of all, just since 1993, the private sector lending in low- and moderate-income areas, which is what we have been concerned with, has risen.  From 1993, I guess this is the number of loans, 185,014 to 268,463 in 1997. Over a period of 4 years, there is an increase of 45 percent, almost a 50-percent increase in just 4 years, as a result of the Community Reinvestment Act. 
   The argument is made that--and we have heard a lot of it from Senator GRAMM over the course of the last 45 minutes to an hour--that the Community Reinvestment Act places an enormous regulatory burden on banks, unfairly so. 
   Well, I think, unfortunately, with all due respect to Senator GRAMM, the facts do not bear that argument out. What we find is that among CRA-covered institutions, when they make an application, for example, when a bank decides they are going to merge with another bank, when a bank decides they are going to expand and open a branch, and therefore they file a CRA application, 99 percent of those applications are never even challenged by community groups. So we start with a base of 99 percent where there is no challenge whatsoever. I would love the comments of Senator SARBANES on this in a moment, if he will. It is my understanding that the banks are not required to keep additional information as a result of this expansion of services. In fact, I think they use exactly the same base data that they kept previously. Is that correct, Senator SARBANES? 
</TEXT>
</DOC>

<DOC>
<DOCNO>106-edwards-nc-11-19990505</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. EDWARDS. That is my understanding. 
   So we start with this basic idea that 99 percent of all the CRA-covered applications are not challenged at all. Then of the ones that are challenged, in only 1 percent of those cases are the applications denied. So 1 percent are challenged versus 99 percent that are not, and of that 1 percent, only 1 percent of those are denied. 
   I think the facts prove that CRA has not been an enormous regulatory burden and that banks, as has been the experience of Senator BAYH, as has been the experience of Senator DODD in Connecticut, and as has been my experience in talking to my bankers in North Carolina, the reality is they do not oppose the Community Reinvestment Act. They simply do not. 
   As the quote from Hugh McColl indicated earlier, banks take great pride in their opportunities to invest in their community. Our banks are good corporate citizens who do what they do because they take pride in it. They believe in the Community Reinvestment Act. They support it. They are not opposed to it. 
   Finally, this chart depicts what CRA has done in loans to low- and moderate-income communities. This is as of 1997, $34 billion in small business loans. I think it is really important that we understand we are not just talking about housing. We are talking about small businesses, entrepreneurs who want to get started and just need a leg up, giving them a chance to develop their own business, $34 billion as a result of the Community Reinvestment Act; $18.6 billion in community development, the kind of community development that we saw photographs of just a few moments ago; and critically important to my State of North Carolina--and I suspect Senator BAYH's State of Indiana--$11 billion in small farm loans. 
   That is $11 billion going to small farmers as a result of the Community Reinvestment Act. 
   Here is what we have. We have a bill that makes a great deal of sense on the whole. We want to expand the services of banks. We believe--at least I believe--that banks ought to be able to engage in those services. But it is critically important that we maintain the viability and the vitality of the Community Reinvestment Act. It is important that we maintain it for a lot of reasons: because we need to support minorities; we need to support the elderly; we need to support low-income families; we need to support people who need or want to start their own small business or their own family farm. It makes good business economic sense for the country. 
   But what I want the American people to hear from me today, if they hear nothing else, is that this is not some obscure piece of banking legislation that is technical or difficult to understand. This legislation can affect their lives and, in fact, will affect the lives of every American every day because to the extent that we keep poor families together, to the extent that we reduce crime in this country, to the extent that we give people an opportunity to seek out good employment, to get jobs to support their own families--all those things that we as Americans believe in--when we do those things in conjunction, we as a country benefit. And to the extent that we look at it selfishly, we as individuals benefit because those people will not be supported by the Government. They won't be supported by taxpayers. They will support themselves. And the reality is that is exactly what they want. They want the opportunity to support themselves and to know the pride of homeownership. That is what community reinvestment is all about. That is the reason Senators SARBANES, KERRY, BAYH, DODD, and myself believe in it so deeply.

   Mr. EDWARDS. I think that is a wonderful indication, as the Senator put it, of the people on the ground, on the spot, seeing what is happening on a day-to-day basis, recognizing how critically important CRA is to this country. They see what is happening. I think it goes hand in hand with the fact that the banks--and I might add, I take great pride in the fact that every bank in North Carolina has a satisfactory CRA rating, every single one of them--are helping make a difference. 
   I think the fact that the mayors are behind it, the fact that the community  groups are behind it, the fact that the banks themselves, the financial institutions, are behind it, I think all these things in combination go to prove a very simple point: The Community Reinvestment Act has been good for America. It is good for the specific groups it directly benefits, and it is good for all of us as Americans because it allows these folks to support themselves, which is what they want to do.

   Mr. EDWARDS. I thank the Senator for his kind comments. He and I share the same feelings about each other. We share a lot of the same beliefs and values. There is no question that in the State of North Carolina we have had the same experience they have had in Indiana, which is that the Community Reinvestment Act, in fact, reaches out into rural, underserved communities, to small farmers, small businesses and communities that are chronically and economically disadvantaged and so desperately need its help. I think it is another example of how well the CRA has worked.

   Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, let me say to my friend, the Senator from Oregon, that I have great respect for him. He knows that. He has spent a tremendous amount of time and work on this project, along with Senator MCCAIN, for whom I also have tremendous respect, along with my great and dear friend, Senator DODD from Connecticut. All three have spent a tremendous amount of time on this issue. 
   I will say at the outset that, from my perspective, I do believe we need to provide the kind of support and help for the high-tech community in this country that it so richly deserves. It is a critical issue not only in Oregon but also in North Carolina. We take great pride in our high-tech community, particularly in the Research Triangle area of North Carolina. My problem is that I don't think this bill strikes a proper balance. I think it fails to do so in a number of ways. I will candidly admit that I am not fully familiar with some of the discussions and negotiations going on right now. We will have to see the final product. I only have the bill as it is before us now to discuss. 
   First, I think there is an enormous problem in doing at least one of the things that this bill does, which is to relieve, in some ways, businesses and corporations from accountability or responsibility, particularly in a day and age when we as Americans are saying to our children, to our families, that they need to be responsible for what they do. We need to be personally responsible and accountable for everything we do. 
   How do we say to the children and families of America that they are accountable and responsible, fully, for everything they do, while at the same time passing legislation in the Congress of the United States saying that a particular slice of corporate America is not fully accountable and responsible for what it does? I think the reality is that it sends a terrible message to our children and to our families. I think what they want to hear from us is that every American, every child, woman, family, parent and every business is, in fact, fully accountable and responsible for what they do, because we as Americans believe in personal responsibility and accountability. 
   Now, I want to talk about a couple of things by way of background. First, we are tinkering here with a civil jury system that has existed in this country for over 200 years. Whenever you tinker around the margins with a system with checks and balances, which has been at work for a long period of time, you create an enormous potential for trouble. 
   That is exactly what this bill does. 
   The argument is made on behalf of this bill that it will decrease litigation, that it will help with this anticipated but still fictional litigation explosion. 
   The reality is that bill creates a morass of potential litigation. It creates new terminology. It creates new definitions, and it has descriptions of legal avenues that can be pursued that have not existed heretofore. 
   The jury system that we have in this country has been developed over a long period of time. There are many trial and appellate decisions that we can rely on and depend on. 
   This bill creates a whole new genre of litigation and appellate decisions. There will be enormous fights over some of the language in this bill. More importantly, one of the things this bill does is it dilutes the jury system. The reality is, if you believe in democracy, you believe in the jury system, because the jury system is nothing but a microcosm of democracy. 
   Speaking for myself, and I think speaking for most Americans, I have tremendous faith--in fact, I would go so far as to say I have a boundless faith--in the Americans who sit on juries all over this country every day who render justice and render fair decisions, fair to both sides, in any litigation. This bill dilutes the responsibility that we give those Americans. 
   I personally have more confidence in regular Americans, North Carolinians, farmers, bankers, people who work in stores, people who are engaged in all walks of life, who come in and sit on the jury, hear cases, and do what they think is right. I have more confidence in them than I do in us as a body trying to impose upon them what we think is fair and just across the board. Those juries hear the facts; they hear the circumstances from both sides, and they render justice. They do what they think is fair and right. 
   Anybody, as I said earlier, who believes and has confidence in Americans who sit on those juries, knows that the decisionmaking should stay right where it is--with the jury. 
   Let me talk for just a minute about this Y2K problem, because this is not a new problem. The history of this problem is, I think, greatly educational in terms of where we are. 
   If I could look at a chart, the title of this chart is ``Y2K. Why do today what you can put off 'til tomorrow?" 
   This is not a new problem. 
   I might add that, along with Senators DODD and BENNETT, I also serve on the Y2K committee. We have learned a great deal through the hearings that have taken place on that committee. 
   For example, in 1960, Robert Bemer, who was a pioneer in computer sciences, advocated the use of a four-digit rather than a two-digit date format. This is now 39 years ago--almost 40 years ago. One of the pioneers of American computer science said it is an enormous mistake to go to a two-digit system instead of a four-digit system. 
   In 1979, he wrote again, the same Robert Bemer, in a computer publication about the inevitable Y2K problems, unless this defect is remedied. He warned, ``Don't drop the first two digits. The program may well fail from an ambiguity in the year 2000.'' 
   We have known about it for 40 years. 
   In 1979, 20 years ago, he is telling the industry you have to do something about this, and you have to do something about it now. 
   In 1983, an early Y2K-fix software was marketed and sold in this country which dealt with the Y2K problem. How many copies of that software were sold? Two copies of this software that addressed this problem were sold. 
   In 1984, just 1 year later, ``Computerworld'' magazine said, ``The problem you may not know you have,'' and they warned companies to start making modifications now--in 1984, 15 years ago. 
   In 1986, there was a publication by another computer magazine where IBM asserted:  
   ``IBM and other vendors have known about this problem for many years. This problem is fully understood by IBM software developers who anticipate no difficulty in programming around it.''  
   Then in 1988, the National Institute of Standards and Technology said, ``NIST highly recommends that four-digit year elements be used''--11 years ago. 
   In 1989, the Social Security Administration's computer experts found that the overpayment recoupment systems did not work for dates after 2000, and realized that 35 million lines of code had to be reviewed. 
   Finally, in 1996, Senator MOYNIHAN requested the Congressional Research Service report on Y2K. It predicted widespread massive failures. He introduced legislation to create a special office for Y2K problems and to establish compliance deadlines. It died in committee. 
   Finally, in 1999, this year, Bill Gates blamed Y2K on those who ``love to tell tales of fear.'' At the same time, Microsoft was still shipping products that were not Y2K compliant. 
   My point is a simple one. This Y2K problem has been around for 40 years. Those folks who are involved in this business have known about it. The truth is that many of the people involved in the computer industry have worked hard at correcting this problem. They have addressed it in a very responsible way. Those people will have no liability and no responsibility from any failures that occur. 
   The people who I think make up a great deal of the high-tech industry, who have acted responsibly, who have recognized that this is a problem, who have gone out to the people who they  have sold their products to, and done everything in their power to correct this problem, those people have no responsibility. Under the current legal system, they have absolutely no responsibility. They can't be held responsible. 
   The people who can be held responsible are those who have known about this problem for 40 years and have done nothing to correct it, and, in fact, over the course of the last few years have continued to sell products that are not Y2K compliant, and are not concerned about the result. They have their product sold. They have their money in, and they have let the people who bought the product worry about the problem, or it would be dealt with later. 
   We have no business in this Senate providing protection for people who have engaged in that kind of behavior. That is exactly what this bill does. 
   It has a number of problems in it. Let me just talk about a few of them briefly. 
   First, my friend, the Senator from Oregon, mentioned a few minutes ago that he thought it was important for punitive damages that we be able to send a powerful message to those who had acted irresponsibly and recklessly. 
   This bill places enormous limits on punitive damages that can be awarded, punitive damages that under existing law--if this bill never goes anywhere, never passes, never becomes law, as I stand here today, businesses can only be held accountable for punitive damages if they have engaged in reckless, egregious, willful, sometimes criminal, conduct. It is the only circumstance in which a business can be held liable for punitive damages. 
   My friend, the Senator from South Carolina, who just joined us, is fully aware of that. We have an existing law that provides that protection. 
   ``Joint and several liability'' are terms that lawyers use regularly. But they are critically important terms. The terminology that we hear used by my friend, Senator DODD, and Senator WYDEN, is ``proportionate liability.'' It is very important for the American people to understand what this bill will do to them if it passes. 
   Let me give an example. A small business man--say a grocery store owner--buys a computer system that is necessary to run his business on a day-to-day basis. This is a family business. The system fails. As a result of the system failing, he is unable to keep his doors open over a period of 2, 3, or 4 months. All of these businesses operate on very short-term cash flow. They need money, and they need it on a daily basis. If they don't have it because the computer fails, they get run out of the business. 
   So we have this family-owned grocery store that has been run out of business because their computer system didn't work. Keep in mind, we are talking about a regular American who runs a business. These are not computer experts. They are not experts in lawsuits and litigation. They don't know what they are supposed to do. 
   In my example, they discover that three different companies participated in making their computer system. So they bring an action against those three companies to recover for the cost of what happened with their system and for the fact they have now been put out of business. Any fair-minded American would say if these companies knew about the problem, knew they had sold them a product that was defective, they ought to be held responsible for that. 
   Joint and several liability says each one of those companies can be held liable and responsible for what happened to this family grocery store. This bill says if for some reason one of those three companies is out of business, you can't collect against the other two. Maybe one of the three is an offshore company--which will be true on many occasions with respect to this kind of case--and you can't reach it. Then, because of this bill, you can't reach the other two. This bill says the innocent grocery store owner bears that share of the responsibility. 
   Joint and several liability, which has existed in this country for 200 years, exists for a very simple reason: It is just, and it is fair. We have a choice: Somebody is going to suffer this damage. Should the cost of this damage be paid by the absolutely innocent grocery store owner? Or should it be paid and shared by the defendants who were guilty? It is that simple. It is the guilty on one side, the innocent on the other. 
   The question is, Who is going to share in paying for the damage that has been done? Joint and several liability says that responsibility is borne by the guilty and is never to be borne by the innocent. That is the reason that system has existed. 
   This bill, first of all, essentially eliminates joint and several liability as a starting place. Then it sets up a complex--I am a lawyer and I can barely understand what it says--exception which creates certain circumstances where this grocery store owner can make an effort to collect some of his money from the other defendants if, in fact, there is an uncollectible defendant. But he has to jump through lots of hoops and he has to do it in 6 months, which is the time limitation. Having been in the trenches for 20 years doing these cases, it is almost an impossible task to finish the process of trying to collect in 6 months. 
   The bottom line is, it creates a very narrow exception and puts the burden entirely on the innocent party to jump through these hoops. It makes absolutely no sense. The system that exists in America and has existed for 200 years exists for a good reason. It has been fair and just for 200 years. It is fair and just now. There is absolutely no reason to change it. It makes no sense to change it. 
   Let me use the chart that my friend, Senator LEAHY, referred to earlier--and he did a beautiful job of that. Across the top of this chart is the present justice system. I want to emphasize for Americans who are listening that no computer company or high-tech company can be held responsible under existing law unless they have acted negligently or irresponsibly. 
   Under this jury system that we have in this country today, we 
   have a very simple process. We go through the process of making a claim and seeing if they respond to the claim. If they don't, a lawsuit is filed, the case is eventually heard, and there is a result. Or, on the other hand, as happens in almost 99 percent of the cases, if the company recognizes that the problem was their responsibility, they pay for it. They settle the case, because they know they have a responsibility to pay for what they caused. So we have a quick, fair settlement or we have a fair trial. We have a system that is in place and has existed for 200 years and systems that work State by State. 
   I have to add to this, I don't know why we as a Senate and as a Congress think we are so much smarter than our State legislatures that have passed laws over many years and have court systems that deal with these problems. They are fully capable of addressing this problem. I personally believe if this were an issue, it could easily be addressed at the State level. 
   The reality is, the existing system that we have will work. It is simple. It is streamlined. And it will get a fair result for everyone concerned. 
   On the other hand, if we enact this morass that I have in my hand right now, what we will have is the biggest mess anybody has ever seen in the court system. First of all, all the cases are going to go to Federal court instead of State court. The National Judicial Conference has said the Federal judicial system is already overburdened before they ever get these cases. They don't have enough resources; they don't have enough judges. What we are about to do is dump an enormous pile of new cases in the Federal judicial system which they don't want and which they don't have the resources to handle. 
   We start this complicated process, and without going through all the details--Senator LEAHY has outlined it beautifully--it is one roadblock after another to the innocent party, the grocery store owner, the guy who was put out of business because his computer system wouldn't work and he had nothing to do with it. Every time he moves, he runs into another roadblock. He doesn't have the resources to fight this battle. It is a long and tortuous process that ultimately makes no sense. 
   We have a system that works. There is no reason to do this. 
   Let me give an example of problems we create in a bill like this. There is a provision in this bill that says in any lawsuit a defendant can raise Y2K as a  defense. If you have one business suing another business for a contract--no matter what the claim is about; it could be about anything--and the defendant says, wait a minute, this is a Y2K computer problem, all of a sudden you have triggered enormous, procedural, bureaucratic hurdles that have to be jumped through. The case goes into Federal court. We have this big mess. A tool has been created to complicate a simple lawsuit that could be over and resolved in very simple fashion. 
   I don't suggest for a minute that the people who crafted this bill don't have the very best intentions. I believe they do. I myself--and I only speak for myself--have no problem with the idea that we ought to try to provide incentives for people who are engaged in disputes to resolve those disputes. Alternative dispute resolution, I think, is fine. 
   A cooling off, some period when these folks can talk to each other and try to work it out is fine. I think, if there is a problem, we want to promote discussion between the innocent person who bought the computer system and the people who make it. I think we want to do all of those things. Those are laudable goals. The problem is what we have here is an extremist version of a bill that takes away rights of the innocent party and creates enormous hurdles to that innocent party ultimately recovering. 
   I might add, I think this is unintentional. But the proposal makes the recovery of economic losses virtually impossible. Here is the reason. When I say economic losses, for example in my grocery store story, the recovery of the cost of the computer would not be considered an economic loss. But the fact that these folks have been put out of business and their grocery store is not in business anymore and they have lost the profits they would have made in their grocery store for X number of years, all because of an irresponsible computer maker that would be an economic loss. Well, in order to recover those economic losses that they had nothing to do with--they are totally innocent--in order to recover for those injuries, they have to have a written contract, or a contract that says they can recover under the terms of this bill. 
   Think about that. Use a little common sense here. How many Americans, small business men, who go out and buy a computer system have been thinking about: Well, I better make sure I have a written contract that says if my computer system fails I can recover my losses, my economic losses--my lost sales, my lost profits as a result? The reality is, to the extent there is any contract other than a handshake or walking in the store and buying the computer system, the contracts are drafted by the manufacturers, because they are the ones with the lawyers, a big team of lawyers. They draft these contracts. If anything, they are only signed by the purchasers. So the likelihood that these contracts are going to have any provision in them for the recovery of economic losses is almost nonexistent. 
   The bottom line is this. I think the intention of my colleagues, Senator MCCAIN, Senator WYDEN, Senator DODD--I have absolutely no doubt their intentions are only the best. They want to do exactly what they say they want to do, which is to create incentives for these high-tech companies to correct these problems and not to create, from their perspective, a morass of litigation. 
   The problem is this bill does not do that. I spent many years in the trenches, in courtrooms, fighting these battles. I can respectfully say that I have read the entire bill. It has numerous problems, including some of the ones I have described today. But I do believe we could fashion a bill, I say to Senator MCCAIN, who has just arrived--fashion a bill that would accomplish some of the things they want to accomplish, which is instead of going straight to litigation, have folks talking to one another, working out the problem, curing the problems with the computers. That is in everybody's best interests. I want that. I think all of us here in the Senate want that. 
   But it is my belief, having studied this bill and having studied it carefully--and I will concede I have not seen the most recent discussions because I don't think they have been put in writing yet--but the version we have before us now is completely unacceptable and creates many more problems than it cures. Instead of reducing litigation, I think in fact it creates a vehicle for not only trial litigation but appellate litigation that will go on for many years to come.

   Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to this Republican lockbox for two very basic reasons: No. 1, it does nothing to extend the solvency of Social Security which we all, as Americans, ought to be concerned about; No. 2, the so-called lockbox is really no lockbox at all; it does not provide the protection we need. 
   First, let me speak to this issue of the extension of the financial viability of Social Security. We know from projections that Social Security's financial viability is expected to last through the year 2034. This proposal does nothing to extend that time. It adds no funds to the Social Security fund at all. We have a very fundamental problem. This is not pocket money we are talking about; this is money that elderly Americans all over this country and in North Carolina depend on for their livelihood. 
   For example, over 90 percent of Americans over the age of 65 depend on Social Security and receive Social Security benefits. Nine out of ten elderly Americans who have escaped poverty as a result of Government or Federal help have done so as a result of Social Security. In my home State of North Carolina, over half of the elderly would be in poverty--54 percent--in the absence of Social Security. 
   I have a simple question and I think it is a question the American people ask: What will happen when the year 2034 arrives and these folks can no longer receive their Social Security payments? We made a promise to these people. They spent their lives working, doing exactly what they were obligated to do, paying their payroll taxes. Now the question is whether we, as a government, are going to meet our promise and our responsibilities to them. 
   There is a second fundamental problem with this proposal. The lockbox is really no lockbox at all. It is a lockbox with lots of keys. The problem is, those keys are in the hands of folks who in the past have shown a willingness to let Social Security go to the side and instead use the money for tax cuts and other such things. What we need is a real lockbox, a lockbox that cannot be opened, a lockbox that does not have a provision, as this bill does, that provides for Social Security reform. This lockbox can be opened. 
   The elderly Americans need to know this Social Security money is, in fact, locked. We need to do what is necessary to accomplish that. We have an obligation to our elderly Americans. We made them a promise. They fulfilled their part of that obligation. 
   There is a fundamental question. If we are going to lock up this Social Security money, we need to lock it up in the correct way, in a way that it can't be reached. We need to do what is necessary to extend the life of Social Security. We have an obligation to do that. We have an obligation not to undermine the integrity of the Social Security system. We need to meet our promise and our obligation to elderly Americans who spent their whole lives working, expecting they would receive these benefits when they retired. 
   I yield back the remainder of my time.

   Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the ``Terry Sanford Commemoration Act of 1999.'' This measure would name the federal building in Raleigh, North Carolina after a great man, Terry Sanford. 
   We lost Terry Sanford almost a year ago. The loss was great. He served North Carolina throughout his entire life. He was a Governor, a state Senator, a U.S. Senator, and a university president . He was trained as a lawyer. He wrote books, served as a paratrooper during World Was II, worked as an FBI agent and ran for President of the United States--twice. 
   Senator Sanford died on April 18, 1998 after a long fight with esophageal cancer. 
   He was a towering figure, a hero, to many North Carolinians. And we miss him. 
   There is no doubt that when the history of North Carolina in the 20th Century is written, Terry Sanford will occupy many pages. And he will be given a great deal of credit for the great strides taken by North Carolina. Whatever Terry Sanford touched he made better. 
   Senator Sanford's mother was a school teacher. His love of education must have started there. When he was governor he did whatever it took to increase funding for education. He even talked state legislators into voting for a food tax in order to fund education--that was not easy. Among other things, he helped found the North Carolina School for the Arts which was a pioneer, and to this day remains a leader in arts education. After he finished his term as governor, he became President of Duke University. And he brought unparalleled ambition, vision and energy to making Duke University great. 
   But the list of Senator Sanford's accomplishments does not stop with education. He launched innovative anti-poverty programs. He helped start the North Carolina State Board of Science and Technology. He was largely responsible for the creation of an environmental health sciences facility in Research Triangle Park. He helped calm the student protests over the Vietnam War. 
   And finally, in the midst of a turbulent and difficult time, Terry helped us find a path across the racial divide. In his 1961 inaugural address, he let us know and understand that ``no group of our citizens can be denied the right to participate in the opportunities of first-class citizenship.'' 
   He later said: ``The most difficult thing I did was the most invisible thing. That was to turn the attitude on the race.'' He turned the attitude in small and large ways. He invited prominent leaders in the African-American community to the Governor's Mansion for breakfast to talk about how to solve the race problem. Many of them later said that they never dreamed a day would come when their state's governor would invite them to breakfast. He started the Good Neighbor Council, which is now the North Carolina Human Relations Commission, to give structure and authority to his commitment to creating jobs for people regardless of race. 
   And the thing about Senator Sanford is that he never stopped. Late in life, when he was no longer a Senator, University President or Governor, he kept coming up with great ideas and kept working to see them through to completion. He was a friend to me. And I valued his advice and counsel. 
   Naming a building can never capture the spirit and heart of a man like Terry Sanford. But it is a fitting tribute.

   Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, the order we intend to follow to speak on this resolution will be myself first, followed by the Senator from Nebraska, Mr. HAGEL, Senator MOYNIHAN will speak next, followed by Senator REID from Nevada. 
   Mr. President, this resolution is supported by all Senators, other than Senator KERREY. 
   I will talk for just a moment about how I got to know Senator KERREY and what I have learned about him. Senator KERREY and I first met about 2 years ago when I was looking for a new job, the job that I presently have as U.S. Senator from North Carolina. At the time, Senator KERREY was the head of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. I came here to Washington to meet with Senator KERREY and was grilled by him on why I was seeking this office, what my motivations were, and why I thought I should be able to represent the people of North Carolina in this esteemed body. 
   Over the course of brief time through campaigning and spending lots of time together, we have gotten to know each other very well. He is the definition of a leader, in my mind. Here is a man who is independent, clear thinking, always willing to speak his mind regardless of the politics, willing to speak against his own political party if he believes that his position is right and just, who cares a great deal and empathizes for the plight of others. 
   He has done an extraordinary job during the time I have seen him work here in the Senate during the brief time that I have been here. He is the kind of Senator who many of us young Senators would like to emulate. 
   I want to talk for just a minute about the events that give rise to this resolution. Thirty years ago this past Sunday, Senator KERREY, when he was a Navy SEAL, commanded a unit of Navy SEALs that were involved in an attack on the Vietcong. His unit scaled a 350-foot shear cliff in order to position themselves for the attack. 
   During the course of the attack on the Vietcong, a grenade exploded at the feet of Senator KERREY. He was severely injured by the grenade, but in spite of these severe injuries, which eventually led to the loss of a part of his leg, he continued to direct the attack in a clear-thinking way that eventually led to victory by this Navy SEAL team. 
   The work he did on that day was extraordinarily courageous and showed the leadership that we have come to know over the last 30 years since that event occurred. He went from that event to winning the Medal of Honor for the events that occurred on that day, and from that place to a veterans hospital in Philadelphia for a long, long period of recuperation. 
   I will first read the last sentence of that citation that he received at the time he received his Medal of Honor, which I think encapsulates what Senator KERREY did 30 years ago this past Sunday. 
   KERREY's courageous and inspiring leadership, valued fighting spirit, and tenacious devotion to duty in the face of almost overwhelming opposition sustain and enhance the finest traditions of the United States Naval service.  
   The courage and leadership that Senator KERREY showed on that day, as I mentioned earlier, led to his receipt of the Medal of Honor. From there, he went to a veterans hospital in Philadelphia for a long, long period of recuperation and, as he has told many of his friends and colleagues, it was a very difficult time for him. He went from there to becoming a successful businessman, and he eventually became Governor of Nebraska. That led to the time he has spent here in the U.S. Senate. 
   As I mentioned, Senator KERREY is a man who most of us look up to; he is clear thinking and independent minded. The thing that always inspires me about him is his willingness to speak up even when speaking up is not always in his best political interest or in the best political interest of his party. He, as I mentioned, is the definition of a leader. 
   I want to mention one quote that I think is critically important in understanding the kind of leadership that Senator KERREY has brought to this body during the time he has been here. It is a quote that he gave recently to a Nebraska newspaper:  
   It's odd to say, but this all became a real gift in many ways.  
   Speaking now of the events that occurred 30 years ago this past Sunday and the injuries he received as a result:  
   It's odd to say, but this all became a real gift in many ways. The world got bigger to me. I didn't realize there was so much pain in the world. Up until then, I presumed that if I didn't feel it, then it wasn't happening. But it's going on out there every day. In hospitals. In lots of homes. 
   I learned that the most valuable, priceless thing you can give anyone is kindness. At the right moment, it can be life-changing.  
   That is a perfect description of Senator BOB KERREY. It is the reason that he is the extraordinary man and the extraordinary leader and the extraordinary Senator that he has been in this body, and he is the reason that I support, with great enthusiasm, this resolution honoring him. 
   At this time, I yield for the junior Senator from Nebraska.

   I have listened this morning to the remarks from all of these distinguished Senators on this wonderful day honoring this extraordinary man. This is a man who loves others more than he loves himself, a man who loves his country more than he loves himself. 
   I have to say, Senator KERREY, I think your mother had it right when you were lying on that hospital bed in Philadelphia after your operation that removed part of your leg when she said, ``There's an awful lot left.'' There is an awful lot left, and we Americans are the beneficiaries of what is left.

   Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues, Senator WARNER and Senator LEVIN for their comments. I rise today in support of Senator HUTCHISON's amendment. I think it is critically important that we set minimal standards for TRICARE, which provides health insurance care for all of our military personnel, their dependents, and retirees. 
   There are currently 6.6 million people who are enrolled in TRICARE and 350,000 who are located in North Carolina. So I want to talk briefly about why this amendment is critical not only to the country, but also to the people of North Carolina. 
   Comdr. Ronald Smith, who is in the Greensboro-High Point area of North Carolina, has warned me about the experiences of his soldiers with TRICARE. In all of Guilford County, which is actually one of the largest counties in the State of North Carolina in terms of population, not a single primary care manager is willing to see his soldiers or their dependents. The nearest TRICARE hospital available is Womack Army Hospital, which is almost a 2-hour drive away. 
   Just last week, one of his active duty female soldiers drove to another county to see one of the only two primary care providers available in that area, only to find that they would not let her leave without paying a copayment, 
   even as an active duty member of the military. 
   Commander Smith tells me that local pharmacists are unwilling to fill military personnel prescriptions without up-front payment because they have had trouble getting reimbursed by TRICARE. Consequently, one second-class petty officer who recently came down with a bad case of the flu 4 days before payday was forced to take a no-interest loan in order to pay the prescriptions to treat her condition. Another active duty soldier held off on getting her blood pressure medication prescription refilled--she went without the medication for a week--because she couldn't afford the out-of-pocket expense for the medication. 
   All of this happens because local private physicians and pharmacist are unwilling to contract with TRICARE due to the lengthy waiting period for reimbursement and because reimbursement rates often fall below those allowed even by Medicare. 
   Recently in Onslow County, NC, the Onslow Hospital Authority voted unanimously to terminate the contract with TRICARE when it expires on May 1 and to renegotiate a new one. Onslow Memorial Hospital is currently owed more than $2 million in back claims from TRICARE. 
   Sgt. John Williams of Fayetteville, NC, recently wrote to me with his experience. His family is enrolled in TRICARE Prime. His daughter received a dermatologist consult in November from Womack Army Hospital. However, her appointments with the physician were canceled by the doctor's office three times, the last time with the explanation that the doctor had quit. In order to get an appointment with the new dermatologist, the girl had to go back through Womack. Sergeant Williams was told that if he chose to take her to a specialist at Duke of his own choice, TRICARE wouldn't pay and that a $300 charge would have to come out of his own packet. 
   Sabrina Williams had been waiting 81 days, at the time of Sergeant Williams' letter in January, to be seen by a dermatologist. In the meantime, the rash she was complaining of initially has spread over her entire body. She now has a second appointment with the dermatologist on March 1. Her first referral was on November 6 of last year. 
   As Senator HUTCHISON recognizes and as I recognize, we have to do better. Of course, I share everyone's concern  about the cost of implementing this program. Indeed, I am concerned about the cost of the whole bill. But after this TRICARE amendment, we have drafted a provision for assessing the cost of implementation within 6 months of enactment, and I am confident it will not cost much. We are aiming for increased efficiency with this, not increased costs. 
   I believe that the TRICARE system can be made to work if we work to make it better. This amendment takes the initial steps to addressing some of the main problems that are widely recognized by all of those participating in TRICARE. 
   Our service men and women deserve reliable, quality health care. We must show them that we value their commitment to our country by following through on our commitment to provide this fundamental benefit. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this measure. The TRICARE system has serious problems that need to be fixed. So I am proud to cosponsor Senator HUTCHISON's amendment. 
   Thank you. I yield the remainder of my time.

   Mr. EDWARDS. I thank the Chair. 
   It is a great honor for me to help cosponsor this particular piece of legislation. The truth is that the TRICARE system, which covers over 6 million Americans and over 300,000 North Carolinians is broken and it needs to be fixed. 
   Senator HUTCHISON's amendment goes a long way toward addressing the problems of the TRICARE system. It begins by setting minimum standards which the system clearly needs. 
   What I would like to do is talk just briefly today about why this is so important to Americans, and why it is so important to the people of North Carolina. And there are three or four examples that I think show that very clearly. 
   We have had lots of correspondence, lots of calls about problems with the TRICARE system. Comdr. Ronald Smith, who is from the Greensboro area in North Carolina, Guilford County, which is one of the most populous counties in North Carolina, tells us stories about the fact that in Greensboro there is no primary care provider who is willing to provide medical care for his soldiers and their dependents. 
   One example of the problem that creates is of a female soldier who had to travel to a different county to be treated, and when she went there, she had to actually write a check for a copayment before they would allow her to leave. 
   A second problem that Commander Smith tells us about is the problem pharmacies have getting reimbursed for their prescriptions. An example he gave was a soldier who had a case of the flu, a bad case of the flu, and needed prescription medication. But when the soldier went to get the prescription medication, she learned that she had to make a payment, cash payment, and didn't have the money. So this soldier had to actually go out and obtain a loan in order to get the prescription medication that she needed to treat the flu. 
   Another example of this problem is a soldier who was taking blood pressure medication that was critical to that soldier's health. The soldier put off for over a week taking the blood pressure medication because she didn't have the money to pay the cash that was needed to get the prescription medication. 
   This is a serious problem. These are problems that need to be addressed. A Sergeant Williams, who is from Fayetteville, NC, where the Womack Army Hospital is located, told me a story about his daughter which was really amazing. His daughter had a problem with a small rash. She went to the Womack Army Hospital and got a dermatology consult. That was easy to do because the hospital is located nearby. 
   Then he tried to schedule a number of office appointments for his daughter, but they kept being canceled. And then he decided, well, maybe I need to take her to see a private physician, perhaps at Duke in Durham, which is a little over an hour away. And he was told if he did that, he would have to make an out-of-pocket cash payment of $300 to have her seen. He was finally able to get something scheduled for her. At the time of his letter to me, it had been over 80 days since her initial consult and this rash, which began as a very small, inconsequential rash, had then spread over her entire body. 
   This is a serious problem. It is one that needs to be addressed, and it is one that Senator HUTCHISON's amendment addresses very directly. I do think that what we are here about is not increasing health care costs, but increasing efficiency. I think Senator HUTCHISON has some wonderful provisions in this amendment to address that problem. 
   We have an obligation to honor the commitment that the soldiers and their dependents have made to this country, and we need to provide quality health care to these folks. They deserve it. They have made an extraordinary commitment to this country. This country needs to show its commitment to the soldiers who have served and are serving and their dependents. I strongly urge my colleagues to vote for this amendment. This TRICARE system needs to be fixed, and this amendment goes a long way towards fixing it. I yield the floor.

   Mr. EDWARDS. I add my praise, Mr. Chief Justice, for the work you have done, but I would add one other thing. The last time I saw you before this impeachment trial you were leading a sing-along at the Fourth Circuit Judicial Conference. I thought it might be a good idea for this group.

   Mr. EDWARDS. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. I have prepared remarks. But I am not going to use them. I made that decision about 20 minutes ago. 
   I have been sitting, listening to my fellow Senators speak, and I want to  speak to you from the heart. I want to speak to you about a struggle, because I have been through a struggle. It is a real struggle. And I suspect that there are an awful lot of you who have been through the same struggle--both before we voted on the motion to dismiss and, for me, since we voted on the motion to dismiss. 
   For me, the law is a sacred thing. And that is part of my life. I have seen what the law can do. It is a powerful, powerful thing. It can do extraordinary things for ordinary people. And I believe we have been given a sacred responsibility. I will tell you what that sacred responsibility means to me personally. It means that when I walked in here the first day of this impeachment trial I was 100 percent completely open to voting to remove this President. 
   And I have to tell you all something, my friends on this side of the aisle, that wasn't a hard thing for me to do. I think this President has shown a remarkable disrespect for his office, for the moral dimensions of leadership, for his friends, for his wife, for his precious daughter. It is breathtaking to me the level to which that disrespect has risen. 
   So I said to myself, what is the right and fair thing to do? And this is what I have done. I have looked--many times until 3 a.m. in the morning--at the evidence in this case. Because I think that is the way we need to make this decision. 
   The perjury charge, I believe, is just not there. The evidence is not there to support it. I know many of you believe it is there. I respect your view on that. I don't believe it is there. The obstruction charge is a totally different matter. And this is the way I have thought about the obstruction charge. 
   I view, in my mind's eye, the scales of justice. And on one side, where the prosecution makes an allegation, I put their evidence. On the other side I put the defense evidence. And I do believe that for a charge this serious that the proper standard is beyond a reasonable doubt. 
   So after that evidence is put on both sides of the scale of justice, what happens? I want to just very briefly go through what I think are the four main charges for obstruction. 
   First, the false affidavit. The prosecution side: There is, in my judgment, clearly a false affidavit. The President had a conversation with Monica Lewinsky about filing an affidavit where he said to her, ``You can file an affidavit; that might be a way for you to avoid testifying.'' That is on the prosecution side. 
   I want to make a really important point for me personally here. I think there is an enormous difference between what has been proven and what we suspect, because I have to tell you all, I suspect a lot that has not been proven. 
   What is on the defense side? On the defense side: what has been proven in this case is that President Clinton never saw the affidavit, never had a discussion with anyone about the contents of that affidavit. He didn't know what was in it. He never told, according to her, Monica Lewinsky or anyone what should be in the affidavit. 
   So that is the evidence on the scales of justice: One for the prosecution; that evidence for the defense. For me it is a very clear thing. The scales tilt in favor of the defense, and they certainly don't tilt strongly enough to be beyond a reasonable doubt. 
   The second charge--and the one that bothers me the most--coaching Betty Currie. The evidence on the side of the prosecution: President Clinton has a conversation with Betty Currie just after he has been questioned in his deposition where he makes very declarative statements to her--it happens twice--very declarative statements to her about what he remembers, many of which we now know to be false. And his explanation for that conversation lacks credibility, to say the least, that he was trying to refresh his memory. I doubt if anybody buys that. That is on one side, that is on the prosecution side. 
   What is on the other side? On the other side we have Betty Currie saying it had no influence on her. But that is not the most troublesome thing for me. The troublesome thing is this: For that conversation to be obstruction of justice, it must have been proven that it was President Clinton's intent to affect her sworn testimony. 
   Now, what are the other possibilities? We have a man who has just been confronted with this problem, who is political by nature. And do we really believe that the first thing he thought about is, ``I'm going to go protect myself legally''? I suspect the first thing he thought about is ``I'm going to protect myself politically.'' He was worried about his family finding out. He was worried about the rest of the staff finding out. He was worried about the press finding out. Do I know which of these things are true? Absolutely not. I don't know which of them are true. Doesn't that answer the question? If we don't know which of those things are true, have they been proven? If we don't know what was in his head at that moment, how can we find that the prosecution has proven intent beyond a reasonable doubt? 
   The third charge, the job search. On the prosecution side of the scales of justice, we have an intensified effort to find a job for Monica Lewinsky. I think that has been proven. I think that has been proven clearly. On the other side, we have testimony from Monica Lewinsky that she was never promised a job for her silence. We have evidence that the job search, although not as intense, was going on before anyone knew she would be a witness. We have Vernon Jordan testifying under oath--I sat there and watched it and looked him in the eye--that there was never a quid pro quo, that the affidavit was over here and the job search was over here. 
   The reality is, when you put all that evidence on the scale--prosecution evidence on one side, defense evidence on the other--at worst the scale stays even. And the prosecution has got to prove this case in order to remove the President of the United States beyond a reasonable doubt. They just have not proven it no matter what we suspect. No matter what we suspect. So that is the false affidavit which we have talked about, coaching Betty Currie, the job search. 
   Now to the gifts. Let's see what the proof is. What is the proof--not the suspicion. On the prosecution side, we know that the President's secretary went to Monica Lewinsky's house, got the gifts, took them home and hid them under her bed. I have to tell you, on its face, that is awful suspicious, and it is strong, heavy evidence. The problem is, there is evidence on the other side. That evidence doesn't stand alone. 
   First, we have the testimony of Betty Currie that Monica Lewinsky called her. Second, we have the fact that President Clinton gave her other gifts on that Sunday, which makes no sense to me. I heard the House managers try to explain it away. I have been a lawyer for 20 years, and I have been in that place of trying to explain away something that makes no sense. It doesn't make sense. Monica Lewinsky, herself, testified that she brought up the issue of gifts--not President Clinton--and that the most President Clinton ever said was something to the effect of ``I'm not sure. Let me think about that.'' 
   Now when that evidence goes on the defense side and the only evidence on the prosecution side is the fact that those gifts are sitting under the bed of Betty Currie, what happens to the scale? At best, the scale stays even. In my judgment, it actually tilts for the defense. There is no way it rises to the level of ``beyond a reasonable doubt.'' 
   Every trial I have ever been in has had one moment, one quintessential moment when the entirety of the trial was described, and in this case we have such a moment. There was a question that had my name on it. The reality is, Senator KOHL wrote it--I tagged on--but it was a great question. The question was, Is this a matter about which reasonable people can differ? I will never forget Manager Lindsey GRAHAM coming to this microphone and his answer was ``Absolutely.'' Now if the prosecution concedes that reasonable people can differ about this, how can we not have reasonable doubt? 
   These things all lead me to the conclusion that however reprehensible the President's conduct is, I have to vote to acquit on both articles of impeachment. 
   I have one last thing I want to say to you all, and it is actually most important. If you don't remember anything else I said, and you weren't listening to  anything else I have said, please listen to what I am about to say because it is so important to me. 
   I have learned so much during the 30 days that I have been here. I have had a mentor in Senator BYRD, who has probably been a mentor to many others before me. I have formed friendships with people on both sides. Senators LEAHY and DODD, who I worked with on these depositions--wonderful, wonderful Senators. I have learned what leadership is about from these two men sitting right here--Senators LOTT and DASCHLE. I have loved working with Senators DEWINE and THOMPSON. And Senator SPECTER and I worked together on a deposition. He showed me great deference and respect. I have no idea why, but he did; and I appreciate it. I have deep respect and admiration for my senior Senator from North Carolina, who has been extraordinarily kind and gracious to me since I arrived here. 
   Let me tell you what I will be thinking about when my name is called and I cast my vote, hopefully tomorrow. I will be thinking about juries all over this country who are sitting in deliberation in rooms that are not nearly as grand as this but who are struggling, just as you all have and I have, to do the right thing. I have to say, I have a boundless faith in the American people sitting on those juries. They want to do what is right. They want to do what is right in the worst kind of way. 
   An extraordinary thing has happened to me in the last 30 days. I have watched you struggle, every one of you. I have watched you come to this podium. I have listened to what you have had to say. I talked to you informally; I watched you suffer. I believe in my heart that every single one of you wants to do the right thing. The result of that for me is a gift. And that gift is that I now have a boundless faith in you. 
   Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

   Mr. EDWARDS. Yes, Mr. Chief Justice, with regard to their exhibits. 
   Mr. Manager HUTCHINSON. Mr. Chief Justice, I would be happy to take advantage of the 5 minutes, but I have talked to the other managers and we are not aware of any corrections that need to be made on any of our exhibits we have offered to the Senate. 
   Mr. KERRY addressed the Chair.
