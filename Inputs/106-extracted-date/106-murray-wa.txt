   Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I want the RECORD to reflect my strong support for the final appropriations measure that we are completing today. 
   Since the first day I walked into this distinguished Chamber, I have been fighting to bring the priorities of our budget closer to the priorities of America's families. As I talk to parents and students in my State about what would improve their lives, over and over, I hear that a quality education for our students is a top priority for families across this country. 
   Today is a victory for families. The Labor-HHS-Education appropriations bill shows this Congress is listening to people across this country. It provides a $6.5 billion increase in education spending. This is a 17 percent increase. It makes an investment in the things that matter--reducing class size, improving teacher quality, and repairing and constructing schools. This bill gives the Congress a benchmark to work with the new President who has made education a personal priority. 
   I have come to the Senate floor numerous times over the years to ask for an investment in reducing class size. This is something that matters to parents, teachers and students across this country. After a year long battle against efforts to eliminate class size reduction funds, this bill provides $1.62 billion final appropriations bill for the purpose of reducing class size. 
   By making this investment, we are sending an important message to every community in this Nation. Class size reduction is important because it makes a tangible difference in real-world public schools. 
   I've talked to teachers in my State about class size reduction. These teachers told me the benefits of smaller  class size. They say that when class sizes are smaller, they see better student achievement, fewer discipline problems, more individual attention, better parent-teacher communication, and dramatic results for poor and minority students. 
   These are the kinds of things we need in our public schools. Our kids deserve this investment. 
   In Washington State, the funds included in this bill will provide over $25 million to the State for the purpose of reducing class size. Currently, over 600 teachers have been hired with Federal class size reduction funds across the State to reduce class size. With the funds secured this year, Washington State will be able to hire approximately additional 130 new teachers to reduce class size. 
   This appropriations agreement also makes an important investment in school construction. Students across this country are going to school in inadequate facilities. The majority of students in this country attend schools that are over 40 years old. These have leaky roofs, inadequate heating and cooling, and are not the type of learning environment that goes hand in hand with expecting our students to achieve high standards. This bill makes an investment in school construction, providing $1.2 billion for this purpose. 
   In addition, it makes an investment in teacher quality. Our districts need help in the area of teacher quality. The districts need to be able to provide teachers the support they need, and make efforts to reach out and bring more highly qualified people into the teaching profession. This appropriations bill provides a $150 million increase over last year in our investment to improve teacher quality. 
   This bill provides more than a 30-percent increase for IDEA, the biggest increase in the program history. I'm sure there is not a member of this Senate who has not visited a school district and heard the struggles the district faces in funding special education services. This bill provides $1.35 billion more for IDEA than last year. We should not back down from this commitment to our schools. 
   The bill provides close to a 50-percent increase for after school programs. The funding is raised from $435 million to $851 million. 
   There is a much needed investment in child care. There is a 70-percent increase in child care funding, bringing the funding up to $2 billion. With these additional funds, nearly 150,000 children will receive child care subsidies. 
   An increase of over $1 billion in Head Start: These funds would allow an additional 70,000 children to participate in Head Start. 
   The bill invests in college opportunities for students. The $450 increase in the Pell Grant Program and the substantial increase for SEOG, LEAP, and Federal work-study will give more families the ability to send their children to college. 
   While I am extremely disappointed that this Congress failed to finish consideration of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, I am glad we were able to make a commitment to kids through this appropriations bill. Investing in reducing class size, teacher quality, college affordability, and things to help our young children like Head Start and child care are the kind of investments we need in this country. 
   While these investments are not quite as high as the ones agreed to in October, I still believe we are moving the right direction in this bill by investing in the things that we know work. Kids, teachers and parents across this country deserve these investments. 
   And while I have focused my remarks on education, I should note that this bill contains vital investments in many key areas like health care. I am immensely proud of the increased 
   investments we are making in health care research at the National Institutes of Health and the Centers for Disease Control. These investments represent our strong commitment to finding cures to life threatening ailments like breast and prostrate cancer, Parkinson's disease, and multiple sclerosis. This bill funds key health projects in Washington State like Children's Hospital and others. 
   This bill makes an essential investment in health care with $35 billion for BBRA relief. These improvements are imperative for access to quality health care for people everywhere. I cannot emphasize enough the importance of these changes to hospitals, home health, skilled nursing facilities which serve the elderly. Ensuring this population has high quality health care is high priority, and I commend my colleagues for recognizing this pressing need. 
   As a member of the Labor-HHS-Education Subcommittee, I urge my colleagues to join in support for this bill.

   Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, as we all know congressional lame duck sessions following an election are a rarity. They usually arise when Congress is unable to finish its business in a timely fashion, and that is true with this year as well. 
   But this session affords me and this Congress an opportunity to acknowledge and pay tribute to the service of an esteemed colleague. Senator SLADE GORTON, the Senior Senator from Washington state, will be ending his service here after 18 years in the Senate. 
   Washingtonians--regardless of party affiliation--have come up to me with high praise and appreciation for Senator GORTON'S long service to our state, our country and this proud institution. 
   I want to share with my colleagues a passage from an editorial this week in the Everett Herald. The Herald editorial reads,  
   History will rank Gorton with Senator Henry M. ``Scoop'' Jackson and Senator Warren G. Magnuson as an extraordinary leader in D.C. on behalf of the state. 
   Throughout his career in the Senate and state government, Gorton has been a leading force in many major efforts to protect the environment. 
   He also has been a consistent, passionate advocate for individuals with problems dealing with bureaucracy. 
   Within the Senate, Gorton has been a grand force for reasoned bipartisanship, never afraid to take a strong stand but also willing to work graciously and effectively with members of the opposition even at the tensest moments.  
   Many of our colleagues are well aware of SLADE'S history of public service. As a young man, SLADE GORTON moved to Washington state from Chicago almost 50 years ago. 
   He wanted to go West in search of new opportunities. And with $300 and a one-way ticket on a Greyhound bus, SLADE GORTON moved to Washington State. 
   History has shown that this Midwest native fit right into Washington State. And like so many immigrants to our great State, SLADE GORTON was welcomed and given an opportunity to make the most of his talents. 
   From the very beginning, SLADE GORTON went to work on behalf of Washington State. First, he married Sally Clark from Selah, Washington. That same year--1958--SLADE went into politics and was elected to the Washington State House of Representatives where he rose to serve as the majority leader. 
   In 1968, he was elected attorney general of Washington State. On numerous occasions on several historic cases, SLADE represented the people of Washington before the Supreme Court. 
   Chief Justice Warren Burger once said that SLADE, ``makes the best arguments before the Supreme Court of any Attorney General in America.'' He was also recognized with the prestigious Wyman Award given to the outstanding attorney general in the United States. 
   By this time, SLADE had also become a respected leader throughout Washington State. 
   After three terms as the Washington State Attorney General, SLADE GORTON ran for an won a seat in the United States Senate. He was elected three times to the United States Senate giving him an impressive record of winning statewide election six times in Washington. 
   All of this is offered as a brief history of SLADE's many years of service. With time, there will certainly be many public tributes to Senator GORTON. But  what I'd like to focus on now is our time together in the United States Senate and the work we were able to do together over the last eight years. 
   I am sure all of my colleagues share my own appreciation for the support, guidance, and sacrifices our families make so that we can serve in the Senate. Our successes throughout our careers in public service are shared with our families. We rely on them in so many ways. 
   And that is certainly true for SLADE GORTON. Sally and SLADE have been partners for all of his years of service. From Olympia, Washington to Washington, D.C., Sally Gorton has been there each and every day. She and SLADE have three children and seven grandchildren, who I know bring immense pride to the Gorton family. 
   So, as we acknowledge and honor SLADE GORTON, I want to pay special tribute to Sally Gorton and the entire Gorton Family. We've all had to endure some tough things in seeking to represent our States in the Senate. We accept that politics can sometimes be rough. 
   Our families--as our biggest defenders--often take it more personally than we do. And, like all political families, the Gorton family has been instrumental to all of SLADE'S many successes. Washington State is proud and appreciative of all that Sally Gorton has also done. 
   Much has been said in Washington State about the differences between Senator GORTON and myself. And while SLADE and I have had our differences, not enough has been said about our ability to work together on behalf of Washington State.

   Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the RECORD a number of statements regarding Senator GORTON and his distinguished service. I want to take particular note of the statement by our colleague, JOE LIEBERMAN, who could not be here today. Senator GORTON and Senator LIEBERMAN worked on many initiatives over the years. I want to read his statement:  
   Mr. President, I wish to express my greatest respect and affection for Slade Gorton of Washington with whom I have enjoyed working closely for a number of years. Slade's life is characterized by his commitment to faith, family, service, and law. As he leaves the Senate, I want to reminisce about some of the matters I have been privileged to work with Slade Gorton. 
   Over the years, Senator SLADE GORTON has been a great leader on educational reform, striving to raise the performance of our nation's elementary and secondary schools and the quality of education so that all children may reach a high level of academic achievement. The senior Senator for Washington and I have worked together on a number of proposals to improve our educational system. His contributions have led the way for better educational accountability and innovation in the years ahead. 
   Of great importance to our country are Slade Gorton's continued efforts to preserve and honor American history by calling for stronger history curriculum standards and literacy awareness in our colleges and universities. I truly believe such endeavors help to unite our nation by demonstrating the importance of our shared heritage and civic culture as Americans. 
   One of my most memorable experiences with Slade was the work we did together after the House impeached President Clinton. All of us in the Senate knew that how we handled the impeachment trial would test us all--both individually and as an institution. We could either fall into intense partisanship, miring ourselves and the country in lengthy and disruptive proceedings that threatened to leave this institution demeaned and scarred, or we could rise above partisanship and join together in a way that preserved this body's dignity while at the same time ensuring a full airing of the issues before us. 
   Slade took the lead in guiding us to a dignified path, formulating a plan that ultimately formed the basis of the process the Senate adopted. Notwithstanding his personal views, his love for his country and this institution led him to put principle above partisanship and to formulate a plan for resolving the impeachment case before it wreaked more havoc on the Senate and the nation. I was delighted to work on that plan with him, and was impressed again by the civilized, thoughtful, and nonpartisan way in  which Slade Gorton proceeded. I truly believe that his leadership was instrumental in seeing the Senate through that difficult time with honor. 
   Slade Gorton leaves the Senate with much to be proud of, and much to look forward to. For my wife and myself, I send Slade and Sally and their wonderful family love and every good wish for the next great chapter of their lives.

   Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to express my disappointment with the Bankruptcy Conference Report. I reluctantly will be voting no on the final conference agreement because it fails the fairness test and because it fails to protect the most vulnerable families facing dire financial times. 
   I have supported bankruptcy reform in the past. I continue to support fair and balanced reforms to prohibit the misuse of the bankruptcy code and to prohibit individuals from using the code as a shield against honoring their financial commitments. We need reform because we all pay for the abuses. Working families struggling with the cost of credit deserve reform. Families trying to save to purchase their first home cannot afford the added burden forced on them due to abuse of our bankruptcy laws. 
   Unfortunately, the final product presented to the Senate is unacceptable. In an attempt to prevent a fair and open debate, this conference report has bypassed the normal legislative process, and Senators have been denied the opportunity to improve the legislation. Clearly this conference report has been driven by special interests and not the interests of working families. It does not ensure that mothers and children who depend on child support and alimony payments won't lose out to big special interests. It does not require any responsible actions by credit card companies in educating or informing consumers to the cost of debt. 
   This conference report is vastly different from the bill that passed the Senate in March. I supported that bill. The conference report before us, however, will make it impossible for families to seek bankruptcy protection when they are hit with overwhelming financial problems often caused by events beyond their control. In many cases, families are forced into bankruptcy due to unexpected medical bills caused by a disabling accident or condition. Many women are forced into bankruptcy due to the break up of their family and their inability to collect court ordered child support. These families should not be turned away simply because credit card companies made reckless decisions in issuing credit to individuals unable to manage debt or unaware of the costs of managing debt. 
   This conference report also eliminates the Schumer Clinic Violence Amendment that I cosponsored and that I believe must be part of any reform bill. We cannot allow those who use violence or the threat of violence to shield themselves from financial responsibilities by running to bankruptcy court. Without the Schumer amendment, the Bankruptcy Code will continue to be subject to exploitation by perpetrators of violence against women. Protecting access to reproductive health clinics and providers is not an abortion issue, but a women's health and safety issue. 
   Violent anti-choice groups provide legal assistance to violent protesters on how to use the Code to protect their assets against possible financial liability. Their criminal debts are simply excused under the current Code. This conference report fails to close that loophole. The Schumer amendment was adopted on an 80 to 17 vote, but the final conference agreement simply dropped this bipartisan anti-violence amendment. 
   We know that this conference report will be vetoed and has little or no chance of becoming law. The decision to push this through in a partisan manner has jeopardized bankruptcy reform. As a result, working families will suffer. I am hopeful that with the new Congress and the need to work in a bipartisan manner we will see real bankruptcy reform in the next Congress. I will continue to work for reform that is balanced, fair and that protects women against violence and intimidation. I want reform, but not at the expense of women or children. 
   Mr. President, I hope all of my colleagues will honor the mandate we all received in the election. The American people did not give one party or one philosophy a mandate to govern. They want a bipartisan Congress that will put aside political bickering and special interest and work to solve the problems facing real people and real families.

   Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, one of the most important issues we consider here in the U.S. Senate is how to balance our economic needs with our responsibility to conserve our natural resources. 
   I believe we can strike the right balance. With that hope, I'd like to talk about America's fisheries. In the Pacific Northwest, fishing is more than just a way of life. It is an important part of our economy and contributes to our region's culture. 
   Unfortunately, that way of life is becoming more difficult. Many fishing families are struggling because some fish stocks are at very low levels. For example, the West Coast salmon and groundfish and the Bering Sea/Aleutian Islands crab fisheries have declined dramatically in recent years. Washington's fishing families contribute to our economy and feed consumers both here and abroad, but too often they work within a system that threatens their safety and their livelihood. I've met with harvesters and processors from my region, and I've visited small towns in Washington state that depend on fisheries. The problems they face aren't limited to Washington state. They can also be seen in Alaska and other states. 
   In an effort to recover decreasing numbers of fish in our waters, fisheries managers have developed complex management systems to limit fishing. In some cases, our current policies encourage fishers to catch as many fish as possible over a limited period of time. This creates a dangerous and inefficient ``race for fish'', which requires fishermen to venture out in bad weather. In fact, one of the most dangerous occupations for young people today is to work in the Bering Sea/Aleutian Island crab fishery. The ``race for fish'' is one way to manage fisheries in which too many fishermen are competing for too few fish. However, there are alternatives to this management approach. 
   I'm proud that there is a growing interest in an innovative management tool called individual fishing quotas. This creative approach uses the marketplace to encourage a safer, more productive, and more sustainable fishing industry. In some cases, it would be a significant improvement over the status quo. 
   Individual fishing quotas or IFQs would bring some regularity to what are currently short-lived, intense fishing seasons. Under this system, each participant in a fishery would be allocated a percentage of that season's total fish catch. Because they are guaranteed a certain amount of fish, fishermen wouldn't have to ``race for fish.'' They could stretch their fishing out over longer, more balanced fishing seasons. 
   I believe that individual fishing quotas can help fisherman, fisheries, conservation, and consumers. IFQs can help fishing families because boats won't need to go out in dangerous weather. In addition, because of the slower pace, fishermen would be less likely to lose fishing gear, a common problem in some fisheries. This new system can help fisheries because fishermen will be able to sell or lease quota. That means there will be fewer boats, which can mean cleaner, more efficient fisheries. 
   In addition, IFQs can improve conservation. In some cases when the fishery slows down, fishermen take better care of their catch and are more careful with bycatch. Let's look at just one example of how the speed of the current system hurts conservation. Currently, some North Pacific crabs that are too small to be caught legally end up trapped in crab pots. Under the race for fish, these pots are harvested so quickly that undersized crabs don't have time to escape. Under a slower fishery, those small crabs would have time to crawl out of the crab pots and grow to maturity, thereby helping to sustain the fishery into the future. 
   For consumers, IFQs mean they can enjoy fresh fish later in the seasons. For example, fresh halibut is now available more often as a result of a fish quota program put in place to manage halibut harvesting. Clearly, individual fishing quotas can be an effective management tool and can solve a lot of the problems facing fisheries today. 
   I'm pleased that many of my colleagues have expressed interest in IFQs. In fact, a number of members would like to see a national policy on IFQs developed. Since 1996, I've supported fish quotas and a national policy, and I reiterate my support again today. 
   But in the meantime, there are important steps we can take. When Congress reauthorized the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act in 1996, Congress placed a  four-year moratorium on new individual fishing quota programs. The moratorium on new quota programs expired on September 30, 2000. Now that this ban has expired, we should allow fishery management councils to develop additional fish quota programs. Councils should have the freedom to develop and implement these programs. I am not advocating that Councils be required to implement them, because individual fishing quota programs must be developed on a fishery-by-fishery basis. I do think, however, that individual quota programs should be available as one of the many management tools Councils may draw upon. I must add that all eight Councils have asked for this freedom and have asked for Congress to lift the moratorium. 
   However, I know that some members want to extend the moratorium. They don't want to 
   allow some fisheries to go ahead with IFQs until there is a national policy in place. I understand and appreciate this perspective. I also recognize members of the environmental community would be more comfortable with such programs if a national policy were already in place. As I said, I support a national policy on these programs, and I look forward to working with my colleagues next year to develop one. 
   However, I would like to point out that all fishery management plans, including those that rely on quota programs, are required to meet the national standards already in the Act. Let me offer a few examples of these standards. Any fish quota program would have to meet National Standard 4, which prohibits conservation and management measures from discriminating between residents of different states. This standard also mandates that fishing privileges be allocated fairly and equitably, that they are calculated to promote conservation, and that they are carried out so that no entity shall have an excessive share. Any fish quota program would also have to meet National Standard 8, which requires such measures to take into account the importance of fishery resources to fishing communities. They would also have to meet National Standard 9, which requires measures to minimize bycatch, and National Standard 10, which addresses safety. 
   In addition, the Act requires all individual fishing quota programs approved on or after October 1, 2000, to meet several additional criteria. For example, these programs must be subject to review based on any future national policy and such revision may require reallocation of quota. These programs must also be effectively managed and enforced, which may require reliance on observers and/or cost-recovery fees. In addition, these criteria address the most contentious aspect of individual quota programs: the initial allocation of quota. The Act requires programs to ensure a fair initial allocation of quota, to prevent excessive control over quota, and to include a mechanism for entry-level fishermen, small vessel owners and crew members to access quota. I think all of these examples illustrate that some elements integral to a national policy on individual fishing quota programs are already included in the Act. I believe we are much closer to having a national policy in place than some people may believe. 
   Unfortunately, it appears likely that the moratorium will be extended. Therefore, I ask my colleagues to consider several caveats to this extension. First, I ask that the moratorium be extended for only 8 months. This will take the moratorium off the appropriations cycle. Placing the moratorium on the yearly appropriations cycle creates a precedent that is easy to repeat every year. Taking the moratorium off the appropriations cycle will increase the urgency for Congress to develop a national policy within the months ahead. 
   Second, I ask for an exception to the moratorium for fixed-gear sablefish along the West Coast. This fishery is ready for fishermen to be allowed to consolidate permits, which is technically considered an IFQ. In fact, the fishery has been ready to do so since 1994. We should not make these fishermen wait any longer. They deserve to be freed from a 9-day race for fish, and fishermen who want to get out of the fishery should be compensated for their investments. I ask for your support for this exception. 
   Third, I support asking NMFS to gather input from the eight regional Councils on a national policy for individual fishing quotas. It is appropriate and important for Congress to have this input before we finalize a national policy on quota programs. 
   Most important, however, I ask for the commitment of my colleagues to deal with this issue next year, during the first session of the 107th Congress. It is not fair to punish those few fisheries that are ready to move forward with quota programs just because other fisheries are not. We have already had four years to resolve these issues, to no avail. If my colleagues believe this issue must be addressed within the broader context of Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act reauthorization, I understand and I hope they will consider this Senator ready and willing to move forward with that challenge. I support Senator SNOWE's and Senator KERRY's efforts to hold more hearings on reauthorization, and I offer to help them in any way I can to ensure it happens. 
   Let's commit ourselves to have a productive, comprehensive dialogue on a national policy. Let's commit to reaching a consensus that will allow our Councils and fisheries to pursue this innovative, effective solution that can work for fishing families, fisheries, conservation and consumers.

   Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with my colleagues on the HELP Committee in urging passage of this important bipartisan legislation to reauthorize the Older Americans Act. 
   For more than 30 years, the Older Americans Act has been our Nation's most important resource for helping seniors get the services they need in their own communities. 
   The OAA provides funding for senior centers, transportation, recreation, adult education, Meals-on-Wheels, preventive health care, and other essential services. 
   In fiscal year 2000 alone, OAA programs have provided more than $15 million in services in Washington State. 
   In addition, the act provides resources for the Nation's largest program for older workers, and it provides subsidized jobs and training to more than 65,000 low-income workers over age 54. 
   With more people retiring, the demand for OAA services has grown dramatically in recent years. Unfortunately, the program has not kept pace with current needs. 
   Today, we have an opportunity to finally reauthorize the Older Americans Act, and I'm calling on my colleagues to pass a clean reauthorization bill that is based on the bipartisan legislation developed by the members of the HELP Committee. 
   As a member of the Aging Subcommittee of the HELP Committee, I have been eager to pass a strong reauthorization bill, 
   While I'm disappointed it has taken so long, I know this bill will improve the programs that seniors and their families rely on. 
   As I have traveled around my State, I've seen the impact these programs are making. It's not just seniors who want the act reauthorized. Their families, physicians and communities also want to see the Act strengthened. 
   The safety net programs authorized in the Older Americans Act provide a life line for our most vulnerable citizens. 
   The Older Americans Act closes the gaps in services and offers seniors a way to maintain a dignified quality of life. 
   The nutritional assistance programs alone are critical to addressing the needs of low and moderate income seniors. 
   Job training programs allow seniors to keep their economic independence and to maintain important social ties to their communities. 
   The most significant improvement in this legislation is the creation of the new Family Caregiver Support program. 
   This innovative new program will offer families real support in meeting the long term care needs of their loved ones. 
   It will also provide assistance to older spouses--often older women--who are left to care for a frail family member. 
   The Aging Subcommittee heard testimony from many family members who are struggling to care for their aging parents. Because they don't have any help, they face significant financial and emotional burdens. 
   I know this new program will begin to address the problems facing those families who are caring for aging relatives in their homes. 
   I thank the chairman of the Aging Subcommittee, Senator DEWINE, for his leadership in making this bill a reality. 
   I also thank Senator MIKULSKI for her efforts and hard work in making sure we honor the commitment to our seniors before we adjourn for the year. 
   I urge my colleagues to defeat the pending amendment and send this bill to the President without further delay. 
   We cannot allow this session to end without continuing the programs that have served America's seniors so well throughout the years. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise as a member of the Foreign Operations Appropriations Subcommittee to express my strong support for this conference report. I want to extend my congratulations to Senator LEAHY and Senator MCCONNELL as this is clearly one of the best Foreign Operations bills produced in recent years. 
   This is a good bill which will advance U.S. interests on many fronts. This is a good bill for my constituents who are engaged in global affairs in everything from international trade to humanitarian relief efforts. This is always a tough bill to finish because it address several very controversial issues. Unlike years past, however, this bill is being widely praised by both parties and by the Administration. Again, that is a tribute to the leaders of our subcommittee who worked so hard to bridge very difficult issues. 
   Perhaps the most significant agreement within this bill is the commitment to fulfill U.S. obligations on debt relief. By providing the requested $435 million for debt relief, this Congress is sending a powerful message to the poorest countries in the world. The U.S. and the international community, by following through on debt relief to the world's poorest citizens, can give new hope to millions of people. I am proud to have supported this effort. And I am so proud of my constituents who embraced campaigns like Jubilee 2000 which made debt relief an issue no one could ignore. 
   I want to single out one gentleman in particular who touched so many of us here on Capitol Hill with his work. The Reverend David Duncombe from White Salmon, Washington was a heroic champion for debt relief. On two occasions in the last year, Reverend Duncombe staged hunger strikes here in Washington, D.C. to demonstrate the effects of starvation on the human body. Reverend Duncombe visited my office almost every Wednesday morning when he was in Washington, D.C. He stood before us all, day after day, in solidarity with the millions of people affected by this issue. Passage of debt relief is a genuine tribute to people like David Duncombe who rallied Americans to the debt relief cause all across our country. I'm proud Americans came together to ensure our foreign aid dollars will make a difference for poor citizens around the world. 
   I am strongly in support of this bill's increased funding for international family planning. This bill also repeals the global ``Gag'' order which has crippled our international family planning efforts in previous bills. We know that more and more women in the developing world are starting businesses and contributing to the economic health of families. These women want access to family planning programs and information to build strong, sustainable families. It is time to take our domestic political debate out of the international family planning appropriations process once and for all. International family planning programs help save the lives of women throughout the world. International family planning in a health issue and should be treated that way. 
   This bill is also strong in the area of export promotion. This bill provides more than $900 million to the Export-Import Bank of the United States which facilitates job creating exports from throughout our country. Other trade promotion entities like OPIC and TDA will receive increased funding under this bill as well. These programs are tangible, real proof that our foreign aid program generates jobs and economic opportunity for Americans. 
   There's so much more in this bill which will benefit America's interests. We continue our strong program of microcredit lending. Our commitment to UNICEF and important organizations like the Peace Corps continues with this bill. And we are providing increased funding to confront AIDS, tuberculosis and other health threats to the developing world. I am particularly supportive of the bill's $50 million contribution to the Global Alliance for Vaccines & Immunizations. The Foreign Operations Subcommittee has devoted much energy to the GAVI effort, and I encourage the Senate to continue its involvement in this promising program. 
   Our efforts to assist Russia and the former Soviet states as they continue to struggle with reform are key parts of this bill. Washington state is particularly interested in the Russian Far East. This bill funds democracy-building initiatives, economic transition and other programs for most regions of the former Soviet Union. It's frustrating work, but I support this assistance because it is important to our national interest. In other parts of the world, this bill funds human rights work, environmental protection programs, and other important democracy-building initiatives. From Burma to Serbia to Latin America, this bill works to advance America's interests in so many areas. 
   Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support this important conference report.

   Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I join my colleague from Missouri in telling the family of Mel Carnahan how deeply sorry we all are. 
   It must be a terribly difficult time for the citizens of his State, for his family, and for everyone who knew him. I hope we can carry on his tradition, one about which he talked so much in the last four decades, of making sure all of our children get a good education and the people of this great country have the opportunities about which he cared so deeply. 
   I thank the Senator from Missouri.

   Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I have come to the floor today to talk about education. 
   In the past month, students across our country have gone back to school. They have entered schools where there are health and safety hazards, and they are trying to learn in classrooms that are overcrowded. They are competing for the time and attention of a teacher, and they are looking to us for support. 
   I am frustrated to say this, but as this session of Congress draws to a close, this Congress has done very little to support those children across this country. This Congress, for the first time in 30 years, has failed to reauthorize the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. That is a disservice to students who are trying to learn in overcrowded classrooms, to students who are stuck in crumbling schools, and to students who do not feel safe at school. 
   We can't pass ESEA reauthorization; it is too late. But we do have one place to make it up: in the final funding plan for the upcoming fiscal year. 
   There are kids out there counting on us to do the right thing, and we need to pass a budget that addresses their needs. That is why I have come to the floor today, to urge my colleagues to do just that. 
   As I look back on this session of Congress, I am frustrated by the way this process has broken down. We have been updating our national education policy for about 30 years. It has always been a bipartisan and productive process--but not this year. This year, the ESEA reauthorization was stalled by sharp partisanship. We had a chance to make a lot of progress, but this Congress failed. 
   We weren't able to update our Nation's education policy to meet the needs of today's classrooms. As a parent, as a former educator and a former school board member, that is discouraging. What is even more discouraging is some of the talk that we have heard on the campaign trail this year. Not long ago, Governor Bush said that our country is experiencing a ``recession in education.'' I have thought a lot about that statement. To the teachers who are working harder than ever, it certainly doesn't feel like a recession. In fact, I think Governor Bush has it exactly backward. A recession is where there is a slowdown in economic activity, when production and employment decline, when there isn't much demand, when workers are idle and factories are slow. That is a recession. 
   But that is not what is happening in education today at all. Our schools are not slowing down; they are working harder than ever. Our classrooms aren't empty; they are overcrowded. Our teachers aren't being idle because they are not needed; they are needed more now than ever. It is not that demand has slowed. The demands on our schools are higher than ever. The problem is our investment has not kept up. Any enterprise or business that wants to stay in business invests in its people, invests in the latest equipment, invests in capital projects, so that the capacity will keep up with the demand. That is what we have to do. But for some reason, when it comes to our schools, we have not made those investments. We have let schools that were built 40 or 50 years ago simply decline. We have let great educators leave the classroom because they are frustrated by a system that doesn't give them the support or respect they deserve. 
   Governor Bush, we are not in an education recession; we are in a period of explosive growth and growing demand in the classroom, and we need to make the investment to meet that growing demand. Governor Bush has the problem backward and that is why he has come up with the wrong solution. As a parent of two students who went to public school, I can tell you I don't want our next President to close down my school; I want him to make my school better. You don't do that by bashing public schools. You do it by investing in the things that we know work in the classroom. 
   I have said it before and I will say it again: Our schools are facing overwhelming challenges with inadequate resources. Our public schools are not failing, but by failing to invest in them this Congress is failing our public schools. We need to give our schools the resources, the tools, and the support to meet today's challenges. 
   There are important needs in my home State in classrooms. Sitting here in the Chamber, it is easy to forget the challenges that schools face across the country. If this Chamber is about to go into recess without making an investment in education, it needs to hear directly from people on the front line. So I decided to read a few letters I have received from students and teachers in my home State of Washington. 
   Kristen Jensen Story is a parent and a teacher at White Center Heights Elementary School in the Highline School District. At her school, the majority of the students live in public housing and come from homes where English is not the first language. 
   She tells me:  
   We have been working hard to make sure these children succeed and become contributing citizens to our great Nation. The need for Federal public education funding is greater now than ever before. 
   We have the money. The Federal budget is forecasted to have a $1.9 trillion surplus over the next decade. Make the funding of public education a national priority.  
   Let me read another letter. This one is from Becky Scheiderer, a teacher from the Bethel School District in Washington State. 
   She writes:  
   Children cannot wait another session.  
   She goes on to explain some of the challenges her school is facing:  
   Our students need to continue the successful programs, such as Title I, special education, and smaller class sizes to work with these students inclusively.  
   Our district is growing, and we need schools constructed soon. 
   Our teachers, students and staff need safe schools to work in for 7.5 hours a day. 
   The need for Federal funding is even greater now than ever before.  
   Those are some of the real challenges facing our schools, and you don't fix them by bashing educators; you fix them by making an investment in the things that we know work. 
   I want to turn to a few investments that we should be making in our final budget plan. It is our last chance this year to do the right thing for America's students. Let me start with making classrooms less crowded. We know our classrooms are overcrowded and we know that students can learn the basics, with fewer discipline problems, in less crowded classrooms. 
   Parents know it, students know it, teachers know it, and studies show it. 
   Two years ago, we made an investment in making classrooms less crowded. I am pleased to report that the investment is paying off for America's students. It is making a positive difference in their education. We gave local school districts the money to go out and hire more than 29,000 new qualified teachers for the early grades. And today, 1.7 million students are learning in less crowded classrooms. 
   Our goal is to hire 100,000 new teachers. You would think that with the success we have had so far, there would be no question that we would keep our commitment to reducing class size. But that is not the case in this Congress. Right now, there is no guarantee that schools across the country will have funding guaranteed to reduce classroom overcrowding. Some of my colleagues on the Republican side say we don't need to commit money for class size reduction. They say if schools want to hire teachers, let them take the money out of title VI funding. 
   Reducing overcrowding should not be done at the expense of something else. That money should be there--guaranteed to make a positive difference for students. 
   In this debate, two things have been forgotten. First, part of the Federal role is to help disadvantaged students. The class size program is set up to target funding to low-income schools. If you dump that program into a block grant, there is no guarantee that it will be focused toward disadvantaged students. Title I, homeless and migrant education programs are all targeted to ensure that disadvantaged students get the help they need. A block grant offers no guarantees. 
   The second point 
   overlooked in this debate is the importance of accountability. Under a block grant, there is no guarantee this money will go to hire new teachers. 
   Block grants mean less accountability. Right now, we can show that money was spent and how it is making a difference. If the money is block granted, we have no idea if it is making classrooms less crowded. Today, everybody is talking about accountability, and the best way to ensure accountability is to show that Federal dollars are being spent in a specific, targeted way to reach a specific goal. If we put Federal education funding into a block grant, there is no way to keep that money accountable. Class size is just one of the areas in which we need to invest. 
   Let me mention another: school construction and modernization. Today, too many students enter school buildings that are crumbling or that have major safety hazards. In fact, 7 million students attend schools with safety code violations, including the presence of asbestos, lead paint, or radon in ceilings or walls. Almost 16 million students in this country attend schools without proper heating, ventilation, or air-conditioning. And too many of our schools don't have the technological infrastructure to meet our students' needs. For example, in our poorest schools, only 39 percent of classrooms have Internet access. We need to pass legislation that will give local school districts the financial help they need to build new schools and to modernize old ones. 
   I want to turn to teacher quality. We can help ensure that every teacher in America is fully qualified and has the tools and the support to help our children reach their full potential. Today, there are thousands of world-class, high-quality teachers in our schools. They are professionals. They care deeply about the quality of our children's education, and any of us would be lucky to have our children learn from them. But the current system makes it harder and harder for teachers to really do their best. Instead of offering them the support they need to make a difference, the current system puts roadblocks in front of too many teachers. 
   Teachers and parents have told me that the main challenges are the three R's: recruiting great teachers, retaining great teachers, and rewarding great teachers. 
   We need to recruit young people into the teaching profession. We need effective, ongoing, professional development programs that are aligned with local standards and curricula. We need efforts to boost pay for great teachers and to raise respect for educators. In the closing weeks of the 106th session, we should be supporting efforts to improve teacher quality. 
   Finally, the subject of accountability. We should not accept defeat or give up on our Nation's schools. We need to identify schools that need extra help and turn those schools around. 
   It is late in the legislative process, and we are in a rush to end this year's session. Let's remember one thing. America's students didn't create this rush. I am standing here today and I will be fighting to make sure that our students are not penalized because this Senate failed to do its work. I know my colleagues are eager to go home, but we still have time to do the right thing. We still have time to support the work that local educators, students, and parents are doing. The way to do it isn't to bash public schools but to put Federal dollars where they will help the most and to keep those dollars accountable. The way to do that is to invest in things that we know work, such as smaller classes, modern facilities, fully qualified teachers, and accountability. It is not too late to do the right thing. 
   Parents, teachers, and students across this country are counting on us to do our part as a responsible Federal partner. Let's not let them down. 
   Thank you, Mr. President. 
   I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Vermont for his comments. I am looking forward, hopefully, to him chairing the Judiciary Committee next year; so that women such as Bonnie Campbell are not held up for months on end and we actually have a chance to put good, qualified women and minorities into judiciary positions in this country. 
   I also thank the Senator from Vermont for his tremendous work on the Violence Against Women Act, bringing us to a point today where we are finally going to have a vote on this bill, despite the fact there are other parts of this bill that I do not believe should be attached to it. I appreciate his efforts because this is an extremely important bill. 
   I have come to the floor to express my strong support for reauthorizing the Violence Against Women Act and to endorse the pending conference report. In communities across America, the Violence Against Women Act has been an overwhelming success. It has empowered women and children to escape violent relationships, and it has helped to put abusers behind bars. On every account, the Violence Against Women Act deserves to be reauthorized. I urge my colleagues to support this vital legislation. 
   It is unfortunate that reauthorization was allowed to lapse this past month, but I am pleased the Republican leadership has finally agreed that reauthorization must be a priority. I wish we had reached the conclusion earlier in this session. 
   This subject deserves a much more open and extended debate than has been allowed, but I want to take full advantage of the opportunity before us, the chance to reauthorize and strengthen the Violence Against Women Act. VAWA has been nothing short of historic. 
   Not long ago, domestic violence was considered a private family matter. That perception made it very difficult for women to get help and for communities to confront domestic violence. But all of that changed in 1994. I am very proud to have worked to pass the Violence Against Women Act because, for the first time, our Nation recognized domestic violence for what it is--a violent crime and a public health threat. 
   Through the Violence Against Women Act, we created a national strategy for dealing with violence against women. Today, looking back, it is very clear just how revolutionary the act was. For the first time, it established a community-wide response, bringing together cops and prosecutors, shelters and advocates and others on the front lines of domestic violence. It authorized programs to give financial and technical support to police departments to focus on domestic violence and to encourage arrests. It recognized and supported the essential role of the courts in ensuring justice. It provided funding for battered women's shelters and for programs that address the public health impact of domestic violence. 
   VAWA authorized funding for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, for Rape Prevention and Education, and it helped establish a national toll-free hotline for victims of domestic violence. Today, 1-800-799-SAFE offers battered women immediate help. In fact, every month, that hotline receives more than 13,000 calls. Back in 1994, some people wondered whether this unprecedented national strategy would work. Today, 6 years  later, the facts are in and it is clear that the Violence Against Women Act has been a success. Arrests and convictions are up. We have more than doubled funding for battered women's shelters. Since 1994, we have appropriated close to $2 billion for VAWA-related programs. 
   As a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, one of my highest priorities has always been increasing funding for the Violence Against Women Act programs. In communities throughout my State and others, the need is overwhelming, and funding makes a dramatic difference. Working with the chairman of the Subcommittee on Labor, HHS, and Education of the Senate Appropriations Committee, I have seen funding for shelters climb from $10 million to more than $100 million. I know Senator SPECTER has been a strong advocate for the Violence Against Women Act programs. I am pleased that VAWA has always been a bipartisan issue in appropriations. 
   While we have much to be proud of today, we cannot forget that abuse is still too common. In Washington State, my home State, the toll-free domestic violence hotline received more than 37,000 calls between July 1998 and July 1999. We cannot forget that there are still too few resources for women in need. In my State during that same period, 23,806 women and children were turned away from shelters--turned away as they sought help because the resources were not there. 
   We cannot forget that not all communities offer a full range of services, and not all police departments are equipped to handle a life-threatening domestic violence call. 
   The truth is, while the Violence Against Women Act was a historic first step, it was just that, a first step. The time has come for us to build on the foundation created by that act. VAWA offered an immediate response to the threat of violence. Now it is time to address the long-term issues. It is time to confront the long-range economic barriers that trap women and children in violent relationships. 
   I have worked with Senators WELLSTONE and SCHUMER to write and introduce the Battered Women's Economic Security Act. This legislation tears down economic barriers and breaks the cycle of violence. Our bill deals with employment discrimination, insurance discrimination, housing assistance, legal help, and child care. It addresses the punitive elements of the welfare system that can penalize women who are fleeing dangerous situations. It provides additional help to shelters and providers to meet the overwhelming needs of battered women and children. 
   I had hoped we would have been able to reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act in a timely manner and move to addressing those economic issues that I have outlined. Unfortunately, we cannot have that debate today or in this session of Congress. But let me assure my colleagues we will be back in the 107th Congress to fight to put these powerful tools in the hands of victims and their advocates. 
   Before I conclude, I want to say a special word of thanks to the many people who have helped us reach this point today. 
   I thank, again, Senator LEAHY and Senator BIDEN for their leadership. They worked very hard to bring a bipartisan bill to the floor today. 
   I also thank all of the advocates who fought so hard to ensure the success of the Violence Against Women Act and who have been aggressive in urging this Congress to act. Without their support in our communities, VAWA would never have been a success. 
   I thank the Washington State Coalition Against Domestic Violence for its dedicated work. 
   I thank all of the advocates, police officers, and community leaders with whom I have worked since 1994 to implement VAWA and to strengthen this important act. 
   I thank the many shelters and organizations that have opened their facilities to me during this session of Congress, including the Tacoma-Pierce County YWCA, Kitsap Special Assault Victims Investigative Services in Bremerton, the Bellingham YWCA, the Vancouver YWCA Domestic Violence Day Care Shelter, the Spokane Domestic Violence Consortium, the Spokane Women's Drop-In Center, and the people at Vashon Island Domestic Violence Outreach Services. 
   As I have visited with them, I have seen firsthand the services they offer and the challenges they face. I have spoken personally with women who have had their lives changed because of the services offered, and I have been impressed by the progress they are making day in and day out. Those experiences have strengthened my determination to support their work in the Senate. 
   In closing, it is clear the Violence Against Women Act has been a remarkable success. We cannot delay authorization any longer, and I urge my colleagues to vote for this measure. I look forward to working with those in the Senate and those in my State to help build on the progress of the Violence Against Women Act in the next session of Congress. 
   I thank the Chair.

   Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I've come to the floor to join my colleagues in discussing where our annual budgeting process stands. 
   We are just three days away from the start of the new fiscal year, and the Senate is far behind in its work. The resulting rush is leading some to short-circuit our usual appropriations process. Like so many of my colleagues, I am dismayed that Senators are being denied the opportunity to fully consider and debate these appropriations bills. 
   I want to commend Senator BYRD for his comments today. Senator BYRD is once again speaking for the United States Senate. His comments are neither Republican nor Democrat. With his usual elegance and candor, Senator BYRD is championing this institution, and we should all commend him for that. The Senate that he defends so passionately is one that works for both parties; works for all Senators; and most importantly, works for the American people.  
   Time and again during my eight years of service in this body, I have made the walk from my office to this floor. And each time, I bring with me a certain excitement and anticipation for the great opportunity the people of Washington state have given me to represent them as we debate issues from education to foreign policy to health care. 
   Unfortunately, there have been very few opportunities to come to this floor and engage in meaningful debate. Too often, the majority has sought to either stifle or deny debate on the issues Americans care about. On the rare occasions when we have had debates, they have not resulted in meaningful legislation that has a chance of being signed into law. 
   For example, the Senate spent several weeks debating the Elementary and Secondary Education act. We debated the issues, and we cast tough votes on the ESEA bill. But, for some reason, the bill was shelved by the majority. Now it looks certain to die as the Congress tries to adjourn quickly in this election year. 
   As we watch the clock tick toward the end of the fiscal year this weekend, only two of the 13 appropriations bills have been signed into law. We now find ourselves in an unnecessary impasse. The breakdown in this year's appropriations process did not happen overnight. It is not merely the result of election eve politicking, or jockeying for position between the Executive and Legislative branches, although there are plenty of both going on. 
   No, the breakdown of the fiscal year 2001 appropriations process can be traced back to the opening days of this session of Congress in January. Back then, the House and Senate leadership promptly fell into disarray over the handling of the President's request for a supplemental spending bill. You may recall that the President requested $5 billion in supplemental fiscal year 2000 funding. The House subsequently passed a $12.8 billion supplemental funding bill--more than twice what the President had requested. The Senate Appropriations Committee, at the behest of the Senate Majority Leader, shelved plans to draw up a separate supplemental funding bill. Instead, the Senate attached a total of $8.6 billion in supplemental funding onto three regular appropriations bills--Military Construction, Foreign Operations, and Agriculture appropriations. The Majority Leader's plan was to have all three bills enacted into law by the Fourth of July holiday. Needless to say, things did not quite go as planned. 
   Despite weeks of congressional wrangling, the three bills in the Senate could not be reconciled with the one bill in the House. Finally--in desperation--the House and Senate ended up jamming $11.2 billion in supplemental funding into the conference on the FY 2001 Military Construction Appropriations Bill. Much of that funding had never seen the light of day in either the House or Senate. The conference report was approved on June 30, and became the first of the FY 2001 appropriations bill signed into law. With the exception of the swift and relatively smooth passage of the Defense Appropriations Bill a month later, the FY 2001 appropriations process has gone from bad to worse. We now find ourselves in the intolerable position of having 11 of the 13 appropriations bills still pending--with two days to go before the end of the fiscal year, and no clear game plan in sight. The House has passed all of the regular appropriations bills. And the Senate Appropriations Committee--on which I serve--has reported all 13 regular appropriations bills. But only 10 of these 13 bills have been passed by the Senate. Once again, desperation is setting in. The focus is shifting from the flow of open debate on the Senate floor to the closed doors of the conference committees. 
   Just last week, the Senate leadership attempted to attach the Treasury and General Government Appropriations bill--which the Senate has never considered--to the Legislative Branch conference report, and pass them as a package deal. The Senate was wise to reject that approach. The Senate should have an opportunity to fully consider these three significant appropriations bills. To abandon the reasoned debate this chamber is known for would represent a full surrender by this body of our responsibilities to the American people. 
   Mr. President, there are many pressing issues from programs for veterans healthcare and the courts to the National Weather Service. We should be able to debate these funding plans and then vote for or against them. Mr. President, it doesn't have to be this way. The Senate still has time to take up the remaining appropriations bills, debate them, amend them, and send them to the President. They may be contentious. But that is precisely why they must be aired in the light of day before the entire Senate and not swept into law under the cover of an unrelated appropriations conference report. 
   If the Senate acts promptly, the conferees will have ample time to complete their work, and report back to the full House and Senate. As a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, I am acutely aware of our responsibilities to the people of this nation when it comes to appropriating taxpayers' dollars. I take that responsibility very seriously. The people have a right to know what Congress is doing with their money. And members of Congress have a responsibility to appropriate money wisely. 
   We cannot do our jobs or meet our responsibilities, if we delegate our work to a handful of appropriators hammering out a conference agreement, or to a closed circle of congressional leaders and White House officials huddling over a conference table. 
   Mr. President, we are poised to pass a Continuing Resolution that will keep the government operating through October 6. I believe that if we could put aside political posturing, partisan bickering, and retaliatory tactics for just one week, just one week, we could complete work on the appropriations bills, in an orderly and responsible fashion, and close out this Congress. We may not have accomplished all that we would have wished to accomplish. But I am confident that continued bickering over the appropriations process in the waning days of the 106th Congress will not improve the climate for any other legislation to move forward. 
   Mr. President, the American people deserve more than this mess from their elected leaders. I know the Senate can do better. In the days ahead, I urge my colleagues to work with our leaders and with the leadership of the Appropriations Committee, to tackle the remaining appropriations bills and conference reports, to debate, to vote, and to complete the work that we have been charged to do. 
   Though time is running out, it is not too late to make these spending decisions in the most responsible way, and that is what I am calling on my colleagues to do.

   Mrs. MURRAY. I thank my colleague from Louisiana for his efforts in making sure we pass a bill that will improve the safety of family and children who work or play near pipelines in this country. He is right; the House has an obligation now to take up the bill that we have passed in the Senate and move it forward. I thank him and I agree with his comments. 
   We have been joined by the chair of the Commerce Committee, Senator MCCAIN, who has done a tremendous job in moving this legislation forward. I personally thank him, as well. 
   It has been 16 months since a pipeline exploded in Bellingham, Washington and killed 3 young people. Back then, few Americans knew about the dangers of our Nation's aging pipelines. But in the past year--especially after the explosion in New Mexico last month--it became clear that this Congress had to do more to protect the public. 
   As my colleagues know, it is difficult to reform any major industry in just one year. But it was clear that we couldn't wait any longer to make pipelines safer. We in the Senate had a responsibility to protect the public, and I am pleased that the bill we passed earlier this month will go a long way to making pipelines safer. It is a dramatic improvement over the status quo. 
   That's why I've been so dismayed by what has happened in the House in recent weeks. The House of Representatives has not passed--or even marked up--any pipeline bill, but some Members have already called our bill inadequate. They also claim that they can pass a better bill this year--with just a few scheduled legislative days left in this Congress. I don't see it happening. 
   I have worked on this issue for over a year and that's why I want to address those claims--because they are based on three incorrect assumptions. The first fallacy is that the Senate bill will not improve safety. We worked long and hard over many months to pass a strong bill. And this bill will improve safety. 
   Let's look at some of the provisions. 
   Expanding the public's right to know about pipeline hazards; 
   Requiring pipeline operators to test their pipelines; 
   Requiring pipeline operators to certify their personnel; 
   Requiring smaller spills to be reported; 
   Raising the penalties for safety violators; 
   Investing in new technology to improve pipeline safety; 
   Protecting whistle blowers; 
   Increasing state oversight; and 
   Increasing funding for safety efforts. 
   These are clear improvements over the status quo and they will make pipelines safer. This is not a perfect bill, but we should not make the perfect the enemy of the good. Let's take the steps we can now to improve pipeline safety. 
   Some also suggest that the Senate bill relies on the Office of Pipeline Safety too much. Now it is clear that OPS has not done its job in the past. That is why this bill requires OPS to carry out congressional mandates. And we in Congress have a responsibility to hold OPS accountable for doing its job. I intend to remain vigilant in this area. 
   Our bill includes more resources for the agency. And today public scrutiny on the agency--especially after a report by the General Accounting Office and a report I requested from DOT's inspector general--have put the agency under a microscope. I am confident that OPS today has a renewed commitment to safety. And I am pleased our bill includes the right amount of new resources and tools to make pipelines safer. 
   Let me turn to another assumption that has been made by some. 
   They suggest this bill could be amended significantly this year. That's a long process even under normal circumstances. And this year there are only a few days left. I don't see how it could happen this year. 
   So some critics say--we'll start again next year--we'll do better next year. That means it will be at least a year--maybe longer before the issue is even brought up again. 
   And how can we have so much faith that we'll get anything stronger--or anything at all--under a new Congress and a new President? 
   Let me ask a simple question: 
   Would you take that bet if your family's safety depended on it? I wouldn't. And I don't think we can shirk our responsibility to protect the public this year. 
   Before I finish, I do want to say something about those who have raised concerns about the Senate bill. They are good people with good motives. 
   In some cases, they have paid too high a price. They want safer pipelines. That is exactly what I want. Unfortunately, here in Congress--their position ends up ``making the perfect the enemy of the good.'' And that means no reform at all. 
   Looking for some ``better bill'' really means no bill at all this year. Rejecting the Senate bill really means accepting the inadequate, unsafe status quo for at least another year. I don't want another American family to look at this Congress and say, ``why did you drop the ball when you were so much closer to improving safety?'' 
   Passing the Senate bill means we will finally get on the road to making pipelines safer. Once we're on that road we can always make course corrections. But we've got to get on that road to start with and that's why I urge my colleagues in the House to pass the Senate bill immediately. 
   We've got a strong bill. Let's put it into law. 
   Let me make it clear: It is critical that the House take up this bill this year. Senator MCCAIN has done an outstanding job. We owe the people in my State, New Mexico, and other States that have had accidents, to do the right thing this year. I encourage this Congress to act. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill that would designate the existing United States Federal Courthouse for the Western District of Washington in Seattle, Washington, as the ``William Kenzo Nakamura United States Courthouse.'' William Nakamura was born in 1922, and grew up in Seattle, Washington. He attended public schools and was a student at the University of Washington when he and 110,000 other Japanese Americans were removed from their communities and forced into internment camps. 
   For many, the disgrace of the internment camps and the injustice of that American policy fostered resentment and anger. Rather than succumb to hate, William Kenzo Nakamura chose to fight for the very country that had treated him unjustly. He enlisted in the 442d Regimental Combat Team, which went on to become the most decorated military team in U.S. history. While fighting in Italy, Pfc. William Nakamura was killed on July 4, 1944. At the time of his death, he was providing cover for his retreating platoon. Earlier that day, he had also gone beyond the call of duty and single-handedly destroyed a machine-gun nest. 
   Following his death, Nakamura's commanding officer nominated him for the Medal of Honor. According to Army policy at the time, Japanese Americans could not receive the Medal of Honor. Instead, Pfc. Nakamura was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross, the military's second highest honor. This past June, Pfc. Nakamura and 21 other Asian-American veterans of World War II were finally honored with the Congressional Medal of Honor. Senator INOUYE, who served in the same unit as Mr. Nakamura, was one of those who received the Congressional Medal of Honor that day. I was proud to be present at the White House for the ceremony. 
   I am pleased that both of the Medal of Honor recipients in Congress are original cosponsors of the bill: Senators INOUYE and KERRY. I am also honored to have my Washington state colleague, Senator GORTON, as an original cosponsor. Congressman MCDERMOTT is sponsoring this legislation in the House, and I thank him for his efforts. Like many Asian-American veterans, Nakamura didn't hesitate when his country called. He and many others went to war and gave their lives for freedoms which they and their families were denied at home. 
   Mr. President, we can't undo the injustice suffered by Japanese-Americans during World War II, but we can give these noble Americans the recognition they deserve. The William Kenzo Nakamura Courthouse will serve as a permanent reminder that justice must serve all Americans equally. I urge my colleagues to support this piece of legislation.

   Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I commend my colleagues this evening for passing the much-needed pipeline safety bill. 
   For too long, communities across the country--in tragedy after tragedy--have felt the impact of our Nation's inadequate pipeline safety standards. 
   Today, the Senate has responded with a strong bill that will help make our pipelines safer. 
   As pleased as I am today, I am reminded of another much darker day--June 10, 1999. 
   On that day, a gasoline pipeline exploded in Bellingham, WA, killing three young people, shattering a community's faith, and setting us on the road of safety reform. 
   I know that we can't undo what happened in Bellingham. We can't restore the loss of those families. But with this bill, we are putting the lessons we learned in Bellingham into law--and taking a first step toward ensuring America's pipelines are safe. 
   Unfortunately, it has taken another fatal pipeline explosion to reach this day. But it is clear that the tragedy in New Mexico raised public awareness and increased the pressure on Congress to pass this bill. 
   This bill will go a long way toward improving pipeline safety. Back in January--when I introduced my own pipeline safety bill--I outlined the areas that needed reform. I am proud that this bill embodies the principles I have been working for. 
   First, this bill will improve the qualifications and training of pipeline personnel. It requires employees to demonstrate an ability to do their job. And it requires periodic reexamination of pipeline personnel. Second, this bill improves pipeline inspections and prevention practices. It requires operators to submit pipeline integrity management plans, which State and local officials can evaluate and recommend changes to. 
   These plans will include: internal inspections, evaluation criteria, measures to prevent and mitigate unintended releases, and other safety activities. 
   Third, and importantly, this bill expands the public's right-to-know about problems with pipelines. It requires operators to make information about the pipelines and their safety practices available to local officials, emergency responders, and the public--including posting information on the Internet. It also requires more pipeline accidents to be reported to the Office of Pipeline Safety, by lowering the reporting threshold from 200 gallons to 5 gallons. 
   Fourth, this bill raises the penalties for safety violators. It doubles the current civil penalties for noncompliance, and it lifts the caps on maximum penalties. 
   Fifth, this bill enables States to expand their safety efforts. This bill allows the Secretary of Transportation  to enter into agreements that will allow States to: ``participate in special investigations involving incidents or new construction'' and to ``assume additional inspection or investigatory duties.'' 
   Sixth, this bill invests in new technology to improve safety. It recognizes the need for R&D for new inspection devices and practices, and it authorizes a coordinated research program. 
   Seventh, this bill provides protections for those who blow the whistle on unsafe practices. 
   Eighth, this bill increases funding for safety efforts. It authorizes spending $13 million more on pipeline safety than we spend today. 
   Finally, this bill recognizes State citizen advisory committees and allows for their funding. These State citizen advisory committees would make recommendations to the Secretary of Transportation. The Secretary will be required to respond--in writing--to those recommendations. And, the Secretary would have to detail what actions, if any, will be taken to implement those recommendations. 
   Further, the bill would allow appropriations for these State advisory committees. 
   This is a sound bill. Under this bill, pipelines will be inspected. Operators will be qualified. Whistleblowers will be protected, and violators will be penalized. Pipeline companies will have to develop comprehensive safety and inspection plans, and States will get new authority. Citizen groups will have a role, and the public will have a right to know about the pipelines in their own communities. 
   This bill does not only raise pipeline safety standards. It gives us the tools, the enforcements, and the funding to ensure that pipeline companies reach those standards. 
   I want my constituents and my colleagues to know that I plan on remaining vigilant on this issue and ensuring that future administrations carry out the congressional mandate. 
   I do want to recognize tonight a few people who have helped make this day possible. First are the families of the victims of the Bellingham explosion, Frank and Mary King, Katherine Dalen and Stephen Tsiorvas, Marlene Robinson and Bruce Brabec. They have testified and worked hard. They have been courageous, and they were constant reminders of what has been lost and what this legislation will help protect. 
   Second, I thank the people of Bellingham, especially Mayor Mark Asmundson, who has done more than anyone I know to raise awareness about pipeline hazards. 
   I recognize the work of our great Governor Gary Locke. And third, I thank those in the administration who have supported our efforts; in particular, Vice President GORE, who learned about this issue during a visit to my State and who got the administration's proposal to Congress. 
   I also thank Transportation Secretary Rodney Slater. At my request, he promptly stationed a pipeline inspector in my State after the Bellingham explosion, and he has worked with us on this issue for more than a year. His leadership has been critical to our efforts. I thank him this evening. 
   I also thank DOT's Inspector General Kenneth Mead, Kelly Coyner, who is the administrator of DOT's Office of Research and Special Programs Administration, and the director of the Office of Pipeline Safety, Stacey Gerard, and her predecessor, Richard Felder. 
   I thank Jim Hall, Chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board. 
   Many groups played a role in moving this process forward. I thank the National Pipeline Reform Coalition, SAFE Bellingham, and the Cascade Columbia Alliance. I also thank everyone who testified at the numerous hearings, and the many Federal and State officials who have worked on this issue. 
   Finally, I thank my colleagues in the Senate, especially Commerce Committee Chairman JOHN MCCAIN, who has been stalwart in his support and has been working with us every step of the way. I thank my colleague Senator GORTON and his staff who have worked with us diligently on this issue; Senator HOLLINGS; Senator INOUYE, all the members of the Commerce Committee and their staffs, and Dale Learn from my office. 
   Senator BINGAMAN should also be thanked for his leadership. He made the bill stronger by adding a needed research and development amendment, which I am pleased to cosponsor. 
   I thank the many reporters and editorial writers who helped raise public awareness about the need to improve pipeline safety. 
   While we have cleared a major hurdle, our work is not finished. This bill must now pass the House of Representatives and be signed by the President. We don't have much time. Let's use today's passage to energize the efforts of the House so we can improve pipeline safety in communities across America this year.

   Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I am introducing legislation today to provide a long overdue honor to a distinguished group of American veterans. The United States Naval Armed Guard made heroic contributions to our naval efforts in World War I and World War II and the time has come for a grateful nation to recognize these brave veterans. 
   The Armed Guard consisted of the officers, gunners, radiomen, signalmen and later medics and radarmen who were placed on cargo ships to protect them from armed assault.

   Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, for several years the people of the Pacific Northwest have been working to save several wild salmon and steelhead runs that are currently threatened with extinction. 
   Today, the administration presented a number of proposals for how we can recover these species. 
   Specifically, the administration released its draft biological opinion for technical review by the four affected States and the region's tribes. 
   The administration also released an updated All-H paper--also known as the Basin-wide Recovery Strategy. 
   This paper details proposals in the areas of hatchery reform, harvest levels, hydroelectric power generation, and habitat recovery. 
   I take this opportunity to talk about how we can work together to restore the threatened and endangers species of the Columbia Basin. 
   From the ancient history of Native Americans to the explorations of Lewis and Clark nearly 200 years ago, the natural bounty of the Pacific Northwest has always been a source of pride. 
   We have been blessed with great rivers--including the Columbia, the Yakima and the Snake. Over the years, we have drawn from these rivers. 
   Dams have provided us with vital hydroelectric power--forever improving the quality of life in our region and providing an engine for our robust economic development. 
   These rivers have helped generations of farmers from Longview to Walla Walla by providing water for irrigation. And, they have provided a watery highway, allowing us to bring our products to market. 
   Clearly, Washington state has benefitted from our rivers and natural resources. 
   I am proud that today we are home to the best airplane manufacturer in the world. We are home to the best software company in the world. We grow the best apples. Mr. President, our future is bright. 
   But Mr. President, this progress has come at a price. Our wild salmon stocks are struggling. In fact, the National Marine Fisheries Service has listed 12 wild salmon and steelhead stocks in the Columbia basin as threatened or endangered. 
   In addition, several butt-trout and sturgeon populations are also threatened. 
   Let me be clear. Those listings mean that right now--we are on the path of extinction. 
   So the question before us is: Do we have the will to come together and choose a different path--the path of recovery? 
   I believe that we do. I believe that the ingenuity and optimism of the people of Washington State will allow us to meet this challenge. 
   And I am proud of the tough decisions that people all across my State--from farmers and Native Americans to sport fishermen and the fishing industry--have made so far. 
   But it will be difficult. Unfortunately, the current debate about saving salmon makes finding a real solution even more difficult. 
   The debate today is too short-sighted, it is too narrow, and it's too partisan. 
   When I say the debate has been short-sighted, I mean that this isn't an issue that's going to be resolved in one month or one year or even one generation. 
   We are dealing with an issue that has a long history. 
   In the Pacific Northwest, salmon are part of our heritage, our culture and our economy. 
   We know from the oral history of Native Americans the significance that salmon played in the lives of Northwesterners as long as 12,000 years ago. 
   The question before us today is: Will salmon still spawn in these rivers in the next 1,000 years, the next 100 years, or even 10 years from now? 
   Salmon are a link to our past, and if they are going to be part of our future, we will have to find solutions that look beyond the next season or the next election. 
   I am committed to make sure we take the long view when it comes to saving salmon. 
   In addition, the debate has been too narrow. If someone from another part of the country heard the debate, they would think that only one thing affects salmon--dams. 
   We know that dams are just one of four factors that affect salmon. It may help to think of the challenge before us as a table--a table with four legs. 
   Each one of those legs must hold its share of the weight. If one leg is too short, the table will be out of balance.  
   We know that salmon are impacted by four variables. They are hydropower, hatcheries, harvest, and habitat. 
   Let me start with hydropower--or dams. 
   Mr. President, I have long said that we need to develop and implement a comprehensive recovery strategy before we consider the removal of dams. 
   I am pleased that the administration has taken this first step forward and provided the foundation for such a plan. 
   I am also pleased that in doing so the administration is clearly moving us beyond the false debate of dams or no dams. 
   The issue has never been that simple. To be sure, the Ice Harbor, Lower Monumental, Little Goose, and Lower Granite dams have--like other dams throughout the region--hampered the ability of salmon to migrate from their original river homes, to the ocean, and back again to spawn. 
   The reality is that we have 12 listed species throughout the Columbia basin. Four of these stocks are in the Snake River. The other eight are on the Columbia and Willamette Rivers. 
   Removal of the Snake River dams is of minimal value to the recovery of the eight listed Columbia and Willamette runs. 
   Furthermore, while removal of the dams would benefit the Snake runs, NMFS has found removal may not be necessary for recovery and that removal alone would probably not be sufficient. 
   We still have to deal with the issues related to recovering these particular stocks and the hydro system needs to be examined and upgraded to ease fish passage to and from the ocean. 
   We need to address the challenges posed dams pose for fish survival. 
   We must employ a comprehensive, basin-wide approach that, regardless of the ultimate decision regarding the dams, addresses all of the complex issues surrounding salmon recovery. 
   Mr. President, I fear that some who have focused solely on dam removal have failed to consider what will be necessary under a comprehensive recovery approach. 
   We need to, as the administration's draft plan suggests, establish performance standards for recovery, and we need to achieve those goals. 
   Bypassing the dams will remain a subject to this debate if we fail to aggressively tackle the issues related to survival of fish through the hydro system. It is a reality we must deal with. 
   Next I'd like to turn to the second factor that affects salmon recovery--hatcheries. 
   We must minimize the impacts of hatchery practices that present challenges to the wild stocks, namely: the introduction of disease; competition for food; and dilution of the gene pool. 
   Further, as the administration suggests, there is a possibility that we could use hatcheries as a way to bolster weak stocks on a short-term basis by using a little common sense. 
   By choosing to utilize wild, native fish stocks, hatcheries can be transformed from a hindrance to recovery to a help. 
   Mr. President, reform of the hatchery program will be expensive. However, there is a fair amount of agreement on what reform is necessary. 
   The Northwest Power Planning Council's report, Artificial Production Review, has given us a basis for action. It is now an issue of finding the funds and prioritizing where these funds should be spent. 
   The next factor is harvest. This relates to several controversial issues that are subject to both international and tribal treaties. 
   The Pacific Salmon Treaty with Canada and the treaties with Northwest tribes clearly obligate us to recover salmon to harvestable levels. Under those treaties we, as Americans, have obligations we must meet. Already, many have sacrificed because of the declines in salmon runs. 
   The tribal fishermen who have depended on the salmon since time immemorial to feed their families and celebrate their culture has sacrificed. 
   The sports fisherman has sacrificed with the virtual elimination of chinook season. 
   The commercial fishing family in Ilwaco has sacrificed. 
   In a couple of years, after completing the buy-back commitments under the Pacific Salmon Treaty, there could be as few as 600 active non-tribal commercial licenses, compared to the roughly 10,000 licenses in the 1970s. 
   As we look forward at the sacrifices we will need to make in the future to help recover the wild stocks, we should never forget those who have already seen their livelihood, tradition, family, and community impacted by the dwindling numbers of returning fish. 
   We need to promote selective fishing that allows the catching of non-listed species while providing for the release of listed ones. 
   We also need to continue to support efforts to reduce the number of federal and state issued fishing licenses by buying back those licenses. 
   The recently signed Pacific Salmon Treaty, which Vice President GORE played such an important role in finalizing, calls for exactly these types of measures. 
   We need to redouble our efforts to prevent overfishing and manage this resource in a responsible way. 
   Finally, as controversial and difficult as the issues related to the hydro system will be, habitat promises to be every bit as thorny and complex an issue to tackle. 
   Mr. President, in this equation, by and large, habitat equals water and impacts to water quality. 
   As anyone familiar with agriculture can tell you, especially in the West, water is gold. It is the stuff of life. 
   It makes or breaks communities, both their ability to maintain what they have and to sustain and manage their growth. 
   Water in the West is both the great opportunity provider and limiter. Our water law dates back to the earliest days of settlement, and it has struggled to meet the demands of the modern era. 
   We need to take steps now to prevent the continued destruction of critical habitat and work to restore habitat that has been degraded over time. 
   Mr. President, the key for fish, as it is for people, is access to cool, clean water. Fish require a sufficient quantity of unpolluted water; that means encouraging land use practices near critical river habitat that are consistent with the needs of the fish. 
   Mr. President, these are the four areas we must address. All four are important and must be part of the debate. 
   Addressing issues related to the hydro system, reforming hatchery practices, managing harvest, and husbanding important habitat will not be easy. But we don't have a choice. Allowing salmon to become extinct is not an option. 
   Mr. President, at the start of my remarks, I said that the debate so far has been too short sighted and too narrow, and I have explained how we can take a longer view and how we can look at the broad range of factors that affect salmon. 
   Before I close I would like to explain why I think that the debate over salmon recovery has been too political to the detriment of saving salmon and doing what needs to be done to keep the families in our region whole. 
   When partisan politics are injected into such a complex issue, it has the effect of dividing people--rather than bringing them together. 
   Unfortunately, we have heard too many people who only say what they don't want to happen, who only seek to place blame, who heighten the rhetoric, who lead by creating fear rather than hope, and who never commit to a plan. 
   That is not going to help us save salmon or the people in the impacted communities of the Pacific Northwest. 
   Saying ``no'' to everything, without offering a constructive plan, is not leadership. And it will take leadership to recover our salmon stocks and keep our commitments to the people of the Northwest. 
   Mr. President, I commit to work in a positive fashion with anyone who is genuinely interested in saving salmon. 
   If you are serious about solutions, I am ready to work together to find them. And I am willing to play my part in our shared responsibility. 
   I will continue to seek Federal funding to support new and continuing projects. I will strive to maintain my own communication with affected communities, individuals, and interest groups. In addition, I will promote better communication between federal agencies and other parties when this communication breaks down.  
   In short, I commit to being a positive partner with all those who understand the need for tough decisions and want to move forward to real recovery. 
   It is time to rise above the current debate, which traps people into false choices while letting the possibility of other solutions slip away from us. 
   Mr. President, this is not an issue that is going to be solved by November 7, 2000. This is an issue that will be with us for years--perhaps generations--to come. 
   What we need now are public servants and private citizens with both the will and the vision to sit down, roll up their sleeves, and figure out how to move forward. 
   Right now we are on the path to salmon extinction. Anyone who delays progress keeps us on that path. Anyone who divides rather than unites, brings extinction closer. 
   Mr. President, as we proceed on this issue, I wish to state my willingness to work with the next President, with the tribal governments, with my colleagues in the Congress, with the State and local governments, and with private citizens to address the important issues related to recovering wild salmon. 
   And we can make progress while maintaining our region's economic viability. 
   The opportunity the administration has given us today is to move forward in a constructive way. 
   They have presented a plan that moves beyond the debate about bypassing dams and onto the issues we really need to focus on. 
   While I may disagree with some of the specifics of this plan, it does provide a comprehensive roadmap for how we can resolve these difficult issues. 
   I believe if we take the comprehensive approach, we will save salmon and steelhead runs; we will be able to produce essential power; we will be able to meet the needs of our farmers, and we will keep water healthy for our children's children. 
   Mr. President, as I conclude I want to make one final point. This really isn't just about fish or dams. It is about the type of world we want to live in. We have a choice about the legacy we leave for our grandchildren. 
   The choice I have called for today is the choice to leave future generations clean rivers--full of salmon. 
   The choice I've called for today is the choice to show our grandchildren that no matter how big our difference may appear we can work together and be good stewards of our land. 
   That is the choice I hope we will make. 
   The other path leaves a far different legacy. A legacy that leaves our grandchildren polluted waters--resources divided from nature. and even worse--people divided from each other. 
   Mr. President, that is not the legacy I want to leave. We cannot shrink from this challenge. 
   Let's use today's reports as a tool to help us move forward toward real salmon recovery.

   Mrs. Murray. Mr. President, I've come to the floor this evening to share with my colleagues recent developments on the pipeline safety legislation. I am frustrated that to date we've been unable to come to agreement on a package of amendments that would ensure this critical legislation passes this year. I praise the efforts of the chairman of the Commerce Committee, Senator MCCAIN, and the committee's ranking member, Senator HOLLINGS, for their steadfast resolution in dealing with this issue. 
   As most of my colleagues know, I've been working for more than a year to improve pipeline safety standards. Millions of miles of pipelines run through our communities, next to our schools and under our homes. As the deadly pipeline explosion in Bellingham, WA, on June 10, 1999, that killed 3 young boys, showed us, pipelines are not as safe as they could be. 
   Since the Bellingham explosion, I have been working with officials at all levels of government, industry representatives, environmentalists, state and federal regulators, and concerned citizens to identify ways to improve pipeline safety in our nation. 
   It has been an eye-opening experience. I've uncovered a history of loose regulation with insufficient safety standards, inadequately trained pipeline operators, and a public that is uninformed of the threat that exists. 
   To date, I have focused on the problems associated with liquid gas pipelines. The pipe that ruptured and resulted in the tragic deaths of the three young people in my state was a liquid pipeline. What most people don't know is that natural gas pipelines are far more deadly and injure many more people. 
   From 1986 to 1999, liquid pipeline accidents, according to the U.S. Department of Transportation, resulted in 35 deaths and 235 injuries. In contrast, natural gas distribution and transmission pipelines in that same time period have resulted in 296 deaths and injured 1,357 people. The property damage that has resulted from these incidence totals nearly $1 billion. 
   Some examples of recent deadly natural gas pipelines include: 
   A 1998 natural gas explosion in St. Cloud, Minnesota that destroyed six buildings, killed four people and injured 14 others: 
   A 1997 Citizens Gas natural gas pipeline in Indianapolis that ruptured and ignited, destroying 6 homes and damaging 65 others properties. One person was tragically killed. Luckily this event occurred mid-day while many people were at work and school, otherwise it is likely that more fatalities would have occurred in that family neighborhood; and 
   A 1994 natural gas explosion in Allentown, Pennsylvania that killed one person and injured 66 others. 
   These are just three of many. Pipelines are dangerous, especially natural gas lines. We need to reform the system and put teeth in the regulation to ensure that these accidents are reduced dramatically. 
   The Office of Pipeline Safety oversees more than 157,000 miles of pipelines which transport hazardous liquids and more than 2.2 million miles of natural gas lines throughout the country. While these pipelines perform a vital service by bringing us the fuel we need to heat our homes and power our cars, they can also pose safety hazards. 
   That is why I introduced S. 2004, the Pipeline Safety Act of 2000, on January 27, 2000. In April, the administration and Senator MCCAIN, along with myself and Senator GORTON, also introduced alternative pipeline safety bills. All of these bills focus on expanding local input in pipeline safety matters and strengthening community ``right to know'' provisions, improving pipeline integrity and inspection practices, and increasing our research and development efforts. 
   On June 15, 2000, the Senate Commerce Committee discussed and deliberated the McCain-Murray-Gorton bill. As I stated before, this bill incorporates most of my priorities and is a positive step toward improving pipeline safety. The committee reported by bill without dissent. 
   Events since that time have proven less hopeful. Naturally, there were concerns with the bill as reported out of committee--and again--I appreciate the indulgence of the chair and ranking member as we have sought to negotiate through these difficult issues. Working with Senator GORTON and the Commerce Committee, we have come very close to compromise. Many issues have been resolved; there are only a few minor ones left. 
   I fear, however, that we may be coming to an impasse in our negotiations. I want my colleagues and the industry to know, I will not let the interests of the few strip the many of their right to safe communities. 
   Mr. President, the reforms we have called for are common sense measures. They will make our communities safer and allow everyone to enjoy the benefits of a modern pipeline infrastructure. 
   The reasons for delay are indefensible. I encourage my colleagues to consider what the stalling on this important issue could mean to communities in their State. It means, tragically, more unnecessary damage to life and property. 
   I knew this process would be difficult, but I am concerned at the point where we find ourselves today. If we can't accomplish this soon, I want my colleagues to know, I promise I will be creative in my approach to achieving meaningful pipeline safety legislation this year and find other ways to enact these extremely important reforms. 
   I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, as my colleagues know, I had to return home to Washington state on Thursday of last week to attend the funeral of Mr. Bernie Whitebear. Unfortunately, I missed a series of roll call votes on H.R. 4461, the fiscal year 2001 agriculture appropriations bill, and the vote on the Conference Report of H.R. 4810, marriage tax penalty legislation. I wanted to take this opportunity to state for the Record how I would have voted had I been present. 
   On Roll Call Vote Number 221, the Harkin Amendment Number 3938, I would have voted ``Yea.'' 
   On Roll Call Vote Number 222, the Wellstone Amendment Number 3919, I would have voted ``Yea.'' 
   On Roll Call Vote Number 223, the Specter Amendment Number 3958, I would have voted ``Yea.'' 
   On Roll Call Vote Number 224, on the question of whether the Durbin Amendment Number 3980 is germane to H.R. 4461, I would have voted ``Yea.'' 
   On Roll Call Vote Number 225, on final passage of H.R. 4461, I would have voted ``Yea.''

   Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise to introduce a resolution that has  passed the Senate for the past four years unanimously. My resolution, which I am introducing today with Senator WARNER and 31 original cosponsors establishes October 17, 2000, as a ``Day of National Concern about Young People and Gun Violence.'' For the last several years, I have sponsored this legislation. I am pleased that Senator WARNER has joined me again in leading the cosponsorship drive as we pledge to our young people across the nation that we support their strong efforts to help stop the violence in their own schools and communities. I thank Senator WARNER for his help and partnership. 
   Sadly, this resolution has special meaning for all of us after the tragic events that occurred in the last couple of years. School shootings across the nation have paralyzed communities and shocked the country. In recent years, we've seen school shootings from Mississippi to Oregon. In fact, just two weeks ago, a thirteen year old boy in Seattle, Washington, opened fire in a crowded cafeteria at his junior high school. Luckily no one was hurt. These events have touched us all. Adults and young people alike have been horrified by the violence that has occurred in our schools, which should be a safe haven for our children. We are left wondering what we can do to prevent these tragedies. 
   I am again introducing this resolution because I am convinced the best way to prevent gun violence is by reaching out to individual children and helping them make the right decisions. This resolution establishes a special day that gives parents, teachers, government leaders, service clubs, police departments, and others a way to focus on the problems caused by gun violence. It also empowers young people to take affirmative steps to end this violence by encouraging them to take a pledge not to use guns to resolve disputes.

    Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, it is with great admiration that I rise to pay tribute to Mr. Bernie Whitebear, of Seattle, Washington, who passed away at the age of 62 on Sunday, July 16, 2000. 
   A long-standing advocate and leader in the fight for tribal self-determination, Bernie Whitebear was an outstanding role-model for tribal and non-tribal people alike. Known for his vision, humor and commitment, he lives on in the minds and hearts of everyone who knew him. 
   Bernie Whitebear was born on September 27, 1937 on the Colville Indian Reservation in Eastern Washington. Born into a large family, Bernie grew up confronting many of the barriers facing reservation children, including poverty and discrimination. 
   As an adult, he moved to Seattle, attended the University of Washington and worked as an engineer for Boeing. He later joined the Army as a paratrooper in the 101st Airborne Division and served as a Green Beret. 
   During the activism of the late 1960's, Bernie Whitebear emerged as one of the central tribal leaders in the Pacific Northwest and was a tireless advocate for American Indian recognition and empowerment. We often remember his social action, seen through his leadership in the ``invasion'' of Fort Lawton in Seattle in 1970. Bernie and others occupied the Fort Lawton property after plans were announced to list the Fort as surplus property for the city to designate as a park. He felt local tribes had a historic right to the land, which could be better used as a central service base for Seattle's largely unserved urban Indian population. 
   The 3-month occupation, civil arrests and resulting media attention prompted Congress to order the city of Seattle to negotiate a settlement, which included a 99-year lease on a 20-acre parcel for Whitebear's group. The settlement provided space for construction of the Daybreak Star Art Center, which currently stands in Discovery Park. 
   I want to share with the Senate one of my favorite memories of Bernie Whitebear. Bernie had invited me to attend the Mini-Pow Wow in my state on February 7, 1998. He asked me to stop by to talk about the People's Lodge, to see the artwork, and to have a quick look at some of the traditional dances. I told Bernie I would stop by, but that I only had a short while because I had a lot of events I needed to attend that day. 
   I remember when I arrived at the University of Washington Bernie welcomed me with his big bright smile and an outstretched hand. We watched some of the traditional dances, and then I realized that if I didn't leave soon I would be late for my next event. It was one of those days when I was trying to meet as many people as possible. Well Bernie didn't let me just meet the people at the Mini-Pow Wow, he made me stay and understand them. He started by introducing me to everyone in the room. 
   Then Bernie leaned over to me and explained that it was customary for a visiting United States Senator to move to the front of the dancing group. You know, it was one of the many Native American traditions Bernie told me about that always sounded a little invented to me. Like another old tradition he told me about: That anytime a U.S. Senator stepped foot in Discovery Park he or she had to pay a visit to the Daybreak Star Center. Well there was Bernie asking me to move to the front, and who could say no to Bernie? 
   He had his arm around me. He was leading me to the front. Everyone was watching, and I went along. The next thing I knew, I was leading about 300 people in a tribal dance. Even though I was not born to be a dancer and I certainly didn't know that particular dance, Bernie made it easy. He had such an open, loving, and compassionate nature that you just couldn't help but feel a part of it. As I looked around, people were smiling, and there was a real sense of comradery and respect shared by everyone in the room. About two hours later, as the event was winding down, I said goodbye to Bernie, and I got into my car. 
   As I drove away, I realized what Bernie had really done for me that day. He helped me understand Native American cultures from the inside, not as someone sitting on the sidelines watching, but as someone in the middle of the festivities. I felt the sense of community and respect that Bernie was always so proud of. Anyone can talk about those qualities and traditions, but Bernie let me experience them, and he did it with a big grin on his face. I know I'm better off for that experience. 
   That day shows just how effective Bernie was at getting us to shed our expectations, to realize what we have in common, and to work together. 
   Throughout his life, Bernie used his own unique style and generous heart to accomplish many things. He founded the United Indians of All Tribes Foundation, which provides education and counseling resources for the estimated 25,000 American Indians in the Puget Sound area. Along with the Daybreak Center and the United Indians Foundation, he worked to sensitize Seattle police to urban Indian issues. Recognizing the persistent need for American Indian health services, he also helped create the Seattle Indian Health Board and later served as its first executive director. 
   For his many contributions, Bernie Whitebear was awarded numerous honors. In 1997, Governor Gary Locke named him a ``Citizen of the Decade.'' He recently received Seattle's Distinguished Citizen Medal. In 1998, the University of Washington gave him the Distinguished Alumnus of the Year Award. Bernie was a remarkable man with spirit and a warmth that touched everyone he encountered. My thoughts and sympathies are with all of Bernie's family and friends. 
   Bernie Whitebear acted as a beacon for compassion, cultural understanding and tribal sovereignty in the Puget Sound Region. His legacy is left in all of us who have tremendous respect for the history and cultures of the tribes, a history Bernie would draw us into, by his passion, by his words and by his deeds. I will miss him.

    Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I want to thank Senator REID for requesting a leave of absence for me for the duration of this week. I am traveling home today to attend and speak at tomorrow's memorial service for Mr. Bernie Whitebear, of Seattle, Washington, who passed away at the age of 62 on Sunday, July 16, 2000. 
   Earlier in the week, I did have a statement for the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD about Bernie Whitebear and his many contributions to Washington state. He was a special man to my constituents. He was a special man to me. Bernie helped me understand Native American cultures from the inside as a participant not as someone sitting on the sidelines. On many occasions, Bernie exposed me to the sense of community and respect that he was always so proud of. Washington state will miss this great man and clearly, it is appropriate for me to be with my constituents tomorrow to celebrate Bernie Whitebear. 
   I thank my colleagues for their consideration and courtesies and I will have a longer statement next week to discuss Senate floor votes.

   Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I want to join with my colleagues in expressing my deep sorrow at the loss of our friend and colleague, PAUL COVERDELL. During this difficult time, I want to extend my thoughts and prayers to Nancy and all of his family. 
   PAUL and I both came to Washington, D.C. in January of 1993. In the years that I've know PAUL, I've always been impressed by his thoughtfulness and his work ethic. 
   I always had the upmost respect for him because of his quiet demeanor. He did not seek headlines, and he did not seek credit. Whether it was fighting illegal drugs or working on education or tax policy, he simply did his work with a quiet determination, an open heart,  and a kind word for anyone who crossed his path. 
   My predecessor in the Senate, Warren Magnuson, had a phrase for someone like that-- ``a workhorse not a showhorse.''

   Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I applaud the efforts of the sponsors of this amendment. 
   As a Senator from a border State, I recognize the frustrations that have brought us to this point. 
   American consumers must have access to safe, affordable prescription drugs. 
   Mr. President, I intend to vote for this amendment because I believe we must move this debate forward. 
   I know that many Americans are facing serious problems because of the cost of prescription drugs. 
   I hope this amendment will have some impact on the market forces and that we will see some savings as a result. 
   But, Mr. President, while I will support this amendment, I do have two serious concerns. 
   First, we must be careful that we don't weaken the high safety standards for drugs in this country. 
   And second, we should not think for a moment that passing this amendment will mean we have helped senior citizens get access to the drugs they need. 
   We still must pass a Medicare prescription drug benefit. 
   I'm concerned that this amendment could draw attention away from the much larger issue of providing a prescription drug benefit through Medicare. 
   Mr. President, I've spent a lot of time working on this issue. 
   In fact, back in 1997--as a member of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee--I examined the drug approval process so that we could enact a responsible and balanced FDA reform bill. 
   The one lesson I took away from that process is that, while some of the rules for drug approval in this country can be lengthy, they have been successful in ensuring that America's prescription drugs are safe and effective. 
   We've worked hard to ensure we have safe pharmaceuticals in this country, and I don't know any American who would accept anything less than the safety we have today. 
   Unfortunately, this amendment does not guarantee that those standards will remain as strong as they must be. That's because other countries have lower standards. 
   In fact, a recent hearing in the House Commerce Committee clearly illustrated a number of lapses in safety inspection at facilities outside the United States. 
   I'm concerned that even with ``importation restrictions'' we can't be as confident as we should be of the manufacturing standards used abroad. 
   This amendment gives us no assurance about the conditions under which the products were packaged, stored, handled, or shipped. 
   Consumers have no way to determine the potency of the individual units. 
   We know there are these types of problems with imported drugs today, and I'm concerned that unless this amendment is implemented very carefully, we could magnify those problems. 
   While I am pleased that the sponsors have made significant improvements from the House-passed amendment on drug reimportation, I'm still concerned that implementation could undermine our faith in the safety of all prescription drugs. 
   Mr. President, I'm also concerned that there is no guarantee that consumers would reap the benefits that are being suggested. 
   There is no requirement that the wholesaler or distributor pass the savings on to consumers. 
   Today, each consumer today often pays a different price for a prescription drug depending upon whether or not they have insurance coverage. 
   This amendment could simply enrich drug wholesalers at the expense of consumers. 
   In fact, back in 1999 David Kessler, the former FDA Commissioner, made this point regarding the effect on the consumer when he said:  
   ..... prices to ultimate consumers are generally not lowered. ..... Rather, the profits go to the various middlemen, here and abroad, while consumers bear the risk.  
   Mr. President, the bottom line is that drug re-importation does not guarantee any savings for the consumer. 
   Mr. President, I have heard many of my colleagues talk about the need for a prescription drug benefit for seniors to ensure affordable access to prescription drugs. 
   If any of my colleagues think this amendment will meet this objective, they will be disappointed. 
   This amendment will simply not provide affordable, continuous, comprehensive access to prescription drugs for Medicare beneficiaries. 
   A prescription drug benefit is not just something to be ``tacked-on'' to Medicare. It has to be a fundamental change in how we provide health care to seniors and the disabled. 
   Today, prescription drugs are the doctor's office visits of 20 years ago and that must be considered as we work on adding a prescription drug benefit. 
   Mr. President, I do plan on supporting this amendment with the reservations I've mentioned. 
   I am hopeful that the regulatory process can address some of these risks, and I believe this amendment will--at the least--address some of the issues of fairness that have been raised. 
   I just hope that America's seniors are not fooled by this amendment. 
   No one should claim that--with this amendment--we have addressed the issue of prescription drug costs for seniors. 
   It is still a job we must undertake, and I hope that this amendment strengthens--rather than weakens--the resolve of the Senate to provide a prescription drug benefit through Medicare.

   Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, our Nation is blessed with many natural treasures that hold unique scientific or cultural value. 
   That's why in 1906 the Congress passed and the President signed the Antiquities Act to give us a way to protect these unique lands. 
   Since 1906, presidents of all parties have used the act to designate over 100 national monuments--including several which Congress later designated as National Parks including the Grand Canyon, Grand Teton and Olympic National Parks. 
   Each year, more than 50 million visitors enjoy our country's national monuments. Today, there are other unique areas throughout our country that hold similar value. Unfortunately, some of these remarkable areas are threatened by growth, development, and harvesting. 
   I believe we have a responsibility to protect these natural treasures. I believe we have a responsibility to be a good steward of these lands and to pass them on--untarnished--to future generations 
   I'm proud that Washington state is home to the Hanford Reach--which is the last-free flowing stretch of the Columbia River. During World War II and the Cold War, the people of the Tri-Cities made sacrifices that helped our nation end World War II and win the Cold War. Because of the high security around the nuclear facility, for decades this part of the Columbia River and the surrounding land was protected from development. Unfortunately, its future was not certain. 
   The Hanford Reach is a key salmon spawning ground and as many of my colleagues know we are working in the Pacific Northwest to help recover our once-abundant salmon stocks. I was pleased that the President used his authority--under the Antiquities Act--to designate the Hanford Reach as a National Monument. 
   Mr. President, it was the right thing to do. 
   That designation will help us recover salmon stocks, will ensure families can continue to enjoy the Reach, and will share the history of the Tri-Cities with the American public. And of course, the designation will preserve a unique habitat for future generations. 
   I hope that in the future, the Hanford Reach National Monument receives the attention and recognition that it deserves. The Olympic National Park began as a National Monument--one of the first--designated by President Roosevelt in 1909. Many generations of Americans have enjoyed the natural splendor that the Olympics and the surrounding area offer. I hope that the Hanford Reach will also become a destination for Americans eager to learn more about our past. 
   Unfortunately, the Nickles' amendment would deny the possibility of such protection to other deserving areas around the country. It is clear that supporters of this amendment are unhappy with the President's use of the Antiquities Act. But in the end, the President has legally exercised the authority vested in him by the Act. 
   If this Congress is really unhappy with the Antiquities Act, it could amend the Act itself or override particular designations. But we all know that won't happen. The reason it won't happen is because the majority of Americans believe that the lands protected under the Antiquities Act are deserving of such protection. 
   The Grand Canyon, Devils Tower, Mt. Olympus, Jackson Hole, Death Valley, Joshua Tree--have all been named as national monuments. Few would argue these areas are not worthy of such recognition and protection. The fact is many of these designations have been so popular that Congress later designated them as national parks, often expanding them at the same time. Again, Olympic National Park in my home state is an example of such Congressional action. 
   In 1906, Congress had the wisdom to grant the President the power to protect important natural and historic areas of our country. The need for such power is not at an end. Threats of development and impacts from other activities will continue and in some cases will lead to the recognition that greater protection for certain federal lands is warranted. At that time, the President, who ever she or he may be, should have the ability to act as every President has since 1906. Indeed, since the Antiquities Act was passed 14 of the 17 Presidents have used its powers. 
   If it is indeed the will of Congress to limit this historic power of the Presidency, then let us do so after a full and public legislative process. This amendment is simply a back-door attempt to accomplish what the sponsor and supporters know they cannot do through a stand alone bill. 
   Despite some controversy, the President's designations have had the support of members of Congress and the public. In fact, I--along with many members of my state's delegation in the House--supported the President's recent designation of the Hanford Reach as a national monument. This designation was also supported by many people in the Tri-Cities and across the state. 
   Before I close I remind my colleagues that a similar amendment was included in the House Interior bill as it was reported by the Committee. Fortunately, thanks to the leadership of Congressman DICKS and Congressman BOEHLERT, that amendment was removed from the House bill. However, before the amendment's removal, the House bill received a veto threat because of this provision. We can certainly expect a similar veto threat from the Administration if this amendment is adopted. 
   For the first time in years, we have the opportunity to pass a free standing Interior Appropriations bill into law. This amendment would seriously compromise that possibility. 
   We should stand up for the people and communities who are eager to share in the benefits of these national monuments. 
   Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to reject this amendment.

   Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise today to speak briefly about the estate tax repeal bill before the Senate. 
   Along with eight of my Democratic colleagues, I am a cosponsor of S. 1128, the Kyl-Kerrey repeal bill. Barring the attachment of any egregious amendments, I intend to vote for final passage of H.R. 8. 
   But while I am a cosponsor of S. 1128, I want to take a moment to voice my concern about the debate we have had so far. 
   I believe there are two policy challenges before us. 
   First, Congress needs to ensure the vast majority of Americans--including those who do not own family business and farm assets--do not need to worry about paying estate taxes or going through burdensome estate tax planning. Current law does a fairly good job in this area. In fact, only two percent of estates actually pay an estate tax each year. 
   The estate tax reform provisions we passed as part of the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 helped take us further in the right direction. But the prosperity we've had in the last seven years has threatened to push more people in the direction of costly estate tax planning. In the spirit of a fairer tax code, Congress needs to take additional action. 
   The second policy challenge we face is more complex. That challenge is to ensure the tax code does not prevent the efficient transfer of family businesses and farms to the next generation. Unfortunately, in its current form, the estate tax can be a major hurdle to the efficient transfer of family business and farm assets. 
   One of the arguments made for the estate tax is it deconcentrates wealth. The problem is family businesses--sometimes as the result of planning for the estate tax or paying the estate tax--have been swept up by large corporations with no ties to the community. We need to recognize changes in the economy have also changed the debate we should be having on the estate tax. 
   I am a cosponsor of S. 1128 because I believe it is the only reasonable vehicle before us that addresses how we transfer family businesses and farms to the next generation. Unfortunately, estate tax repeal is extremely expensive. And at the end of the day, I am still hopeful we can find another solution to the two policy challenges I have outlined. 
   While I will vote to pass H.R. 8, I must express some disappointment with the estate tax debate we've had in Congress. It's as if both sides have dug in so deep with the same arguments for so long that we can't have a thoughtful debate on the merits of the issue. The black and white choice is either to repeal the ``death'' tax or to oppose a tax break that will only benefit America's wealthiest citizens. 
   My friends in the majority could be proposing estate tax reform or repeal in the context of a responsible, long-term fiscal plan. Unfortunately, they have chosen not to do so. It seems the extent of the fiscal planning our majority colleagues have done is to note there were 279 votes in the House for H.R. 8--enough to override an expected veto. I believe the American people deserve more thoughtful deliberation. 
   Meanwhile, many Democrats and the Administration have been slower to react to real and heartfelt concerns people have about the estate tax. H.R. 8 has been criticized by some of my colleagues as a bill that would simply benefit the wealthiest estates. I can tell you that I have not been contacted by the wealthiest individuals in my state. Rather, for the last seven years, I have heard from family business and farm owners who are desperate to get a tax code that effectively allows them to transfer their operations to the children and grandchildren. They want their Washington state businesses to remain Washington state businesses for many years to come. 
   Since I first began working on estate tax reform in 1995, my commitment has been to provide estate tax relief to small family businesses and farmers. I believe the public interest on this issue is to continue to work--as I have done the last five years--to push forward with estate tax reform. Therefore, I supported the Democratic alternative and I will support H.R. 8. It is my sincere hope we can work on a bipartisan basis to craft a compromise that President Clinton will sign before the end of the year. And I hope the compromise will include estate tax relief for small businesses and farms in the next ten years, which H.R. 8 does not do. 
   It is clear H.R. 8 will be vetoed, and likely Congress will sustain the veto. But I'm glad we had the debate. Earlier this week, when we appeared deadlocked on the estate tax bill, I initiated a letter signed by all nine of the Democratic cosponsors of S. 1128. The letter urged the majority leader to allow a reasonable number of Democratic amendments on the estate tax bill. 
   Following my letter, I was pleased we were able to move forward with a unanimous consent agreement to consider the estate tax bill. After this debate, I hope we can move forward to consider the other pressing business before us, including passage of permanent normal trade relations for China.

   Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, the Labor, Health and Human Services appropriations bill is meant to address the needs of our nation's most precious resource, our people. When a Labor, HHS bill is properly funded, it ensures the health of our families, the education of our children and the safety of our workers. Unfortunately, the bill before us falls short and I will vote against it. 
   In March, I expressed my concerns that the Congressional Majority was not sufficiently funding this part of the budget. 
   Today, in June, we can see specifically how those shortcomings will impact the American people. While this bill does make some specific gains in key public health programs, the overall picture is lacking. 
   While I am pleased with some parts of this bill, I am voting against it because it does not make the necessary commitments to public health, worker safety, and reducing class sizes. We have a surplus and we can invest in key programs like education, health care, job training, and work place, but instead we are guided by a spending plan that places a greater emphasis on irresponsible tax cuts. 
   Before I outline the specific reasons for my vote, I do want to thank the Chairman for his hard work on this bill. He has been given an impossible task, and he has still been able to make some key investments in vital health initiatives like the National Institutes of Health, NIH, our efforts to reduce medical mistakes, and efforts to expand medical services in rural areas through the use of telemedicine. 
   When it comes to funding the NIH, the additional $2.7 billion allocated in this bill is clearly a sound and wise investment. Unfortunately, we have not made the same investment in other important health care access and prevention programs, but I am committed to working with the Chairman to maintain this level for NIH. 
   We also need to ensure that all public health agencies receive the same level of commitment and support. Without the work and programs of CDC, HRSA, and FDA, research funded from NIH will never make it to patients. 
   We also need to show the same commitment to prevention programs and health care access programs that we have shown to NIH. What we sometimes forget is the number one killer in this country is cardiovascular disease, a disease that we can do more to prevent. 
   Another highlight of this bill is its support for innovative solutions to prevent medical errors. The $50 million to fund new projects to reduce medical mistakes is essential if we hope to implement effective, constructive solutions. I believe this new funding will provide support to hospitals and clinics to automate drug dispensing to reduce fatal errors from prescription drugs not administered correctly. It will ensure that we utilize ``best practice'' standards when implementing automation into hospitals and will allow the expansion of current efforts at the Veterans Administration to reduce medical mistakes. The Institute of Medicine's report on medical errors clearly illustrated what was wrong in our health care delivery system. Fortunately, this Appropriations bill provides the funding to help us avoid medical 
   mistakes. 
   I also want to thank the Chairman for his support of telemedicine efforts. For rural communities in Washington state, expanding and enhancing telemedicine is an important part of ensuring access to quality, affordable health care. I appreciate the Chairman's support of my request for Children's Hospital in Seattle to support a telemedicine project. 
   I would be remiss if I did not congratulate the Chairman and Ranking member for their efforts on behalf of women's health care. The pending LHHS Appropriations bill does address many of the gender inequities in research and access. The Chairman has also provided an increase for the CDC Breast and Cervical Cancer Treatment Act to expand the Wise Women program to additional states, including Washington state. This important screening program would allow for the screening of breast and cervical cancer as well as heart disease. It builds on the success of the breast and cervical cancer screening program to offer greater access for low income women. 
   Clearly, there are some good elements of this bill. Unfortunately, the lack of overall investment in public health undermines these provisions. The bottom line is that the overall commitment made to the LHHS and Education programs has been short changed in order to provide massive tax cuts for the few. The priorities of  the FY01 Budget Resolution simply do not reflect the priorities of working families. 
   Another problem with this bill is it does not protect America's workers. Today, we have one of the lowest unemployment rates in our nation's post-war economy. We have jobs that cannot be filled, but we also have workers who cannot find jobs because they lack the training and necessary skills. Dislocated workers are a resource we simply have not tapped and the funding levels in this bill do not allow for the necessary investment in these programs. 
   This bill also does not allow OSHA to issue an ergonomics standard, even though ergonomic injuries are the single-largest occupational health crisis faced by men and women in our work force today. 
   I am also disappointed that this bill does not fund the President's efforts to ensure pay equity. This bill does not give the Department of Labor and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission the tools it needs to enforce wage discrimination rules. 
   In addition, this bill does not guarantee that classrooms across America will be less crowded next year. While I appreciate the Chairman's efforts, the funding level is not adequate to meet our goal of hiring 100,000 new teachers to reduce classroom overcrowding. In addition, the structure of the funding does not guarantee that the funds will be used to reduce classroom overcrowding. 
   This is a national priority, and we should direct this investment to reducing class size. If we do not continue to honor our commitment to classroom overcrowding, we will have failed to give students the tools to learn the basics in disciplined environment. 
   I also am concerned that we have doomed this bill to failure if we reject the President's education agenda, which includes a targeted class size reduction program. Not simply throwing more money at the problem, but using limited resources to invest in our children. I will continue to work with the Chairman as I do believe he is trying to work with difficult spending limitations, but we need to improve our commitment to reducing class sizes. This bill does not get the job done. 
   Finally, Mr. President, I want to express my strong opposition to the Helms Amendment, which would override the choices of thousands of communities and would endanger America's students. 
   Currently, 23 states allow minors access to confidential family planning and contraceptives. The Helms amendment would override those laws and--in effect--create a new federal parental consent law. Access to safe, confidential reproductive health care services for minors is a major health concern, and various communities have found their own ways to address it. 
   This is not just about preventing pregnancy. It's about preventing fatalities. AIDS and HIV threaten students today. Unfortunately, this amendment jeopardizes a public health effort to protect these students. 
   I do want to mention that I was surprised to hear the sponsor of this amendment talk about access to RU-486 in school-based clinics. I would remind my colleague that RU-486 has still not been approved for use in this country. The real issue here is our ability to protect the health of students across America, and the Helms amendment stands in the way of that important priority. 
   When I look at the Labor, HHS bill, I see a bill that fails America's workers and students. Because this bill does not make the necessary investments in public health, worker safety and education, I am voting against it.

   Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I am pleased and relieved that after weeks of uncertainty we have finally reached this point, and that we are ready to act on the Military Construction Bill. 
   As always, I thank Senator BURNS, the Chairman of the Military Construction Subcommittee for his leadership and bipartisan cooperation. I also want to thank Chairman STEVENS and Senator BYRD for their work in producing this bill. They set an excellent example for all of us to follow. 
   The FY 2001 Military Construction Appropriations Bill provides $8.8 billion dollars in spending. This agreement also represents a tremendous amount of work and a great deal of cooperation between the House and Senate. 
   We went into conference with very different recommendations for projects, and simply not enough money to go around. We came out with a bipartisan package that is fair and balanced and, most importantly, addresses some of our most pressing military construction needs. I wish we could have done more because the needs are so significant. 
   As our nation continues to tally up ever-larger budget surpluses, I hope that the Defense Department will channel more resources into military construction. We simply cannot continue to balance the best military in the world on the back of a crumbling infrastructure. We ask tremendous sacrifices from our military families, and this bill is an opportunity to address their pressing needs. 
   Mr. President, I would also like to acknowledge the excellent contributions of the Military Construction Subcommittee staff for their many hours of hard work in crafting this agreement. 
   I also want to make a few brief comments regarding the supplemental appropriations that have been attached to this legislation. I will vote for the conference report but I do so with serious reservations about numerous provisions in the supplemental. It is important to note that the package before the Senate today does not represent the work of the entire conference committee. The conference committee did not meet to consider the supplemental items. 
   This has not been an ideal process. While this bill provides funding for needed projects and disaster relief, many needs were left unaddressed. Other projects were added that were not part of either the President's supplemental request or the Senate's supplemental provisions. 
   I am particularly disappointed that this conference report does not include the Senate's language to provide Seattle and other local governments in Washington state with the needed reimbursement funding for last year's WTO meeting. The federal government has not been a true partner is sharing the costs for this event. 
   I am particularly disappointed with the Congressional Majority, which promised to include this language. Unfortunately, when they met behind closed doors, they chose to neglect our obligation to Seattle. I will demand that the Senate act on this matter before we adjourn this year. 
   In addition, I continue to have serious reservations about the assistance package to Columbia for counter narcotics activities. I have worked with Senator LEAHY to strengthen the human rights provisions within the bill, and I did vote for both amendments to limit funding to Columbia during the Senate's consideration of the issue. If the Columbia funding were attached to a bill other than Military Construction where I serve as ranking member, I would give serious consideration to voting against the bill. 
   I also want to note for my colleagues that this legislation provides significant disaster assistance for New Mexico to aid the Los Alamos area in dealing with the recent devastating fire. Senator DOMENICI and Senator BINGAMAN have been very diligent in working with the Senate on this issue. 
   At this moment, fire crews in Washington state have finally gotten control of another significant fire near one of our country's nuclear weapons facilities. More than 200,000 acres were destroyed by a fast-moving fire on and around the Hanford Nuclear Reservation. 
   Secretary Richardson is at Hanford today to assess the damage. I have been in contact with Governor Gary Locke and various federal officials to follow the fire developments. While it is too soon to know the extent of the damage, I do want my colleagues to be aware of this serious situation.

   Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the Daschle amendment to prohibit genetic discrimination in employment. I commend the Senator for his leadership in this area, and I thank him for bringing this amendment to the floor. 
   The issue of genetic discrimination is a timely debate in light of the recent announcement that science has conquered the genetic code. This is a major milestone that brings us closer to finding cure for cancer, heart disease, diabetes, Parkinsons, M.S., and a whole host of other tragic diseases. 
   The science is moving ahead rapidly, and our standards for the use of that science must not lag behind. We must ensure that genetic information is not used in discriminatory ways. If we do not take a stand prohibiting discrimination based on one's genetic make up, we could jeopardize the benefits offered by science. We must ensure that our genetic finger print is used only for good, and not as a tool to discriminate. 
   I've talked to many women in my state who are concerned about breast cancer. They know they should undergo genetic testing to find out if they are predisposed to breast cancer, but they don't. They avoid getting tested because they are afraid that the results could be used against them and could adversely affect their employment or insurance coverage. 
   They are concerned that if they use the science, it will be used against them. Enacting a tough federal ban on genetic discrimination will give these women, along with thousands of other people across the country, the peace of mind that they can take advantage of the latest tools of medicine without being taken advantage of in the process. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this amendment now. We have made a significant investment in genetic research. Let's make sure that we all benefit from this investment. If we act now, we will ensure this information is used to treat patients and not to penalize them.

   Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I come to the floor this afternoon to argue, again, that no child should have to struggle for a teacher's attention in an overcrowded classroom. Every child deserves a classroom environment where they can learn and grow and get individual attention from a caring, qualified teacher. With the amendment I am offering this afternoon, we have an opportunity, again, to make that happen. 
   I am proud to report that classrooms across America are less crowded this year than they were last year. In fact, this year, 1.7 million children benefited from less crowded classrooms. The reason those students are learning in smaller classes is because this Congress made a commitment to help local school districts hire 100,000 new fully qualified teachers. We are now about one-third of the way towards reaching that goal. 
   By all measures, this has been a very successful program. Given the progress we have made, many parents and teachers would have a hard time believing that this Congress is about to abandon its commitment to reduce class size, but that is exactly what the bill before us would do. It would abandon our commitment to helping school districts reduce classroom overcrowding. 
   This bill would take the promise of smaller classes and yank it away from students and parents and teachers. This underlying bill does not guarantee funding for the Class Size Reduction Program as it is currently written. If it is passed without the amendment I am offering, school districts across the country cannot rely on having the money available to hire new teachers or to pay the salaries of the teachers they have already hired. 
   I have talked to hundreds of local educators, parents, and 
   students. To them, that is unacceptable. That is why I have come to the floor today to offer my amendment that would continue our commitment to reducing class sizes. 
   Under this successful program, we have hired 29,000 new teachers, and we have given 1.7 million students across the country less crowded classrooms. Clearly, we are making progress, but we can't be satisfied with the status quo. We need to bring the benefits of smaller classes to more students. It is clear that smaller classes help students learn the basics with fewer discipline problems. Parents know it. Teachers know it. Students know it. 
   On the chart behind me, I have listed some of the benefits of smaller classes. They include better student achievement, something every Senator has come to the floor to speak for; fewer discipline problems, something about which we hear constantly; more individual attention; better parent-teacher communication; dramatic results for poor and minority students. 
   As a former educator, I can tell the Senate, there is a difference between having 35 kids in your classroom and having 18 kids in your classroom. With 35 kids, you spend most of your time on crowd control. With 18 kids, you spend most of your time teaching. But it is not only my experience. National research proves that smaller class sizes help students learn the basics they need in a disciplined environment. 
   A study that was conducted in Tennessee in 1989, which is known as the STAR study, compared the performance of students in grades K through 3 in small and regular size classes. That study found that students in small classes, those with 13 to 17 students, significantly outperformed other students in math and in reading. The STAR study found that students benefited from smaller classes at all grade levels and across all geographic areas. The study found that students in small classes have better high school graduation rates. These were kids who were in smaller classes in kindergarten through the third grade. They found, as they followed them through later on, they had better high school graduation rates, higher grade point averages, and were more inclined to pursue higher education. Certainly these are goals this Senate should be proud of helping to achieve. 
   According to the research conducted by Princeton University economist, Dr. Alan Kruger, students who attended small classes were more likely to take ACT or SAT college entrance exams. That was particularly true for African Americans students. According to Dr. Kruger:  
   Attendance in small classes appears to have cut the black-white gap in the probability of taking a college-entrance exam by more than half.  
   Three other researchers at two different institutions of higher education found that STAR students who attended small classes in the early K through 3 grades were between 6 and 13 months ahead of their regular class peers in math, reading, and science in  each of grades four, six, and eight, as they followed them through. 
   In yet another part of the country, a different class size reduction study reached similar conclusions. The Wisconsin SAGE study, Student Achievement Guarantee in Education, findings from 1996 through 1999 consistently proved that smaller classes result in significantly greater student achievement. 
   Class size reduction programs in the State study resulted in increased attention to individual students. It produced three main benefits: Fewer discipline problems and more instruction; more knowledge of students; and more teacher enthusiasm for teaching. 
   The Wisconsin study also found in smaller classes teachers were able to identify the learning problems of individual students more quickly. As one teacher participant in the State class size reduction study said, ``If a child is having problems, you can see it right away. You can take care of it right then. It works a lot better for children.'' 
   The data is conclusive. Smaller classes help kids learn the basics in a disciplined environment. I am also proud that the class size program is simple and efficient. The school districts simply fill out a one-page form, which happens to be available online. Then the Department of Education sends them money to hire new teachers based on need and enrollment. The teachers have told me they have never seen money move so quickly from Congress to the classroom as under our class size bill. 
   Linda McGeachy in the Vancouver school district in my State commented, ``The language is very clear, applying was very easy, and their funds really work to support classroom teachers.'' 
   The class size program is also flexible. Any school district that has already reduced class sizes in the early grades to 18 or fewer children may use the funds to further reduce class sizes in the other early grades. They can use it to reduce class sizes in kindergarten or they can carry out activities to improve teacher quality, including professional development. 
   I am sure some Members are going to argue that schools could still hire teachers if they wanted to by using the title VI funding in this underlying bill. Now, that may sound good at first, but it doesn't recognize the reality of how school boards work. The language in the underlying bill won't work. Mr. President, I served on a local school board. Finding the money to hire and train new teachers requires a financial commitment over many years in the face of many competing priorities. That is one of the reasons why school districts have so much trouble reducing class size without our Federal partnership. 
   Last year, we told school districts we would give them the money to hire teachers for 7 years. They heard our commitment and they hired more than 29,000 new teachers. Unfortunately, today, this underlying bill asks school districts to choose whether or not to keep those teachers, without any assurance that the money will still be there in the coming years. 
   I can tell you, if I were still on a school board, I would find it very difficult to keep those teachers, not knowing if I would have the money for them in the future. That is why we need to protect that money and guarantee that it goes to reduce class sizes. Because this bill abandons our commitment as a Federal partner, it leaves school districts with a false choice, and it means our kids are going to lose out. We should keep our commitment to reducing class size. 
   There is another reason why my amendment is so necessary, another critical reason why using the general title VI funding is not an adequate substitute. I have discussed this, as my colleagues know, many times on the floor of the Senate--why programs that are put into block grants with no specific purpose, such as title VI, are much less effective in targeting resources to our neediest students. Under the class size program, money is targeted to those needy students. For example, from the State level, funds are targeted 80 percent based on poverty and 20 percent based on student population. The program is designed to make sure economically disadvantaged students who benefit the most get smaller classes. We know poor and minority students can make dramatic gains in less crowded classrooms. And this amendment targets new teachers directly to those vulnerable students. Without my amendment, however, there is no guarantee those poor students will get the support they need. 
   Let me be clear. A block grant that is not targeted toward a specific educational purpose fails to ensure that our most vulnerable students get the resources they need. We need to pass this amendment so we can guarantee those students can benefit from smaller class sizes. 
   Before I close, I want to make one final point. We are going to continue this program sooner or later. The President has made it clear that he will veto this bill unless it funds the Class Size Reduction Program. His track record on this is pretty clear. He has stood up for the class size program time and again in the past. So the real question is, Are we going to vote to fund the program now, in June, or are we going to wait until the end of the fiscal year, sometime in October, when the clock is running and the congressional majority has to negotiate again with the President? 
   We should do it now. We should pass this amendment now, early in the process, so that school boards across America will have a clear indication that money for their new teachers will be there. 
   In closing, this amendment gives my colleagues the opportunity to support one of the most successful efforts we have ever seen in our schools in years. This amendment gives us a chance to fix the underlying Labor-HHS bill so that our students are not trapped in overcrowded classrooms. Let's invest in the things we know work. Let's support local school districts as they work to hire new teachers, and lets keep our commitment to America's schoolchildren so that they can learn the basics in a disciplined environment. 
   This is an issue we have worked on for some time, and the underlying bill will not keep our commitment to class size that is so important, that so many parents, students and teachers are waiting for us to make. That is why this amendment is so important. 
   I see that my colleague from Massachusetts is here.

   Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, the Senator from Massachusetts is absolutely correct. There is a role for local school districts. There is a role for States, and there is a role for Federal Government, however small it is, in this country in terms of education. 
   The public has told us overwhelmingly time and time again they want the Federal role to remain. The Federal role, historically, has been to make sure the most needy and disadvantaged students in the country, wherever they are, are not left behind. 
   In the class size amendment, we target the funds directly to those kids because they need it the most and they are helped the most by it. The underlying bill, which I am amending, as the  Senator from Massachusetts stated, block grants the money to title VI funds and therefore is block granted to all students, and it is not what the Federal role has been or should continue to be. So the Senator from Massachusetts is absolutely correct that this amendment is important.

   Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, the Senator from Massachusetts is correct. There have been a number of studies that have followed class size reduction--from the Tennessee study in 1985 and 1990; the STAR study in 1996-1997; the SAGE Program that the Senator from Massachusetts mentioned in 1998-1999; the educational testing service study in 1997; New York City school study in April 2000; the Council for Greater City Schools in October of 1990. 
   All of these studies have followed up on what we have been able to do in reducing class size and have shown the same benefits of better student achievement, fewer discipline problems, and better test scores for students as they moved into the upper grades. 
   It is astounding to me that we had a bipartisan agreement 2 years ago to begin to reduce class size and every year, it seems, we have to come back and argue this again, debate it again, move on to a vote, then get to a point in October where we again amend the budget, and finally put it in the budget. 
   It seems to me, and I assume to the Senator from Massachusetts, that we would be smarter to put it in the bill now so school districts that are trying to figure out what we are doing will have the knowledge that this program will continue; that they can begin to hire their teachers, as they do in the months of June and July, and be ready to move on without the question of being 
   left out there.

   Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I respond to the Senator from Massachusetts by reminding my colleagues that I formerly served on a school board. I can tell you what you do in the months of June and July. You hire teachers and renew contracts. School districts out there that have used the Federal dollars that we have provided them for the last 2 years have hired those teachers and they now have to make a commitment to continue. 
   For example, the Takoma School District in my home State of Washington used the class size dollars to reduce class sizes of 58 first grade classrooms. In that school district, they now have 15 students in those classrooms. It has made a tremendous difference. But they have hired these additional teachers, and they are now looking at the underlying bill that we have which says to them that this is now going to be a block grant with no guarantee that this money will go to the most needy 80 percent of the schools. Under the block grant program, they are going to lose some of the money in their districts for these teachers. They, therefore, right now can't make a commitment to these teachers that they will be able to hire them again in September. 
   This sends a very bad message to local school boards across the country that have hired teachers. And school boards are not going to be able to make the commitment that they need to make. That is why this amendment is so important. It will send a message today--right now, almost at the end of June--that they can make a commitment to those teachers. 
   Being a teacher right now is extremely difficult, as the Senator from Massachusetts well knows. Most teachers aren't paid well. They have trouble staying in schools because of the many challenges that are there already with this kind of uncertainty: Well, we might be able to hire you. You have to wait and see what Congress does in a couple of months because they haven't given us a commitment. We are not sure you are going to be able to go back. If I were a teacher in those circumstances, I would be out finding another job immediately. These teachers have to put food on the table, pay their rent, and they have all the expenses  the rest of us have. They can't live in an uncertain job market such as this. 
   We have a responsibility to tell them the truth and to tell them what we are doing. By passing the underlying amendment today, we will send a message to those school boards that they can give a commitment to those teachers, and those teachers will know where they will be in September. Without passage of this amendment, I guarantee you that we are going to be in a budget debate in October where we are going to be having the President say he will veto the budget without this. And we will be making a decision in October that we could very easily and simply make today. 
   That is why this amendment is so important.

   Mrs. MURRAY. First of all, our students, because they won't have the opportunity to be in a small class to which we committed. 
   I know parents today with kids in kindergarten who maybe had an older child in first or second grade, because of reduced class sizes, have called, saying: Please, my second child is on the way. For my first child, it has made such a difference in their life, being in a smaller class size. Make sure my second child coming behind them has the same opportunity. 
   That is what we are talking about today. So kids in these classrooms can read, learn, write, have an adult who has the time to pay attention to them. That is what this amendment guarantees to students in this country. 
   I have taught before. I know what it is to have too many kids in your classroom, especially in today's overcrowded classrooms across this country. Kids come with all kinds of problems that many professionals did not experience when we were in classrooms many years ago. In my classroom, I had an experience sitting with 24 4-year-old kids talking about the ABCs. When I called on one child, he looked directly at me and said: My dad did not come home last night; the police arrested him. 
   I didn't have the time to stop and deal with a child who certainly was in a traumatic situation because I was going to lose the attention and the ability to discipline 23 other kids immediately. 
   With a class size of 15, and a child coming to the classroom with traumatic problems, the teacher will have the time to sit down and deal with that child. 
   I wonder what happened to that 4-year-old. That was several years ago. I wonder what happened to him. If I had the time to deal with him, he would probably be doing better today. 
   We have a responsibility, for so many reasons, to continue this funding. The most important reason is because of the kids.

I, too, am surprised our Republican colleagues, who took full credit for this several years ago when we began it, sending out press releases touting it, don't understand this issue is still as powerful. 
   I have talked to many of my colleagues who have gone home to their States and visited classrooms where Federal dollars were used to reduce class size. The accolades received from the kids, the parents, the teachers, the people who work with the kids are tremendous. 
   I offer to my colleagues on the other side, who have consistently voted against this, if Members want to have a good experience, vote for this amendment, go home to a classroom and talk to the kids, the parents, and the teachers who have been directly impacted. You will see some of the good that comes from voting on an amendment such as this.

   Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, the amendment we are now going to vote on simply continues our commitment to reduce class sizes for the first through the third grades across this country. Because of the work we have done in the past day, 1.7 million children are in smaller class sizes. 
   We have a commitment. We should keep our commitment to continue to reduce class size. The underlying bill simply block grants the money. That will hurt our neediest and most disadvantaged students who will lose under that kind of proposal. 
   School boards are meeting today to determine who they will keep as teachers and whether they will be able to make a commitment in the hiring of teachers. 
   We should make this decision now so those school boards can make the decisions for the coming school year rather than once again negotiating this in October when the President has said he will veto a bill that does not keep the commitment to reduce class size. 
   I urge my colleagues to vote for this amendment today and prevent school boards across the country from having to wonder all summer long if we are going to keep our commitment.

   Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I strongly oppose this amendment. 
   We should be reducing the hazards that America's workers face--not putting roadblocks in the way of increased worker safety. 
   Ergonomic injuries are the single-largest occupational health crisis faced by men and women in our work force today. 
   We should let OSHA--the Occupational Safety and Health Administration--issue an ergonomics standard. 
   Ergonomic injuries hurt America's workers and America's productivity. 
   Each year, more than 600,000 private sector workers in America are forced to miss time from work because of painful musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs). 
   These injuries also hurt America's companies because these disorders can cause workers to miss three full weeks of work or more. 
   Employers pay more than $20 billion annually in workers' compensation benefits due to MSDs and up to $60 billion in lost productivity, disability benefits and other associated costs. 
   The impact of MSDs on women workers is especially serious. 
   While women make up 46% of the total workforce and only make up 33% of total injured workers, they receive 63% of all lost work time from ergonomic injuries and 69% of lost work time because of carpal tunnel syndrome. 
   In addition, women in the health care, retail and textile industries are particularly hard hit by MSDs and carpal tunnel syndrome. 
   Women suffer more than 90% of the MSDs among nurses, nurse aides, health care aides and sewing machine operators. 
   Women also account for 91% of the carpal tunnel cases that occur among cashiers. 
   Despite the overwhelming financial and physical impact of MSDs and the disproportionate impact they have on our nation's women, there have been several efforts over the years to prevent OSHA from issuing an ergonomics standard. 
   This amendment is intended to stop OSHA from implementing its ergonomic standard, which is scheduled to take place by the end of this year. We have examined the merits of this rule over and over again. 
   Contrary to what those on the other side of this issue say, the science and data support the need for an ergonomics standard. 
   We shouldn't be placing roadblocks in the way of its implementation. 
   The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) studied ergonomics and concluded that  there is ``clear and compelling evidence'' that MSDs are caused by work and can be reduced and prevented through workplace interventions. 
   The American College of Occupational and Environmental Medicine, the world's largest occupational medical society, agreed with NIOSH and saw no reason to delay implementation. The studies and science are conclusive. 
   Mr. President, the states are getting this right. 
   My state--the state of Washington--just one month ago became the second state along with California to adopt an ergonomics rule. 
   The rule will help employers in my state reduce workplace hazards that cripple and injure more than 50,000 Washington workers a year at a cost of more than $411 million a year. 
   The estimated benefits to employers from reducing these hazards are $340 million per year, with the estimated costs of compliance of only $80.4 million per year. 
   Now Washington and California both have ergonomic standards. North Carolina proposed an ergonomics standard and I understand that other states are also looking into the possibility of developing their own standards to benefit their workers. 
   We should take the cue from my state and others who have seen the wisdom of issuing ergonomics standards. 
   We cannot afford to delay an important standard which will greatly improve workplace safety. 
   Outside of ergonomics, I want to make one general statement about another provision of the underlying bill. 
   The Senate bill underfunds the Dislocated Worker programs by some $181 million dollars, and it underfunds vital re-employment services by $25 million. 
   This will mean that 100,000 dislocated workers will be denied training, job search and re-employment services. 
   In addition, the cuts in re-employment services would effectively deny 111,000 people seeking unemployment insurance from getting other vital re-employment services. 
   Last year these programs were very helpful to workers in my state who were laid off through no cause of their own. 
   For example, the Boeing company, the largest employer in my state, has been especially hard-hit by the trade consequences of overseas competition from Airbus. Thousands of workers have been laid off in the past few years. 
   Those workers who were laid off have been receiving benefits from these programs, and I think it's irresponsible to abandon these workers who were laid off through no fault of their own. We owe it to the workers of America to fully-fund those programs that benefit them and their families. 
   I urge my colleagues to correct this funding problem so these workers aren't left behind. 
   In closing, I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment. 
   We should allow OSHA to issue an ergonomics standard. 
   It will be an important step forward in protecting our nation's workers from crippling injuries.

   Mrs. MURRAY. I thank the Chair. 
   Mr. President, today we are offering the Murray-Snowe amendment. It is an amendment which would lift restrictions on privately funded abortions at military facilities overseas. 
   This is the identical amendment we have offered every year since 1995, and I assure my colleagues that we will continue to offer this amendment until we restore this important health care protection for our women who are serving abroad. 
   It is simply outrageous that today we deny military personnel and their dependents access to safe, affordable, and legal reproductive health care services. We ask these women to serve their country and defend our Government, but we deny them basic rights that are afforded all women in this country. 
   I come to the floor year after year during this DOD authorization in an effort to educate my colleagues in the hope of convincing a majority of them to stand up for all military personnel. I also offer this amendment to highlight the record of those who do stand up for women and their right to a safe and legal abortion at their own cost. 
   To be clear, this is not about Federal funding of abortion. Many of our military personnel serve in hostile areas or in countries that do not provide safe and legal abortion services. Military personnel and their families who serve us overseas should not be forced to seek back alley abortions or abortions in facilities that do not meet the same clinical standards we expect and demand in this country. Sadly, that is exactly the case today. 
   Protecting all military personnel and their dependents has always been a priority of the Department of Defense, which is 
   why the Secretary of Defense supports the amendment Senator SNOWE and I are offering today. This  amendment is also supported by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists because they recognize the danger that these women face outside this country. 
   Some Members will undoubtedly argue that women are afforded access to a legal and safe abortion with the current restriction in place. They will point out that under the current policy, a woman who needs an abortion can request transportation back to the United States for treatment. It is true that she can request a temporary leave from her commanding officer and will be transported at the expense of our military to a location where she would have access to an abortion. To me, that is unacceptable. It forces a woman to provide detailed medical evidence and records to her superior officer with no guarantee or protection that this information will be kept confidential. Then once she gets the commanding officer's permission, she needs to find transportation home, often on a military plane, such as a C-17. 
   I don't know of any other medical procedure that requires a soldier to have to endure such public scrutiny. If there are Members who believe that these women are protected and have access to a basic right that is guaranteed by our Constitution to a safe and legal abortion, I will tell my colleagues this is not the case. Do not be fooled. The current ban on privately funded abortions at military facilities overseas places the women who serve our country in great danger. 
   This amendment is not about Federal funding of abortions. This amendment does not require direct Federal procurement for abortion services. This amendment would, in fact, require the woman, not the taxpayer, to pay the cost of her care at a military facility. This amendment would simply allow the woman to use existing facilities that are currently operational to provide health care to our active duty personnel and their families. 
   This amendment does not call for providing any additional services. It is simply services that are already available. These clinics and hospitals are already functioning and providing care. There would be no added burden. For those who are concerned about Federal tax dollars being used to provide abortion services, I point out that the current practice results in more direct expenditures of Federal funds than simply allowing a woman to pay for the cost of abortion-related services at a military facility. Current policy requires transportation costs that in some cases could be far more expensive than a privately funded abortion. 
   I also point out that there is a direct, positive impact on our military readiness when a woman is forced to take extended leave to travel for an abortion. 
   As we all know, women are no longer simply support staff in the military. Women command troops and are in key military readiness positions. Their contributions are beyond dispute. While women serve side by side with their male counterparts, they are subjected to an archaic and seemingly mean-spirited health care restriction. Women in our military deserve more respect and better treatment. 
   I think it is also important to remind my colleagues that this amendment will not change the current conscience clause for medical personnel. Health care professionals who object to providing safe and legal health services to women could still refuse to perform an abortion. No one in the military would be forced to perform any procedures that he or she objected to as a matter of conscience. 
   The current policy places our women at risk. Because the current policy is so cumbersome, women could be forced to undergo an abortion later in their pregnancy when risks and complications increase. They can, of course, try to obtain safe and legal abortion services in the host country in which they are serving--if there are no language or cultural barriers that hinder their access. 
   We should not tolerate situations that are occurring, such as what occurred to a woman serving our country in Japan. Because of our current policy, she was denied access to abortion services at the military facility, even at her own expense, and she was forced to go off base to secure a safe and legal abortion. She had no escort and no help from the military as she went to a foreign facility. She didn't understand the medical questions or the instructions, and she was terrified. I have her letter, and I will read it into the RECORD later. Our Government should never have forced her, as she was serving us overseas, into that circumstance. 
   Regardless of what some of my colleagues may think about the constitutional ruling guaranteeing a woman the right to a safe abortion without unnecessary burdens or obstacles, this is the law of the land. While some may oppose this right to choose, the Supreme Court and a majority of Americans support this right. It is the law of the land. However, active duty servicewomen stationed overseas surrender this right when they make the decision to volunteer to defend all of us. It is sadly ironic that we send them overseas to protect our rights; yet in the process we rob them of vital constitutional protections. 
   I urge my colleagues to support the Murray-Snowe amendment. Please allow women in the military the right to make their own health care choices without being forced to violate privacy and jeopardize their health and their careers. This is and must remain a personal decision. Women should not be subject to the approval or disapproval of their coworkers. 
   I stress this is not about Federal funding of abortions. This is about protecting women serving overseas and providing privately funded, safe, and legal abortions. I urge my colleagues to support our women in uniform by restoring their right to choose. 
   I reserve the remainder of my time.

   Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, my colleague and cosponsor, Senator SNOWE, is present in the Chamber. I will yield her time in just a moment. 
   I point out a woman's health care decision to have or not have an abortion should be with herself, her family, her doctor, and her religion. That is not the case in the military today. When a woman has to go to her commanding officer and request permission to fly home on a military transport, she no longer has the ability to make that decision on her own. It becomes a very public decision. 
   This amendment simply gives back her privacy and allows her to pay for at her own expense a health care procedure in a military hospital where she is safe and taken care of. 
   I am delighted my cosponsor, Senator SNOWE, is here, and I yield her as much time as she needs.

   Mrs. MURRAY. I thank the Chair. 
   Mr. President, I remind my colleagues of the issue we will be debating for the next 90 minutes. Basically, today a woman who serves in the military overseas at a facility, if she so desires to have an abortion--and it is her choice; it is her personal choice between herself and her family and her doctor and her religion--has to go to her commanding officer to ask for permission to come home to the United States to have a safe and legal abortion. Then she has to wait for military transport. She has to pay $10, as the opponents told us this morning, for food on that military transport, and come home in order to have a safe and legal abortion. 
   The pending amendment simply allows women who serve in our military overseas today to pay for their own medical choice decisions in a military hospital where it is safe and is a place where they can be assured they will be taken care of, as we should expect we would take care of all people who serve us in the military. 
   I have heard our opponents speak this morning on this amendment and say it is unnecessary. I have a letter  from a woman who served in our military services. I would like to share it with my colleagues who think it is unnecessary:

   Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I simply need to respond. The Murray-Snowe amendment is not asking for a fringe benefit. Let me make it very clear to everyone who is listening, what this amendment does is simply allow a woman who serves in the military overseas to pay for her own abortion services in a military hospital where it is safe and it is legal. It is not a fringe benefit. Health care choices for women who serve us overseas are not fringe benefits. They simply are the same right that is afforded to every woman who lives in this country.

   Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I will address a few of the issues that have been raised. 
   First, the Department of Defense stand on this: We have it confirmed that Secretary Cohen, the Secretary of Defense, does support this amendment. Several people have questioned Dr. Sue Bailey, who is Assistant Secretary of Defense, and wrote a very eloquent letter in support of this position. She did recently leave the Department. However, the Department's policy still is intact. Despite her being gone, the Department policy remains strongly the same. 
   Second, I keep hearing the question of taxpayer funds. Let me lay this out for everyone one more time. Current policy requires a woman who serves in the military overseas to go to her commanding officer and request permission for leave of absence. She cannot get free transport without giving them a reason why. She has to go to her commanding officer, most likely a male, explain to him that she needs abortion services, and then we provide her transportation back to the United States. Her transportation is usually on a C-17 or a military transport jet that I assume costs a lot more than an abortion procedure would in a military hospital. 
   What we are saying with this amendment is not to use taxpayer dollars, despite what the opponents keep asserting. We are simply asking that a woman who serves in the military overseas be allowed to pay for her own health care services in a military hospital so she can have access to a safe and legal abortion, just as women in this country do every day. 
   This is an issue of fairness. We are asking the women who serve in our military be allowed the services that every woman has a right to in this country. They are overseas fighting to protect our rights. Certainly, the least we can do is provide them rights as well. 
   I yield what time he needs to the Senator from Michigan, Mr. LEVIN.

   Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, any hospital today has to calculate costs. Certainly I give a lot of credence to our military hospitals and to the military officials who run them to 
   be able to do the same thing just as they have done prior to the time when women could have access to these abortions.

   Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, that question goes directly to what the military is able to do, which is to themselves figure out what the cost is and bill it. It is an easy thing to do. They have done it before. It is not up to me to calculate the cost. Our military officials who run our hospitals are highly qualified individuals who have the ability to figure out what their costs are.

   Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, we have the ability within our military hospitals right now to contract procurements of what our military personnel need. It would frighten me a great deal as a woman serving in the military if none of our military hospitals overseas knew how to perform an abortion in an emergency in case a woman's life is at risk, which we now need to know is available. If we are saying there are no doctors available anywhere in the entire world where we have service people available to perform that service, I would be frightened as a woman in the military service today if my life was at stake and there would not be a doctor available to help me.

   Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I only have 33 seconds. I find it incredible that the argument has been made that if we allow women to pay for their own abortions in military facilities overseas, it will undermine our relationships with our host countries. We have sovereign law that covers our military facilities. If we were to flip that argument, we could simply say that in a country that provides abortions, if we don't provide them in our hospitals, it may also seriously undermine our credibility. 
   This amendment is about allowing the women overseas who serve our country and fight for us every day the same rights as the women in this country. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment and to send a message to the women who serve us overseas that we, too, will fight for their rights.

   Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, we are about to vote on an amendment that will simply allow a woman who serves us overseas in the military to go to a military facility, if she so chooses, to have an abortion that is safe and legal. 
   Current law requires that a woman who serves us overseas go to her commanding officer and ask for permission to fly home on a military transport, at taxpayer expense--as I say, at taxpayer expense--to fly home on a military jet to have access to what is legally given to every woman in this country today. 
   I heard our opponents say that this is an issue of taxpayer-funded abortions. I disagree. The amendment disagrees. This will say that women will pay for their own abortions in the military facilities. 
   We ask women to serve us, to fight for our rights, to go overseas in conditions that are often intolerable, to fight for this country. In return, we tell them that a decision that should be theirs, and their families, along with their physician and their own religion, is no longer a private issue for them. 
   From women who serve us, we take away a right that has been established in this country for many years, and we tell them, if you serve in the military, that right is taken away from you. We are asking them to fight for our rights, but we are essentially taking away their rights. 
   This restores that right to women who serve us overseas, to have an abortion, if they so choose. This applies to military families--to wives and daughters, as well. 
   I ask my colleagues to simply say to the women who serve us overseas that we support you as much as we ask you to support us.

   Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I have come to the floor today to talk about a challenge the people of Washington State face. It is an environmental challenge, a legal challenge, and a moral challenge. That challenge is to rescue a symbol of the Pacific Northwest. 
   That challenge is to recover our wild Pacific salmon. 
   As anyone who lives in Washington State can tell you, the salmon of our region are more than a symbol. They are part of our culture, our heritage, our recreation, and our economy. 
   Unfortunately, the salmon that were once so abundant in our rivers and along our shores are now in danger. In fact, today several species of salmon are threatened with extinction. 
   When it comes to saving salmon, solutions are not easy to find. 
   There are so many different viewpoints to consider. Everyone from recreational and commercial fishermen to Native Americans and conservationists, to State, local, and Federal officials, along with private property owners have a role to play in helping us meet this challenge. 
   In my time here in the Senate, I have always worked to bring people together, and to find solutions that help us meet this challenge while still keeping our economy strong. 
   Today, I have come to the floor to share with my colleagues and the American people some progress we have recently made in meeting this challenge. 
   I am proud to report that just last week, we took a major step forward to save wild salmon. Seven days ago, the President designated a vital salmon spawning ground--known as the Hanford Reach--as a national monument. 
   I was proud to stand on the banks of the Columbia River, beside the Vice President, when this historic announcement was made. It was a dream come true. For a long time, many of us have dreamed of preserving the Reach. There are few places in the world like it. 
   For me and my family, as for many families throughout the region, the Columbia and Snake Rivers hold deep personal meaning. 
   My grandfather settled in the Tri-Cities in 1916. My dad grew up there. He watched his hometown become the home of a secret factory--a factory now known as the Hanford Nuclear Reservation, a factory that would give America the tools to win World War II. 
   When my dad came back from his military service in the Pacific theater, he was injured, and he had lost a lot of friends in combat. He wasn't the same. And the place he came back to wasn't the same either. 
   He knew that his hometown--perhaps more than any other--contributed to winning the war by producing the weapon that ended World War II. And he took a lot of pride in that fact. 
   In my own life, I have spent a lot of time in the Tri-Cities. Growing up, I remember during my summer vacation getting in our car and driving to the Tri-Cities to see my Grandma--watching the hydros and swimming in the river with my six brothers and sisters. 
   When I was in college, I spent a great summer working at Sacajawea State Park at the confluence of the Snake and Columbia Rivers. I came to respect the history of the area, and the people who lived in the community. 
   The first time I floated down the Hanford Reach of the Columbia River, I was with my daughter, Sara. We were so impressed with the beautiful landscape, the fish and the wildlife, and the reminders of the vibrant Native American culture that abounds along the Hanford Reach. 
   As we floated along, we saw the reactors, and I told her about the role the Tri-Cities played in helping America win World War II and about her grandfather's part in that important piece of history. We were both deeply affected by that day on the river, and it is a memory I cherish. 
   When I started fighting to protect the Hanford Reach, my dad told me he thought it was great that I was working to give something back to a community that had given so much to our family and to our country. So last Friday, when Vice President GORE announced the designation of the Hanford Reach of the Columbia River as a national monument, the toughest part of that day for me was that I had lost my father a few years ago and he was not there to see it happen. 
   The national monument designation doesn't just enable us to remember our past, it allows us to capture our future--in large part by saving wild salmon. 
   The Hanford Reach spans only 51 miles of the Columbia River's 1,200 miles, but it spawns 80% of the wild fall Chinook produced in the entire Columbia Basin. 
   Thanks to the designation, this vital breeding ground has been protected. 
   The designation also preserves the unique history of this area. 
   Generations of Americans will be able to learn about the sacrifices that the people of the Tri-Cities made to help America win World War II, and generations more will be able to learn about the long Native American history along the Columbia River. 
   In addition, the designation will ensure that families can use the river for recreation for years into the future. 
   This is the right thing to do. And doing the right thing also means keeping your promises. 
   The people of the Tri-Cities have been given too many broken promises. I do not intend to be another link in that chain. 
   The designation is not the end of the process, but the beginning. 
   As I told the people of the Tri-Cities last week, I will continue to work with local leaders to ensure that their voices are heard. Working together--with an open dialogue--we can reach the best solution. 
   Over the years, a lot of people helped make the designation possible. 
   Mr. President, I want the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD to forever reflect the tireless work of people like Rick Leaumont, Rich Steele, Bob Wilson, Laura Smith, Mike Lilga, Jim Watts, and Dave Goeke. 
   I thank the person who worked side-by-side with me in the House as we developed legislative solutions for how to protect the Reach, Congressman NORM DICKS, and also JAY INSLEE, who has worked hard on this issue. 
   I also thank the members of my advisory committee, the tribes, and so many members of my staff who spent countless hours to save this valuable resource. 
   I thank Governor Gary Locke for his leadership. 
   I thank Secretary Babbitt for recognizing the unique value of the Hanford Reach, and Secretary Richardson for his help over the years on this and other issues related to Hanford. 
   Of course, we owe a debt of thanks to the President and the Vice President. 
   Over the years, we have asked much of the Columbia River, and it has always given generously. It has given us affordable energy, turned a desert into a farming oasis, and provided a highway for international commerce. 
   It is amazing how so very few times in our lives we are given the opportunity to truly give something to future generations. That is what we are doing with the designation of the Hanford Reach as a National Monument. 
   Today, I take a moment to thank a person who deserves a tremendous amount of credit for the progress we have made in the Pacific Northwest. 
   Time and again the Vice President has demonstrated his commitment to protecting our Nation's natural resources while ensuring that we have the strongest economy in our Nation's history. 
   He helped us develop habitat conservation plans that allow us to conserve our environment while providing stability to our economy. He made our salmon treaty with Canada a priority for the U.S. Government, and for the past two years he has led the fight to save struggling salmon runs. 
   To meet the challenges that we will undoubtedly face in the coming years, we will need a strong partnership at every level--from the folks on the ground to local, State, and Federal officials. There is no person--no one--who is better qualified to provide the leadership to bring us together and to help us solve our toughest problems than AL GORE. The people of Washington State are grateful for his leadership and appreciate the gift that this designation is to future generations. 
   Before I close, I believe it is important to address one final point on this  subject. I understand Governor Bush plans to visit my State on Monday. I expect he will be impressed by what he sees, and he is always welcome in Washington. I am glad he is making the trip because, unlike President Clinton and Vice President GORE, I do not believe Governor Bush has spent much time there. 
   Governor Bush, the people of Washington want to know three things: 
   First, will you make a commitment to protect the Hanford Reach National Monument? 
   Will you commit to saving salmon? 
   And most importantly, what is your plan for saving salmon? 
   When you come to Washington State, Governor Bush, those are the questions people will be asking. 
   Quite frankly, Mr. President, when it comes to the Hanford Reach, I believe that the Governor needs to know that those in Washington State who are close to him opposed Federal protection of the Hanford Reach--a designation that will save the last free-flowing stretch of the Columbia River--and the best salmon spawning ground we have. 
   I believe the voters of Washington State deserve to know what Governor Bush's intentions are. 
   And on the issue of preserving salmon on the Snake River, I have heard Governor Bush articulate what he won't do, but I have yet to hear what he would do to protect our region's economy while restoring wild salmon runs. 
   His spokespeople attacked the Vice President on his latest visit to Washington State when the Vice President indicated his personal interest in helping the region solve the tricky issues related to salmon restoration. Bush's people offered no plan, they just attacked the Vice President for having one. 
   The people of Washington want to hear plans for saving salmon--not just attacks, but credible, responsible plans. 
   Let me be clear: When it comes to helping the people of Washington State meet environmental challenges, just saying ``no'' doesn't cut it. The people of my State deserve to know what the President would do to save salmon. 
   When the Vice President was in Washington State recently he met this challenge head-on. He very clearly committed to saving salmon. He said that extinction was not an option. And he indicated that in his administration, he would call a summit to bring together diverse views so we can work together to save salmon. 
   He faced the issue in a thoughtful, responsible way. 
   In fact, many of my constituents came up to me after the Vice President spoke to tell me how impressed they were with the Vice President's understanding of the issue and his commitment to protecting our natural resources, and to thank me for his leadership on this critical challenge. 
   Mr. President, the ball is clearly in Governor Bush's court, and it is time for him to provide his own answers and vision. 
   When Governor Bush enters the State of Washington, residents will be listening for his commitment to the Hanford Reach National Monument, listening for his commitment to saving salmon, and listening for his plan to save salmon. 
   The people of my State care about this issue. They deserve to hear specific answers. 
   I suggest that if Governor Bush leaves Washington State without addressing the concerns of Washington State voters on the issue of salmon recovery, it would suggest that his trip was more about politics and photo-ops than addressing the concerns of Washington State voters. 
   I urge Governor Bush to respect the concerns of the people of my State, to address their concerns and to answer their questions. 
   I pledge to work with the next President to implement a plan that will save salmon while keeping our economy sound. 
   My hope is for a President who is willing to work with me and the other citizens of Washington State in a constructive fashion to address the complex issues related to recovering the once might runs of wild salmon on the Snake and Columbia Rivers. 
   I believe the people of Washington State deserve nothing less.

   Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise today to express my support for S..1128, the Estate Tax Elimination Act. 
   Mr. President, I came to understand the impact of the federal estate tax during my first campaign for election to the U.S. Senate. As I met with hundreds of small businessmen and women, timber lot owners, and farmers and ranchers, I consistently heard the federal estate tax was a major road-block to the long-term success of their family operations. 
   But when I came to the Senate in 1993, it appeared it would be a long time before Congress could take action on the estate tax, or any other tax issue for that matter. We faced deficits as far as the eye could see. We had to make hard choices about spending cuts and tax relief for the neediest families. I'm pleased that my colleagues and I on the Democratic side made those tough choices in 1993 and in subsequent years. Combined with a strong economy, those tough choices gave us the opportunity to be in the position we are in today. 
   The effort to roll back the federal estate tax, and provide relief for farms and small businesses, started slowly. In 1995, I joined those efforts by introducing S..161, the American Family Business Preservation Act. Senator Bob Dole was the prime Republican cosponsor of this measure. With respect to the estate tax, the Murray-Dole bill would have reduced the maximum estate tax rate from 55 percent to 15 percent if the heirs continued to own and operate a business for ten years after the death of the primary owner. Given the limited resources we had, I believed this modest bill was a good step forward. 
   In 1997, Congress passed the Taxpayer Relief Act, a bipartisan effort to reduce taxes for working Americans. The bill provided for an increase in the estate tax exemption over ten years, and created an additional exemption for small business and farm assets. I supported this bipartisan initiative to provide estate tax relief to my constituents. As it is phased in, this law will help to ensure the very small percentage of estates subject to the estate tax bill grow even smaller. 
   But we should all recognize the environment has changed. As projected surpluses have grown, the debate about the estate tax has turned from increasing the exemption to outright repeal. Estate tax opponents have made their case for elimination, and it's compelling. The question for me is no longer whether the estate tax will or should be repealed, but how and when it will be repealed. I believe one of the appropriate roles for Democrats in this debate--the same Democrats who helped balance the budget--is to ensure that we promote as progressive an end to the estate tax as possible. 
   At this moment in time, I believe S..1128 is the most progressive estate tax repeal vehicle that is under consideration. Instead of taxing an estate when it is transferred to the next generation, it 
   would require heirs to pay a capital gains tax on appreciated value when the asset is sold. This provides an effective mechanism for transferring farm and business assets, while still maintaining a reasonably progressive tax structure.  
   I understand there is some debate about whether S. 1128 or similar proposals will increase the tax code's complexity. Now that the House has overwhelmingly passed estate tax repeal, we have an ideal opportunity to engage in a serious, thoughtful debate about the current effects of the estate tax and the possible implications of various repeal proposals. I believe by the end of this year, Congress, the Administration, and the American public will have a better understanding of the complex choices we face. 
   I would like to make it clear that I do not believe estate tax repeal should be the only tax priority of this or future Congresses. There are many inequities, complexities, and inefficiencies in the tax code, many of which affect low- and middle-income working families who need tax relief the most. 
   In the spirit of helping those who need it the most, I have cosponsored legislation to address the alternative minimum tax and the marriage penalty. In addition, I have cosponsored tax legislation to expand health insurance, improve the infrastructure of our nation's public schools, encourage alternative energy sources, enhance the safety net for farmers and ranchers, and increase the availability of child care and long-term care. Last year, I sponsored tax legislation to protect forest and agricultural land, which passed the Senate in July. 
   Estate tax relief should certainly be an important component in any agenda to provide relief and economic opportunities to working families and family-owned businesses. Therefore, I support estate tax repeal in the context of a modest, targeted tax cut benefitting working families. 
   Before the end of the year, Congress and the Administration will likely reach agreement on a reconciliation package. Further reform--if not repeal--of the estate tax should be a part of that package. While repeal may not be possible this year, I look forward to strongly supporting increased exemptions for small business and farm assets. At the very least, we should guarantee a brighter and less complicated future for those families that need estate tax reform the most. 
   I urge my colleagues to cosponsor S. 1128, and to work toward meaningful action on the estate tax issue before Congress adjourns this fall.

   Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise today to mark a solemn occasion in the lives of the people of my home State of Washington. 
   Many of my colleagues have heard me talk on the Senate floor about pipeline safety. 
   Today I want to remind everyone of the reason I have become such a strong advocate for improving pipeline safety. 
   June 10--one year ago, coming up this Saturday--will be the first anniversary of a horrible pipeline accident in Bellingham, WA. 
   In that accident, a gasoline pipeline ruptured and released more than 275,000 gallons of gasoline into Whatcom Creek. That gasoline caught fire and sent a fireball racing 1 1/2 miles down the creek side. It created a plume of black smoke that rose more than 20,000 feet into the air. 
   Two 10-year-old boys and a young man were enjoying the outdoors on that quiet summer afternoon. Tragically, they died as a result of that pipeline rupture. 
   Three families in Bellingham, WA, will never be the same because of the events that took place on June 10, 1999. 
   As we mark this anniversary, we can never forget the lives that were lost. 
   For just a moment I want to ask my colleagues and the American people to pay tribute to those young lives; Wade King, Stephen Tsiorvas, and Liam Wood. I also want to honor their parents--who have endured a loss that no family should have to experience. 
   They have shown such strength and courage. They have led the charge for safer pipelines, and their advocacy has made a difference. 
   Their courage was clear to everyone who attended the Senate Commerce Committee field hearing in Bellingham on March 13 and to everyone who heard them testify just last month here in Washington, DC, before the Commerce Committee. 
   They came to Washington, DC, to ask for one thing. They want this Congress to improve pipeline standards this year. This Congress--this year. 
   I believe we have a moral obligation to do everything we can to meet the parents' wishes and to protect everyone else from pipeline hazards. That is why I have been working to raise the safety standards for oil and gas pipelines. 
   There are 2.2 million miles of pipelines running across the country. They run near our schools, our homes, and our communities. 
   They perform a vital service. They bring us the energy we need to fuel our cars and heat our homes. 
   But at the same time, they are not as safe as they could be. We have a responsibility to pass a bill this year that will protect families from the dangers of unsafe pipelines. 
   To be honest, I--like many Americans--was not aware of those dangers until the accident in my State. 
   But as I spent months learning about pipelines, I found that the accident in my State was not a rare event. 
   Since 1986, there have been more than 5,700 pipeline accidents in this country, 325 deaths, 1,500 injuries, and almost $1 billion in environmental damage. 
   On average there is one pipeline accident every day in this country, and 6 million hazardous gallons are spilled into our environment every year. 
   That is why back in January I introduced my own pipeline safety bill--the Pipeline Safety Act of 2000. I want to thank the Members who have signed on as cosponsors--Senators INOUYE, GORTON, WYDEN, LAUTENBERG, and BAYH. 
   I want my colleagues to know, in the 4 months since I introduced my pipeline safety bill, at least 20 States have experienced pipeline accidents. In addition to my bill, pipeline safety measures have been offered by Senate Commerce Committee Chairman JOHN MCCAIN and by the administration. 
   I am pleased that all of the current proposals touch on five key areas of pipeline safety. First, all of these bills recognize the need to improve pipeline inspection and accident prevention practices, second, they recognize the need to develop and invest in new safety and inspection technology, third--and importantly--they expand the Public's right to know about problems with pipelines in their neighborhoods, fourth, they recognize that States can be better partners in improving pipeline safety. Finally, these bills increase funding for new State and Federal pipeline safety programs. 
   I thank Senator MCCAIN for the strong personal interest he has taken in this issue. I thank him for the very effective way he has worked to move this legislation forward. The Senate  Commerce Committee has tentatively scheduled a markup session for June 15. 
   Senator GORTON and I are working with both the majority and minority members of the Senate Commerce Committee to come up with a manager's package that will meet the standards we have outlined and will be acceptable to as many members as possible. 
   As we work here in the Senate on this important legislation, I want to encourage my colleagues in the House of Representatives to move forward quickly on their legislation so this Congress can pass a bill this year. 
   One of the things that has been so important over the past year is that so many people have come together to improve pipeline safety. And while I don't have time to thank them all, I do want to mention a few. 
   First among them is Bellingham's Mayor Mark Asmundson, who has done more to educate the public and legislators about pipeline safety than anyone I know. 
   I also want to recognize Transportation Secretary Rodney Slater who stationed a pipeline inspector in my State after the accident, and DOT Inspector General Kenneth Mead, who issued a report at my request on the Office of Pipeline Safety. 
   I also thank the President and the Vice President for their leadership. 
   In particular, the Vice President took the time to learn about this issue when he was in my State. He recognizes its importance, and he sent the administration's pipeline safety bill to the Senate. 
   I also thank the rest of the Washington State delegation--which has come together across party lines to address this issue--particularly my colleague Senator GORTON, along with Representatives from our delegtion. 
   And of course, I want to recognize Washington State Governor, Gary Locke, for the work he has done to raise pipeline standards in our State. 
   Mr. President, one year has passed since the accident in Bellingham, WA, that you can see on the chart behind me. 
   We have made some progress, but we need to finish the job. 
   We need to pass a strong pipeline safety bill this year. We owe it to the people of Bellingham, the victim's families, and to the American people. As we mark the 1-year anniversary of the Bellingham explosion, we must answer the call of the families with a strong bill. Nothing can ease the pain of this anniversary for so many people in my State, but we can and we must use this occasion to enact stronger pipeline safety standards. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I thank my colleague for yielding to me. 
   I come to the floor for a brief moment to pay tribute to the victims of gun violence who were killed one year ago today. 
   We are all familiar with the incidents of gun violence in our schools; from Columbine to Springfield, OR, to Paducah, KY, and unfortunately to so many other schools and communities. 
   Gun violence is particularly disturbing when it happens in a school. 
   But gun violence happens everywhere. A member of my staff lost a son to gun violence. Her son was simply stopping at a convenience store when he was robbed and killed. 
   How many families have to suffer unnecessarily before this Congress passes commonsense gun control legislation?

   Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Access to Innovation for Medicare Patients Act of 2000 and to thank my fellow colleague from Washington state, Senator GORTON, for his work on this important legislation. The Access to Innovation for Medicare Patients Act is critical for Medicare beneficiaries who suffer from chronic and debilitating diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis. 
   As many of you know, rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis most often affect women. Until recently, few treatments existed. But advances in biotechnology products have given hope to thousands of individuals. Self-injectable biologic therapies have proven highly effective in reducing the daily, chronic pain that accompanies these devastating diseases. Patients have reported amazing results from self-injectable biologic therapies such as Enbrel in clinical trials. 
   However, before the Access to Innovation for Medicare Patients Act, no legislation existed that addressed adequate Medicare coverage of these therapies. Currently, Medicare only covers physician-administered therapies and most Medicare prescription drug coverage proposals do not address this issue at all or they place restrictive coverage caps on the use of self-injectable biologic therapies. Beneficiaries should not be denied access to the most effective and convenient therapies for their condition. Ultimately, coverage of self-injectable biologic therapies could save Medicare money in reducing costly, prolonged hospital stays and reducing the number of care provider visits. Most importantly, this legislation will improve the lives of Medicare beneficiaries who suffer from these diseases. Congress must ensure that seniors and the disabled receive the best possible medical treatment and therapies through the Medicare program. 
   Finally, on a more personal note, my family has had first-hand experience with the constant pain and frustration caused by multiple sclerosis. My father suffered from this devastating disease, and I witnessed his daily fight to overcome the pain that accompanied it. I know that self-injectable biologic therapy may have made his fight much easier. We cannot allow Medicare beneficiaries to suffer from preventable, overwhelming pain. 
   In the past, we worked to eliminate barriers to care and research. Today, we seek to tear down Medicare's barriers to self-injectable biologic therapies. Seniors and the disabled should not be denied these life-saving, treatments simply because they are self-injected. 
   Therefore, I rise today to join my colleagues, Senators GORTON, MIKULSKI, COCHRAN, STEVENS, and CHAFEE in introducing the Access to Innovation for Medicare Patients Act. This legislation would: provide access to innovative therapies that are now on the market and making enormous improvements in the life and care of Medicare beneficiaries; allow physicians to prescribe the most appropriate therapy for their patients; make a common-sense, responsible change in Medicare; and eliminate the current bias against biotechnology therapies inherent in the Medicare program and many of the prescription drug proposals. 
   I urge all of my colleagues to join me in supporting this legislation.

   Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I commend my colleague from Maryland, Senator MIKULSKI, for her leadership and for her fine statement on this important issue that is before the Senate today. 
   I am very proud to join my many colleagues who are here to commend the men and women of the U.S. Capitol Police Force. Day in and day out, these fine officers risk their lives to protect all of us who work in the legislative branch. They also protect the millions of people who travel from across the country to the Capitol every year. 
   They deserve our respect and they deserve our thanks. They certainly do not deserve pink slips. Unfortunately, that is what the budget that was recently passed by the House Republicans would give them. In fact, in the budget that was passed by the House Appropriations Committee, if it were to take effect, 438 members of the Capitol Police Force would be relieved of duty. That is no way to thank some of the hardest working and most dedicated people I have ever encountered. At the same time that security experts are recommending to us we hire additional officers so we can station two officers at every entrance, the House majority's proposal goes in the opposite direction and requires us to fire officers. 
   Many people who are visiting the Nation's Capitol often turn to our Capitol Police Force for help in finding their representatives' offices or to get tour information. 
   While our officers are always very gracious and helpful to everyone, the public really does not get a chance to see the many other things they do. 
   Every day, these officers interact with thousands of people, constantly  assessing potential threats and stopping problems before they ever have a chance to start. 
   In fact, in recent days, there have been two potential instances of violence in this Capitol complex. Thanks to the quick work of the Capitol Police, and others, those situations were quickly controlled and no one was injured. 
   In a world where the number of threats seem to be growing, in an age when you never know when someone will act violently, and in a time when the memories of the two officers who died protecting Members of this Congress are still fresh in our minds, we are all better off with a strong, professional, and well-trained Capitol Police. 
   I think it is fair to say that through their work they help all of us carry out the democratic process. 
   They do not just protect elected officials; they protect everyone who visits and works near the Capitol Building. 
   I have been very disappointed to hear what some of the House Republicans have said about the Capitol Police. I do not think those comments reflect accurately on the work of the Capitol Police. I certainly do not want the officers to think that those few Members reflect the way the rest of us feel about the work that you do. 
   I encourage my colleagues to do three things to honor these fine men and women. 
   First, I hope Members, as they go about their daily work, take a moment to say thank you to the men and women of the Capitol Police Force, and let them know how much you appreciate the fine work they do. 
   Secondly, don't let the House Republican budget slap these officers in the face. Instead, let's give them the tools and the resources they need to do their jobs effectively. 
   Finally, I hope all Members of the Senate will vote for the sense-of-the-Senate resolution and show that you stand with us in supporting our Capitol Police. 
   I join the Senator from Maryland in commending Senator BENNETT and Senator FEINSTEIN for doing an outstanding job. I hope we can adopt this resolution with a very strong vote so that we can maintain the numbers that they have worked to put into this budget. 
   I thank the Chair and yield the floor.

   Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I commend my colleague from California, Senator FEINSTEIN, who has done a remarkable job in presenting this issue to the Senate on behalf of not only her constituents but on behalf of many of us across the country. I thank the Senator for her leadership. 
   I yield myself 10 minutes. 
   I rise today, as well, in support of the amendment before the Senate. I pose a question to the Members of this body, a question asked by 750,000 mothers, fathers, and children who gathered in our Nation's Capital for the Million Mom March this past weekend. It is a question being asked by tens of thousands of people who took part in rallies across 70 cities in this country this last weekend. It is a question being asked after every school shooting and after every other act of gun violence. 
   I ask my colleagues: What will it take to get this Congress to pass commonsense gun legislation? Do we have to wait for more innocent people to lose their lives before this Congress will act? Currently, 12 children die every day from gunfire. Do we have to wait for our homes and places of worship to become crime scenes? Lord knows, we have seen enough of that. Do we have to wait for our schools, places  where our children should feel safe and loved, to become war zones? 
   We have already had school shootings in many cities: Littleton, Deming, Jonesboro, Flint, Conyers, Pearl, Fort Gibson, Springfield, and Moses Lake in my home State of Washington. Do we have to wait for a million people to rally here in D.C. and across the country to get this Congress to act? We just had that this past weekend. Do we have to wait for a shooting to take place right here in the Nation's Capitol Building to act? We have already had that. Do we have to wait until no place is safe for this Congress to pass commonsense legislation? We are getting closer to that every day. It is not getting any better. It seems the accidents are all the more common. It seems the shock and the pain and the loss keep growing, but this Congress has not acted. 
   What is it going to take for this Congress to pass commonsense gun legislation? I want to give my colleagues a reason to act. I want to share with them a personal story about how gun violence is tearing our country apart. It is a story from a member of my own staff in Washington State. She is a wonderful woman named Mary Glen, who lost her son in a tragic robbery. It is something that has had a tremendous impact on her and on me. I know I cannot convey, or even imagine, the horror she has been through. But I also know that her voice must be heard by this Congress, so I want to read to you what she said in her own words at the Million Mom March in Seattle, WA, this past weekend. 
   I truly commend her for her courage, telling her story so openly and allowing me to share it with you today. Mary Glen said:  
   On Jan. 1st 1994 I awoke to a knock at the door, two police officers were standing there with the news that my 15-year-old son, Shaun was dead. Shot in the back, robbed of his money and his clothes. 
   As Shaun left a convenience store after purchasing a pizza early New Year's morning of 1994, two young men took him by gun point, forced him into a car, drove him a couple blocks away, made him strip out of his clothes, took his money and then ordered him out of the car. They then shot him in the back! What a cowardly act. My world was torn apart that day but all I could think of is I can't let this happen to anyone else's child. 
   As a mother, I had been a good parent, but that wasn't enough as I found out. It didn't matter how good of a parent I was, because when Shaun was out of my sight I couldn't protect him from what happened. 
   Sixteen days later I was speaking to other Moms who had lost loved ones due to guns. 
   In February of 1994, just 6 weeks after I buried Shaun, I spoke before the Washington State Legislature, telling my story and asking for stricter gun laws, telling them, if they had tears in their eyes after just hearing my story, which they did, imagine how I must feel having to survive it and go on without my son. 
   This kind of violence is preventable. In April of 1994, Senator Feinstein invited me back to Washington, DC for a press conference on the assault weapons ban, part of the 1994 Crime Bill....... 
   There, I met with others who had lost loved ones and together we spoke out about gun violence to anyone who would give us the time. The effects of gun violence are very brutal and personal for me....... 
   This isn't about being pro or anti gun it's about saving our children who leave our houses and are not coming home. The devastating effects don't magically stop. It's an ongoing struggle....... 
   If I could have one wish answered for Mother's Day this is what it would be: That every person who screams about their 2nd amendment rights and the need to own a gun without wanting to be held accountable for the responsibilities that go with it, feel the pain of losing a child to murder for one day--because then doing the right thing wouldn't even have to be argued.  
   Those are the words of Mary Glen. She is a member of my staff in Washington State, and I could not agree with Mary more. She is a survivor. She is a strong and loving woman. I got to know her through her work with Mothers Against Violence in America. So, again, after sharing Mary's story with all of you I ask: What will it take for this Congress to pass commonsense gun laws? 
   Last year, in the juvenile justice bill, the Senate passed commonsense gun restrictions. We closed the gun show loophole; we mandated trigger locks on all handgun sales; we enacted legislation to ensure that violent juveniles cannot buy weapons; and we banned the importation of high-capacity ammunition clips. Unfortunately, this Congress has failed to make that bill law. The juvenile justice bill has languished in the conference committee for nearly a year. 
   Some opponents of commonsense laws say we are not doing enough to enforce the laws that are already on the books. This administration has done more to protect children from gun violence than any in our Nation's history. Gun prosecutions overall have increased nearly 30 percent in the Clinton-Gore administration. Of course, there is more we can do, and the President has proposed increasing the number of Federal gun prosecutors and helping States with their gun prosecutions and enforcement. But at the end of the day, all of the excuses and all the doubletalk from opponents will not save one life. Sensible gun laws will save lives. But first we have to get this Congress to act. 
   Today, with this amendment, we are asking this Congress to act in a small and symbolic way. We are asking this Congress to commend those who took part in the Million Mom March. It is the least we can do for a group of people who have suffered losses many of us cannot even imagine. They have asked: What will it take for this Congress to pass commonsense gun legislation? Let's answer them by showing we are ready to protect Americans from gun violence. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.

   Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I am pleased to be on the floor today to offer the fiscal year 2001 military construction appropriations bill. I thank Senator BURNS, the chairman of our committee, and his staff, for being so good in a great bipartisan manner, in being able to work this bill through again this year. I publicly thank him for his work with me in a really solid manner. I appreciate the way he has done that. 
   Before I address this bill, I want to address some comments that were made about me on this floor by the majority leader just a short time ago. 
   While I was taking part in a hearing of the Senate Commerce Committee as part of my work to improve pipeline safety in this country, I understand the majority leader suggested that my schedule was a reason why a debate on commonsense gun control was not going to take place today. 
   Given the work that I have done over the years to protect young people from gun violence, and my strong support of this weekend's Million Mom March, I was rather surprised by that suggestion. I assure my colleagues that this debate is too important to be delayed any longer. 
   While I support the majority leader's concern about a family obligation I have; namely, my son is going to be married, there is no excuse for not debating this legislation--especially the absence of any one Member. 
   If this had been a concern of the majority leader, perhaps he could have spoken to me personally before incorrectly citing me as the reason why the Senate would not be debating gun violence today. 
   I would like to remind the majority leader that, on November 4, I came to the floor, in the wake of a fatal shooting in my home State, and urged the Members of the Senate to work with me on commonsense solutions to gun violence. Since that time, it has been the congressional majority that has prevented this much needed debate from taking place, and it is the congressional majority today that, again, refuses to address this vital issue. 
   I would like to remind my colleagues that, on average, 12 children die every day from gunfire. We cannot wait any longer. 
   Mr. President, I will now turn to the issue before us. 
   I again am pleased to be here with my chairman, Senator BURNS, in recommending the fiscal year 2001 military construction appropriations bill to the Senate for its approval. 
   This is an unusual bill this year because it contains emergency supplemental funding for a number of defense items not related to military construction, including U.S. participation in the Kosovo peacekeeping operation and in the Colombia counternarcotics initiative. 
   I will defer to my ranking member on the full committee, Senator BYRD, and others, to address the items in the supplemental portion of this bill, and I will confine my remarks to the military construction portion of the bill. 
   This bill provides a total of $8.634 billion in new spending authority for military construction for fiscal year 2001. 
   This level of funding exceeds the President's budget request for military construction by $600 million, and provides nearly $300 million above the amount appropriated for fiscal year 2000. 
   Nevertheless, as usual, this bill comes up short of what the services need to meet their infrastructure requirements. 
   At the risk of sounding like a broken record, I once again urge the administration to increase the budget for military construction. 
   This is a bricks-and-mortar bill. 
   There is nothing glamorous or ``gee-whiz'' about aircraft hangars or barracks or armories. 
   But this is an essential bill, and the projects that it funds are vital to our men and women in uniform.  
   As many of my colleagues have pointed out to me in the course of developing this bill, the President's budget barely scratches the surface or infrastructure needs. 
   The requests that Senator BURNS and I have received this year address compelling needs throughout the services, and I wish that we had the resources to fund more of them. 
   Senator BURNS and his staff deserve a great deal of credit for their dedicated and thoughtful approach in drafting this bill. 
   As always, they have worked very hard to produce a balanced, bipartisan product that takes into account both the concerns of the Senate and the needs of the military. 
   In particular, they have done a superb job of continuing to shine the spotlight on the quality of life projects that are so important to our men and women in uniform, and to their families. 
   At a time when military enlistment and retention are declining--and the services are unable to match the financial incentives of the private sector--quality of life issues are amplified in importance. 
   Quality of life issues do not diminish the importance of readiness projects, but we must not dismiss their role in recruiting and retaining our military personnel. 
   Within the budget constraints that we are all forced to operate this year, this bill attempts to meet the most urgent and timely military construction needs with very limited resources. 
   All of the major construction projects that we have funded have been authorized. 
   In addition, we have ensured adequate funding for family housing and barracks construction. 
   However, I remain concerned that the nation's overall investment in military infrastructure continues to lag, and I hope we will see a more robust effort in future budgets. 
   This is an extremely important bill for our nation and our military forces. 
   I again commend Senator BURNS, and I thank the staff of the Appropriations Committee, including Sid Ashworth, Christina Evans, and Sonia King, as well as Mark Borreson, a fellow on my staff, for their excellent work in producing the bill. 
   Mr. President, I look forward to completing action on this important piece of legislation. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.

    Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the long and exemplary service of Washington State University (WSU) President Samuel H. Smith and his wife Pat Smith.  
   Samuel Smith has served as President of WSU since July of 1985, and he will be retiring at the end of the month. 
   Under Dr. Smith's leadership, the University has prospered. During his tenure, he strengthened the undergraduate and graduate curricula and worked to increase opportunities for women and minorities. 
   As a result of President Smith's work, many programs at WSU have received national and worldwide recognition. 
   President Smith deserves special honor for expanding the number of people who benefit from the University's educational system and for bringing education at WSU into the Information Age. 
   Dr. Smith established branch campuses of WSU in Vancouver, the Tri-Cities, and in Spokane, opening the doors of higher education to an even greater number of Washingtonians. 
   These branch campuses serve transition communities, helping people build the skills and training they need to succeed in today's workplace. Their lives are improving thanks to Dr. Smith's vision. 
   Dr. Smith was also instrumental in expanding educational opportunities to remote areas through WSU's innovative distance-learning programs. 
   One of the clearest examples of the way WSU has grown during Dr. Smith's tenure is the fact that more than one-third of all WSU graduates in the University's history were granted degrees by President Smith. 
   Dr. Smith has also been a member of and a leader in many national educational organizations. He is the Chair of the National Association of State Universities and Land-Grant Colleges Board of Directors for 2000. He is also a member of the Kellogg Commission on the Future of State and Land-Grant Universities. 
   He is a member of the Board of Trustees of the Western Governors University. He has also served as Chair of the Executive Committee of the National Collegiate Athletic Association. For his exemplary service, Dr. Smith has received many honors and awards for his work in these organizations. 
   President Smith is a native of Salinas, California, and holds bachelor's and doctoral degrees in plant pathology from the University of California at Berkeley and honorary doctoral degrees from Nihon University in Tokyo, Japan, and Far Eastern State University in Vladivostok, Russia. 
   Mr. President, I also want my colleagues to know that Pat Smith has been an instrumental figure in the growth of Washington State University. 
   From her position on the Washington State Arts Commission, she worked to expand the art collection and increase awareness of the WSU Museum of Art. She also serves on the boards of the Girl Scouts of the Inland Northwest and the United Way of Pullman, Washington. 
   Mrs. Smith is also from Salinas, California, and is a graduate of Salinas Union High School. She studied at Hartnell College in Salinas, California. 
   Mr. President, as a citizen of Washington state and as an alumna of Washington State University, I could not be more proud of the great job that President Smith and Pat Smith have done in expanding educational opportunities for the people of my state and nation and making my alma mater an even brighter beacon of learning and opportunity. 
   Mr. President, in closing I would like to say--on behalf of the people of my state and the many graduates, faculty members and current students of Washington State University--thank you President and Mrs. Smith. 
   Thank you for putting your compassion, energy and leadership to such good use at the helm of Washington State University. 
   Your presence will be missed, but the many gifts you gave us serve as a constant reminder of your many years of generous service.

   Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I congratulate the Senators from Michigan and Florida for addressing an issue I think all of us really need to address; that is, how do we recruit and retain good teachers in our classrooms today? 
   I think all of us whose kids are in public schools want to know our child will go to school and get the best teacher in that school. The question before us is, How do we make that happen? How do we ensure every one of our kids gets a really good teacher? 
   I have to say I am disappointed in the proposal our colleagues on the other side of the aisle came up with on merit pay. We have heard a lot of slogans in this debate. So far, from the other side, we have heard about private school vouchers, block grants, and now we are getting merit pay and testing for teachers. They all sound really good. 
   But I assure my colleagues, as someone who has been a teacher, someone who has been a school board member, someone who served in the State legislature, slogans don't teach kids; they don't keep good teachers in our classrooms; they don't improve test scores. 
   We are right in looking at the question of how we assure that we have good teachers. I was on a school board.  I have debated the issue of merit pay, which, by the way, school districts can now do and which State legislatures can now do. 
   As a Senator, I ask you to give us an example of a current school district that has merit pay in place that is working. We have not heard of any. I will tell you why. Because when you get down to the question of what does merit pay really do and you start to look at it, you realize that merit pay doesn't accomplish what we really want 
   in ensuring that all of our kids get a good education. 
   Good current educational policy and curriculum standards are what we want to teach our kids today. It is not how to sit at a desk, listen to an adult, do everything right all day long, and not move but, rather, how to work together in teams and how to work together with other students because that is what is required of them when they get into the workforce. Very few jobs today have a single person sitting at a desk doing the same task all day long. 
   Merit rewards an individual teacher pitted against another teacher rather than encouraging teachers to work together in their building to improve the education of all of our children. 
   That is what we are trying to teach our children. The best way to do that is by example--encouraging teachers in a building to work together. Certainly different teachers in every building have different skills. Certainly some of them do better with one child, or another child, or another curriculum piece. 
   We must encourage everyone to work together rather than saying we are going to pick the best three or four of you and give you an extra incentive; we encourage a teacher to come and be the principal's pet, or to be there to work the longest, or to try to show that they are somehow better than the other teachers. You start getting teachers pitted against each other. That is not what we want in a good school building. We want all the teachers supporting each other. 
   The best schools I have been in are ones where all of the first grade teachers get together after school, or support each other throughout the day, or share their curriculum. Who is going to share their curriculum, or share the good things that work in their classroom, if that means they may not be the teacher who gets the merit pay? That is why school boards and States have not enacted merit pay. It is simply another slogan we put out here. 
   I think we really need to concentrate on what works. How can we ensure that we recruit the best and brightest? How can we ensure that people want to go into the teaching profession, that we keep the best and brightest, and help those who need additional skills to be the best and the brightest? 
   Think back through your own education. I don't know how many Senators have gone to public schools all their lives. I have, my kids have, and I have been in them. I know. When I look back at my education, or my children's education, and I think about all the teachers I had--think about this: Which one would you pick to get merit pay? It is difficult to do because all of us have had really good teachers. Our kids have had good teachers, and all of us have had good teachers. 
   I will tell you something. I remember well when my kids were in elementary school and my son had a teacher for whom I didn't particularly care. I was at a meeting with some friends. I complained about the teacher. And, surprisingly, another one of my friends said: You do not like that teacher? That is the best teacher my child has ever had. Why? Because that teacher didn't connect with my son but did connect with her son. Different kids learn different ways. Different kids connect with different adults. A teacher may do really well with one child and not well with another. 
   Tell me, how are we going to pick which teacher gets the merit pay? By the parents who like the teacher the best? By 
   the teacher who is the toughest, who may do well for some kids but not well for others? By the teacher who does the most testing in their classrooms? By the teacher who passes a test, maybe? 
   I can tell you this. I have had teachers in my own life and in my kids' lives who were brilliant but who had no way of communicating with the kids they were teaching or how to teach what they held in their own head. 
   I ask my colleagues, and I ask those who are listening, how would you pick which one of your very own teachers or which one of your kids' teachers should receive merit pay? Do you think you can do a fair job? 
   That is what we are doing in this amendment we are debating today. Somebody is going to have to pick. Somebody is going to have to choose that curriculum. Instead of encouraging teachers to work together, whatever that criterion is which some principal decides is going to be how they choose a teacher to get merit pay is going to create disincentives in their own building and antagonism in their own building. I don't think that is what we need to be encouraging. 
   I think we need to address the issue of getting the best and brightest teachers in our classrooms. We do not pay any teacher enough, I am here to tell you, particularly those teachers who are in our toughest schools, who have the kids with 99-percent-free and reduced lunches in their elementary schools. I have been in those schools--kids who come and hear 70 different languages in one school district, kids who come to school who have not even lived in a home, or in the same home for more than several weeks, kids who come to school whose parents may not have come home last night, who may not have eaten last night, who have seen tremendous difficulties in their own lives. 
   We need to make sure those kids get a good teacher. But those are incredibly difficult challenges, and those are the incredibly difficult classrooms. 
   If we are going to provide extra pay for a couple of teachers only, I say let's give it to those teachers who are teaching in the most difficult circumstances. We should be giving them combat pay for their difficult circumstances. Certainly, I will tell you that those teachers who are in those classrooms are not likely to be the ones who get merit pay if it is based on any kind of teacher testing, or testing of their students, because they have the toughest kids in their classrooms. 
   Merit pay, if you do it on testing, rewards those teachers whose kids come to school ready to learn, whose parents are there helping them, and who come from the communities that have the resources in those schools. 
   Let's be very careful about what we are promoting. Let's be sure that we tell kids in our high schools and colleges that we want them to teach; we need them to teach. We know we need the best and the brightest in our classrooms, we know we need teachers who are professionals, and we know we must reward them. 
   I know that doesn't address the question my colleagues brought out about: What about those poor teachers? What about those teachers who aren't qualified? 
   I can tell you what we are asking teachers to do today is tremendously different from what we asked teachers to do 10, 20, or 30 years ago. 
   If you got your teaching degree back in 1972 and you are teaching in a classroom today, I assure you that no one in your college taught you how to use a computer. No one taught you how to develop your curriculum to use technology. No one thought you would need the math skills our students need today. No one thought you would be teaching in a classroom with many different languages or cultures. No one thought you would have the discipline problems you have. 
   Let's take those teachers who got their degree back in 1970, 1975, or 1980 and give them the professional development to get the skills they need in today's classrooms. 
   I have talked to teachers who feel extremely frustrated. They tell me if I were in a private business and the requirements had changed as dramatically as our public schools had in the last 30 years, they would have sent me to professional development. 
   We lack the resources and haven't provided the resources in our public education system to give our teachers the professional development they need. Let's not condemn them for that now. Let's do what is right and help provide professional development for our teachers in a way that is constructive so we can keep people who want to be in the classroom but have not been able to keep up. 
   I think we can revise some of the systems of tenure; many districts have  done that. I think that is a good way to proceed. 
   It is pretty darn frustrating to be a teacher today. They listen to the debate on the Senate floor and they hear about all the horrible teachers who cannot pass tests. These are people with college degrees who chose to be in our classrooms with our young kids. These are people who we should be supporting. We should be supporting them with incentives to be in the teaching profession. We should support them with quality pay. When teachers work for $23,000 a year and are told they have to go back and pay for a test to stay in this profession, or pay to go back to school, how do they do that? I don't know how they do that. I don't know how a single mom with a couple of kids who is teaching and earning $23,000 or $25,000 a year would ever be able to continue to be in our classroom, even if she were in the best classroom, if we required her to go back to school to take tests. 
   There is one problem with this underlying amendment I have not mentioned, and I don't think anybody has. There is no money here. It requires testing, and there is no money. That money will have to come from somewhere in the districts. The districts will not have the money, and likely they will require the teachers themselves to pay for it. That has been the practice in the past. 
   I understand the motive behind the slogan. I understand the desire to tell the good teachers in our classrooms that we appreciate the work they are doing. However, I think we should reward all teachers with better salaries. I think we should provide better training for teachers, more professional development for our teachers, give them the skills they need. If we want to come back and say we have done everything for these teachers to give them the best skills and they still don't make the grade, then there is something to say about this underlying amendment. We haven't done that yet. We have left our teachers behind. As a result, we have left our students behind. 
   In closing, there are tremendously good people in our schools today who are trying their best and working very hard. I think they deserve the most accolades we can give them. We should not be denigrating them. 
   We do have some excellent ways of rewarding good teachers today. On my staff, I have a woman named Ann Ifekwunigwe, an Albert Einstein Distinguished Educator. She has been with me on my staff as a fellow for the last year and has done an outstanding job. She is actually an elementary schoolteacher from the Los Angeles Unified School District. She is a great example of what we are already doing. Ann worked very hard and received her national board teacher certificate in California. Once you have done that in California, teachers then get a 15-percent salary increase and a $10,000 bonus. 
   There are ways under current law to encourage and help pave the way for teachers who want to get additional training which benefits all of our students. We should encourage those. I don't think we should be just using a slogan of merit pay, saying we will pick a couple of teachers out of our schools and tell them they are better than the rest of the teachers, without understanding the consequences of what may happen. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, classrooms across America are less crowded today than they were a year ago, because this Congress made a commitment to hiring new teachers to reduce classroom overcrowding. 
   The progress has been overwhelming. Today, 1.7 million students are in less crowded classrooms--where they can learn the basics in a disciplined environment. 
   That is the type of progress we should continue. Unfortunately, this Republican bill abandons our commitment to helping students learn in less crowded classrooms. 
   At a time when we should be ensuring that every student can benefit from an uncrowded classroom, this Republican bill makes no guarantee that smaller classes will become a reality. 
   That is why I am on the floor today--to make sure that no student is stuck in an overcrowded classroom in grades 1-3. 
   I am offering an amendment which would authorize the class size reduction program in the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. 
   As a former teacher, I can tell you, it really makes a difference if you have 18 kids in a classroom instead of 35--parents know it, teachers know it, and students know it. By working together over the past 2 years, we have been able to bring real results to students. 
   With the first year of class size reduction funding, we have been able to hire 29,000 teachers across the country. Approximately 1.7 million students across the country are learning in classrooms that are less crowded than they were the year before. The average class size has been reduced by more than five students in the grades where these funds have been concentrated. 
   Forty-two percent of the teachers hired are teaching first grade. In these schools, the average class size fell from approximately 23 to 17 students, 23 percent of the teachers are in 2nd grade, and 24 percent are in third grade. In both of these grades, the average class size, where these funds were used, dropped from 23 to 18 students. In addition, districts are using approximately 8 percent of this money to support professional development so we can have teachers of the highest quality. 
   Let me take a moment to share a list of some of the benefits of class size reduction. Class size reduction produces better student achievement, something every Senator has been out here to say they support. It brings about fewer discipline problems. When there are fewer kids in your classroom you can maintain discipline; there is more individual attention, better parent-teacher communication--an essential to a  child's education--and dramatic results for poor and minority students. 
   Those are some of the ways smaller classes help students reach their potential. Those are the results we should be giving all students in the early grades. But today, there are still too many students in overcrowded classrooms. 
   Today, the average classroom in grades 1-3 has 22 students in it, students who are fighting for the time and attention of just one teacher, students who might not get their questions answered because their classmates are creating disruptions, students who aren't learning the basics. 
   Those students would be helped dramatically if we gave them a less crowded classroom with a fully-qualified, caring teacher. 
   Go out into your local school districts and talk to any teachers, and I believe they will tell you classes are overcrowded. It is not easy for local school districts to hire teachers on their own. 
   Believe me--I served on a local school board. This is one area where the Federal partnership really makes a dramatic difference for students. 
   I understand, as a former school board member, the pressure the school boards and others involved with the budget face in allocating scarce resources. 
   The pressure on how to spend these funds are immense, and in most district budgets, there is not money to reduce class size. 
   The Federal funds for the purpose of reducing class size are incredibly important for supplementing district budget to address the class size. 
   Let me share an example of how one of the districts in my State is using these funds. The Tacoma School District in Washington State received a class size reduction grant of a little over $1 million, and the district started a program called ``Great Start.'' That's one of the best things about this program. School districts can use this money to meet the unique challenges their students face. We know that not every school district is the same. We know that some schools need more help hiring teachers, and others need more help training teachers. That is why this program that we created 2 years ago is flexible. 
   So the educators in Tacoma decided they would focus the money on first grade. And, they decided that--in addition to reducing over-crowded classrooms--they were going to make sure that those new teachers had the best strategies for helping students. They set clear goals. For example, they set the goal that every student be able to read and write by the spring of their first grade year. They hired an additional 20 fully-qualified new teachers. And the difference has been dramatic. 
   Today, as a result of this program, those classrooms have an average of just 16 students. Those students are now better able to learn the basics with fewer discipline problems. 
   I am proud to say I have visited schools in Tacoma. I have seen the great strides those dedicated educators are making. But do not take my word for it. Listen to what one of the teachers wrote to me. 
   I received this letter from Rachel Lovejoy, a first grade teacher at Whittier Elementary School in Tacoma. 
   She writes:  
   I knew first graders could make great gains, and this year they are.  
   Rachel is the type of teacher who goes out and visits every child's home in August before the school year begins. She meets their family and learns about that student's unique needs and challenges. 
   As Rachel told me:  
   With 16 families, I can fit the visits into my room preparation with greater ease. What a great start to building that family atmosphere in my class.  
   Rachel tells me that because she has fewer students in each class she is better able to keep track of how each student is progressing. 
   Rachel also says there are fewer discipline problems in her classroom today:  
   It is much easier to build a familial, caring community in the classroom with fewer children.  
   Rachel knows what makes a difference in the classroom, and she has a message for all of us about reducing class size:  
   The research is there. Accept no excuses. Gives us lower class size and training, and let us do what we do best ..... teach.  
   That is what we should be doing and that is what the amendment I am offering today does. It shows teachers like Rachel that we will stand with them and help them create effective classrooms. 
   I was fortunate to receive a letter from Lori Wegner--the parent of one of the students in Rachel Lovejoy's classroom. She writes:  
   With 16 children, Rachel is able to interact with each child on an individual basis throughout each day. Rachel is able to go above and beyond the basic requirements for testing the students' achievements and focus on each child's development in a way that is appropriate to the individual child.  
   Lori closes her letter to me by saying:  
   Please give our teachers the opportunity to facilitate the development of each individual student to their fullest potential during these critical years of learning.  
   Not only do the parents and teachers in my community tell me it works, but national research proves smaller class size helps students learn the basics in a disciplined environment. 
   A study conducted in Tennessee in 1989, known as the STAR Study, compared the performance of students in grades K-3 in small and regular-sized classes. This important study found that students in small classes--those with 13 to 17 students--significantly outperformed other students in math and reading. The STAR study found that students benefitted from smaller classes at all grade levels and across all geographic areas. 
   The study found that students in small classes have better high school graduation rates, higher grade point averages, and they are more inclined to pursue higher education. 
   I repeat, students who are in smaller class sizes in first, second, and third grade have higher graduation rates, higher grade point averages, and are more inclined to go on to higher education. Isn't that what all of us want? 
   According to research conducted by Princeton University economist, Dr. Alan Kruger, students who attended small classes were more likely to take ACT or SAT college entrance exams, and that was particularly true for African American students. 
   According to Dr. Kruger:  
   Attendance in small classes appears to have cut the black-white gap in the probability of taking a college-entrance exam by more than half.  
   Three other researchers at two different institutions of higher education found that STAR students who attended small classes in grades K-3 were between 6 and 13 months ahead of their regular class peers in math, reading, and science in each of grades 4, 6, and 8. 
   In yet another part of the country, a different class-size reduction study reached similar conclusions. The Wisconsin SAGE Study--Student Achievement Guarantee in Education--findings from 1996 thru 1999 consistently proved that smaller classes result in significantly greater student achievement. 
   Class-size reduction programs in the SAGE study resulted in increased attention to individual students. This produced three main benefits: 
   No. 1, fewer discipline problems and more instruction, 
   No. 2, more knowledge of students, and No. 3, more teacher enthusiasm for teaching. 
   The Wisconsin study also found that in smaller classes, teachers were able to identify the learning problems of individual students more quickly. 
   As one teacher participant in the SAGE class-size reduction study said:  
   If a child is having problems, you can see it right away. You can take care of it then. It works a lot better for the children.  
   Parents of children in smaller classes notice the difference as well. The mother of a child who moved from a class of 23 students to a class of 15 students discovered that--she wrote this to me:  
   The smaller class makes it possible for the teacher to get to know the kids a lot faster, so they can assess their strengths and weaknesses right away and start working from those points right away.  
   Discipline problems were also greatly reduced in smaller classes. One teacher said:  
   In a class of thirty students, you're always redirecting, redirecting--spending most of your time redirecting and disciplining kids where you're not getting as much instructional time in.   
   Those are not my words, they are hers. 
   By contrast, another teacher said:  
   Having 15 [students], I'm so close to them. Generally, I don't have to say a thing; I just look at them and they shape up and get back to work ..... So I don't spend a lot of time with discipline anymore.  
   The empirical support for smaller class size is compelling. Smaller classes in SAGE schools produced high levels of classroom efficiency; a positive classroom atmosphere; expansive learning opportunities; and enthusiasm and achievement among both students and teachers. The SAGE study concluded that the main effect of smaller class size was greater student success in school. 
   Today we have the opportunity to authorize the class-size reduction program in this bill and ensure we do not abandon our school districts in their efforts to reduce class size, which have been so successful. 
   It is our opportunity to make a commitment to improving America's public schools. 
   I am offering this class-size reduction amendment to give Members of the Senate the opportunity to show parents, teachers and students that we understand that it's important to reduce the class size. 
   My class size amendment will continue the progress we have made over the past 2 years in dedicating funding to class-size reduction. It will bring us to a total of more than 43,000 fully qualified teachers nationwide. 
   Here are the specifics of my amendment: 
   This amendment would use $1.75 billion to reduce class size, particularly in the early grades, grades 1 through 3, using fully qualified teachers to improve educational achievement for regular and special needs children. 
   It targets the money where it is needed within states. 
   Within States, 99 percent of the funds will be disbursed directly to local school districts on a formula which is 80 percent need-based, and 20 percent enrollment-based. 
   Small school districts that alone may not generate enough Federal funding to pay for a starting teacher's salary may combine funds with other dollars to pay the salary of a full or part-time teacher or use the funds on professional development related to class size. 
   This amendment ensures local decision-making. 
   Each school district board makes all decisions about hiring and training new teachers. They decide what their needs are. They decide how many teachers they want to hire. They decide which classrooms to focus their efforts on. They decide what goals they want those students to reach. It is local decision making. 
   This amendment promotes teacher quality. 
   Up to 25 percent of the funds may be used to test new teachers, or to provide professional development to new and current teachers of regular and special needs children. 
   The program ensures that all teachers are fully qualified. 
   School districts hire State certified teachers so students learn from fully trained professionals. 
   This amendment is flexible. 
   Any school district that has already reduced class size in the early grades to 18 or fewer children may use funds to further reduce class sizes in the early grades; reduce class size in kindergarten or other grades; or carry out activities to improve teacher quality, including professional development. 
   The flexibility for these funds is seen throughout my State. 
   In Washington, the North Thurston school district is using all of their funds to hire teachers to reduce class size. At the same time, the Pomeroy school district, which is a rural district in eastern Washington, was able to use 100% of their funds to improve teacher quality through professional development. The Seattle school district even used a portion of their funding to recruit new teachers. 
   The Class-Size Program is simple and efficient. School districts fill out a one-page form, which is available on-line. Here is a copy of the one-page form from my State. 
   This is a copy. We hear from the other side about bureaucracy and paperwork. This is an example of how targeted Federal funding for a program really works. This is a one-page form. School districts fill it out, and they get the money. It is at their request. They do not have to ask for the money, but if they do, they fill out a one-page form and the money is available to them. 
   Teachers have told me, by the way, they have never seen money move so quickly from Congress to the classroom as they have seen with these class-size reduction funds. 
   Linda McGeachy in the Vancouver school district, recently commented, ``The language if very clear, applying was very easy, and there funds really work to support classroom teachers.'' 
   Finally, this amendment ensures accountability. In Addition, the language clarifies that the funds are supplementary, and cannot replace current spending on teachers or teacher salaries. Accountability is assured by requiring school districts to send a ``report card'' in understandable language to their local community--including information about how achievement has improved as a result of reducing class size. 
   Before I close, I just want to make one final point. This class size program was a great idea when we passed it 2 years ago, and I was especially pleased that we had the support of so many of my colleagues from the other side of the aisle. 
   In fact, I have a press release from the Republican Policy Committee which was put out on October 20, 1998. It listed class size as one of the accomplishments the Republican Party had at that time. It says, ``Teacher quality initiative cleared by the President,'' and it lists class-size reduction funding as one of the major accomplishments during the 105th Congress. So this was a bipartisan proposal. 
   Throughout the last 2 years, we have worked together to make sure the language works for everyone involved. 
   We have seen the results come in. Mr. President, 1.7 million students have benefited from this policy. That really is why I find it so surprising that in this underlying Republican bill we back away from that commitment that 2 years ago we were touting as the way to go and as an accomplishment for both sides. 
   I am offering this amendment today to give both the Democrats and the Republicans an opportunity to show that they care about the students in America's classrooms and to keep that commitment we made 2 years ago. 
   Parents, teachers, and students across America want students to be in classes that are not crowded. Working together over the past 2 years, we have been able to help 1.7 million students learn the basics with fewer discipline problems. The results are in. Smaller classes are making a positive difference. The research proves it. Parents, teachers, and students have seen the results. We should be committed to continuing that effort and not abandoning it in the underlying bill. 
   That is why I am offering this amendment today, to make sure we continue the progress in reducing class size. Our children deserve the best. America deserves the best. This amendment gives it to them. I urge my colleagues to support it. 
   Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.

   Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, we came together several years ago in a bipartisan manner, both sides of the Senate, Republican and Democrat, and said we have made a great accomplishment, we have targeted Federal funds to a program that we know will work, reducing class size. Studies show it, from the Educational Testing Service in 1997 to the Star study in 1989, to the Wisconsin State study, to the New York study which I will read to you very quickly. A teacher said:  
   Now that I have seen the difference a small class makes, I don't want to go back to being a policeman.   
   I think that says it for all of us. We know in first, second, and third grades, if we reduce the class sizes, our kids will learn the basics--math, reading, and science--that they will go on to college, there will be fewer discipline problems, and we will have accomplished something great. 
   Senator HARKIN has been out in his State, as many of us have, in the classrooms that are a direct recipient of our class size money. I challenge my colleagues to do the same because when you do, you can then walk away and say: I did something realistic and I can see it in the faces of these kids. 
   We have the opportunity now to continue that program, and I urge this amendment's adoption.

And we, again, asked the author of this amendment in committee if the title I portability funds could be used for private education institutions, and his answer was yes. This amendment doesn't fix that. I am glad it fixes the first part of it, but it doesn't--and the Senator can respond--fix the portability.

   Mrs. MURRAY. If the Senator will yield for one other point, because I have continually heard that with title I funds, for over 35 years kids have not increased their abilities, and test scores don't show that, it is my understanding that we test title I students, or analyze their performances, and as kids do better, they move out of the program. So each year, we have new kids coming into the program who need the extra services for reading, writing, and basic instruction. So we are not testing the same kids year after year. When we hear the comments that student achievement has not increased under title I, we essentially haven't been testing the same group of students, and we cannot show that because they have moved out and we are testing new kids. Am I correct?

   Mrs. MURRAY. I thank the Senator from Massachusetts. I don't think any of us disagree with the goal of reducing by 10 percent over 5 years the term of performance agreements--the difference between the highest and lowest achieving students. But I think to rhetorically say that we can do it through a test is very difficult. I think we all want students to achieve better. Here on the Democratic side, we believe that by providing high-quality teachers and class sizes that are reduced, where a teacher has time to teach math and English, where we are in classrooms and where students can actually learn and they are not there in overcoats because there is no heating, or there are holes in the roof, and that we continue to put Federal resources into programs that have been shown to work those achievement gaps will decrease. I hope our colleagues understand this as we move forward. I thank the Senator from Massachusetts for yielding.

   Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I congratulate the Senator from Maine also for working on this issue. 
   My amendment, I think, fixes one problem with which many of us were concerned. However, regarding the title I portability funds in the bill, I am reading the language of the bill on page 127. It says:  
   Subparagraph (b): Provided by the schools directly or through the provision of supplemental education services with any governmental or nongovernmental agency, school, post-secondary educational institution, or other entity, including a private organization or business.  
   The language in the bill allows title I portability funds to go to a public or private school. 
   In committee, we asked if it could go to a private school. We didn't use the word ``vouchers.'' We said: Could this portability money go to a private school? The answer is yes. That is what the language does. The amendment before us fixes the Straight A's question, but it does not fix title I portability.

   Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to thank our minority leader, Senator TOM DASCHLE, for the tremendous effort he has made in helping us craft the Democratic alternative to the underlying bill that we are considering today, the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. This amendment the minority leader has put forward is going to make very important corrections to the Republican bill that will help all students in this country and their schools get the help they really need. 
   On Monday on the Senate floor, I, along with a lot of my colleagues on this side, outlined the many ways that this Republican bill is going to hurt our students. I outlined our positive agenda that will help all students reach their potential by investing in the things we know work. 
   Today, I have come back to the Senate floor to support this alternative which sets the right priorities for our students. This is a positive agenda for making improvements to the role the Federal Government plays in helping our local districts provide education. 
   Across this country, schools are making remarkable progress, but none of us can remain satisfied with the status quo. 
   As Americans, we believe every child should be able to meet high standards and reach his or her full potential. This debate in this Senate is our chance--our only chance, perhaps in 6 years--to make sure every child has the tools to succeed. 
   As a parent, as someone who has fought for our students on the PTA, as a school board member, I have seen what works in our schools. Parents and educators have told me we need to invest in smaller class sizes. We need to invest in teacher quality. We need to help to have more parental involvement in our schools. We need to invest in safe and modern schools for all of our kids. Those are proven strategies that are transforming schools across the country. We should invest in those powerful approaches. 
   Unfortunately, the Republican proposal before us goes in the exact opposite direction. Instead of making a commitment to what works, and to what we know works, it experiments with things that have no record of producing results for students. 
   Today, surprisingly, the Federal Government only provides 7 percent of all education funding. But those dollars are very importantly targeted to help America's most vulnerable students meet their critical needs. It is a responsible, accountable way to meet the needs in America's classrooms. 
   The Republican approach would take the things that are working and turn them into a block grant. Their block grant does not go to the classroom. It goes to State legislatures and adds a new layer of bureaucracy between the education dollars and the students who are so important. 
   The Republican approach puts all of its faith in block grants. I am here to tell you that students will lose out because, as I have said before, a block grant cannot teach a single child to read. A block grant cannot teach a single child the basics. But investing in teacher quality and reducing our class  sizes can help teach children the basics. That is what we should be doing in the Senate. 
   The Republican block grant proposal is a reckless, giant step backwards. First of all, the Republican bill is going to hurt disadvantaged students. Today, education dollars are targeted at the Federal level to America's most vulnerable students, ensuring that children who are homeless or children of migrant workers get the resources they need. They travel from school to school, from State to State; and we need to make sure, no matter what school or State they are in, they get the help they need. Under block grants, there would be no assurance that the education dollars intended for these very vulnerable students will actually go to those vulnerable students. 
   Educationally disadvantaged students have very few advocates. Believe me, as a former school board member, I know they do not show up at school board meetings. They do not show up in State legislatures. They certainly do not travel here to the Congress to stand up for the programs that serve their children. We have the responsibility to do that for them. By eliminating the targeting that helps poor students, block grants would simply cut the lifelines that run to disadvantaged students. We cannot let that happen. 
   Secondly, block grants reduce accountability. Under block grants, we do not know where our tax dollars are going. We will not know if that money is being used for critical needs. We will not know if public taxpayer dollars are staying in our public schools. 
   Block grants have little or no accountability for student 
   achievement. In this bill, we let 3 to 5 years pass before any accountability kicks in. We are going to lose kids in that amount of time. The Republican bill simply is a 3-year experiment that breaks our commitment to the things we know work, and it risks having students fall behind. Under the current bill, block grants would even allow public taxpayer dollars to be used for private schools. 
   The amendment that was previously offered supposedly fixes that, but it does not fix the fact that, under the title I portability requirements, public tax dollars will still be able to be used in private schools. 
   Finally, block grants mean less money for the classroom. Pure and simple, block grants will mean less money from the Federal Government to our classrooms. 
   By the way, block grants are not new. They do have a history here. That history shows us, very clearly, that when a specific program is turned into a block grant, inevitably the funding will get cut. 
   For example, an education program that we call title VI, which funds innovative education efforts, was turned into a block grant in 1982. Guess what happened between 1982 and 1999. The funding for that program was cut in half. 
   The effects of putting our education budget today into a block grant would be felt in every school across this country. We would see more overcrowded classrooms with fewer resources dedicated to improving teacher quality. That will be the result of block grants. 
   The Republican agenda is made up of block grants and vouchers, cutting lifelines to vulnerable students, having less money for our classrooms, and less accountability for taxpayers. 
   There is no reason to experiment with block grants and risk leaving students behind. We know how to improve education, and we should be doing that on the Senate floor. That is why I support the Democratic alternative that is now before the Senate. 
   We believe we must keep our commitment to vulnerable students. We believe we should keep our schools accountable. We believe we should not let block grants shortchange students. That is why we are fighting these block grants and standing up for the strategies that make a positive difference in the classroom. That is why we are working very hard to pass this Democratic alternative. 
   This alternative makes a real commitment to reducing classroom overcrowding. It keeps our commitment to help local school districts hire 100,000 new teachers to reduce classroom overcrowding, an approach that we know works--parents know it works, teachers know it works. Studies are showing that reducing class size in the first, second, and third grades makes a difference in our student's ability to read, to write, and to reduce discipline problems in our classrooms. That is in the Democratic alternative. 
   Over the past 2 years, Congress has provided more than $2.5 billion for the specific purpose of recruiting, hiring, and training teachers to reduce class size. Unfortunately, the underlying Republican bill walks away from that commitment. The Democratic substitute will authorize the Class Size Reduction Program, and provide $1.75 billion to help districts hire new, fully qualified teachers. 
   In addition to keeping that commitment, this alternative will address the need for a qualified teacher in every 
   classroom. I assure you, when they send their child off to school on the first day of school in September, every parent wants to know two things: how many kids are in their classroom, and who is their teacher? 
   Why do parents ask those questions? Because they know if their child is in a classroom that is small enough, where they get individual attention, and if they have the best teacher, that child is going to learn. 
   We want to make sure every child has a qualified teacher in their classroom. This Democratic alternative makes a move in the right direction. 
   The amendment will hold schools accountable for better student performance. It will expand and strengthen afterschool opportunities for students, which Senator BOXER has been so strong on, knowing that it makes a difference in the educational lives of thousands of students across this country. 
   We will repair and modernize America's aging schools. I can't tell you how many times I have been in a school where we have seen kids with coats on because the heat didn't work, where water was dripping through the classrooms, where they were in portables. We send first, second, and third graders out across schools to use restrooms because there isn't any running water in their building. We believe our children can learn if we pay attention to what they are learning in. 
   Our underlying Democratic alternative increases parental involvement. Every parent knows intuitively if they participate with their child in their school, their child will learn better. We make sure that happens in the Democratic alternative. 
   Finally, we work to close the digital divide. As Senator MIKULSKI so eloquently speaks about, we have to make sure every child is on the right side of the digital divide. This Democratic alternative makes that happen. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this alternative. Clearly, the Republican proposal before us will leave students behind. By passing this amendment, we will show parents, teachers, and students across the country that we understand the challenges they face, and that we are going to be good partners at the Federal level to make sure all of our kids, no matter who they are or from where they come, will have the opportunity to reach their full potential. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, today we are beginning a vital education debate. It is a debate in which every student, educator, and parent has a stake. Schools across America are making progress, but we cannot be satisfied with the status quo. We need to build on that progress. 
   As we begin this debate, I am optimistic. We have the opportunity to help students across our country. We have the opportunity to invest in things we know work and to make sure every student can reach high standards. 
   I am optimistic, but I am also realistic about the way the majority has handled education this year. While I thank Chairman JEFFORDS for his genuine continued efforts to keep this a bipartisan process, I have to be realistic because, in the end, this has been a sharply partisan process, and the bill before us proves just that. 
   In committee, I worked with my Democratic colleagues to improve this bill, to make sure we kept our commitment to reduce overcrowded classrooms and to make sure that vulnerable students were protected. Unfortunately, my amendments, along with most of the Democratic amendments, were defeated on party-line votes. As a result, this bill is a flawed bill, and it will hurt students, but one would never know it by listening to its authors. I urge my colleagues and everyone who cares about public education to listen carefully to what you hear the Republicans say in this debate and also to listen for what you do not hear them say. 
   The rhetoric the proponents of this bill are using does not match the reality of the bill. First, they talk about local control, even though this bill reduces the control of local educators by giving all the choices to State bureaucracies. They will talk about local control, even though their bill adds an extra level of bureaucracy. 
   Next, they will talk about flexibility and suggest that Federal dollars are not flexible, but education dollars, such as the title I program, today--right now--give local educators great flexibility. In fact, one could walk into a dozen title I schools and no two schools will be doing the same thing with that money because this program today is flexible. Decisions at the school and district level are being made today. 
   We will hear them talk about accountability, even though their bill would experiment with students' futures for 3 years before there is any measure of accountability. That is 3 full years where kids will fall behind. 
   Finally, they talk about helping poor students, even though their bill eliminates--eliminates--the guaranteed funding those students rely on today. My colleagues will hear them talk about things that are much different from what their bill actually does. Their rhetoric does not meet the reality of this bill. 
   Just as important, there are many things my colleagues will not hear them say. They will not talk about funding cuts, but as history has shown, when specific programs are combined into a block grant, they end up with fewer resources. Block grants will mean fewer dollars for the classrooms next year. 
   They will not talk about how their bill will cut the lifelines that target funding to students who are homeless or neglected or of migrant workers. 
   They will not talk about how their bill will let public taxpayer dollars be diverted to private and religious schools. 
   They will not talk about those things, but those are the consequences of this bill. Their bill goes in the wrong direction, and students are going to lose out. 
   Instead of making sure that every student has a chance to reach high standards, the Republican proposal before us makes it easier for kids to be left behind. Instead of ensuring we reduce class size, the Republican proposal abandons our national commitment to give students less crowded classrooms. 
   Instead of making a national commitment to improve teacher quality, the Republican proposal fails to provide funding for professional development. 
   Instead of ensuring that we invest in the things we know work, the Republican proposal abandons accountability, writes a blank check to State legislatures, and hopes for the best. 
   That is not a responsible education policy. That is throwing their hands up in the air and walking away from proven methods for helping our students achieve. The Republican proposal goes in the wrong direction, and it will leave students behind. 
   I have been traveling around the State of Washington meeting with parents, students, and educators. I have visited high-poverty title I schools, and I have visited school districts large and small. As I have been able to discuss how these policies will actually affect what is happening in the classrooms, almost every single local educator has urged me to fight this approach because they know it will hurt their students.  
   I have come to the Senate floor today to show the American people what is at stake because they have a clear choice on how to improve education. On the one hand, we have Democrats who know that, while some schools are making great strides, we cannot be satisfied with the status quo. We believe the way to improve public schools is to invest in the things we know work, the things that are proven to help kids learn the basics in a safe, disciplined environment. 
   We believe we should make a commitment to reducing class size by hiring more teachers, improving teacher quality, making sure we have safe and modern school facilities, and making sure children have safe educational opportunities after school. 
   Educators, parents, and students themselves have told us these are the programs that make a difference in their classrooms, and that is why we want to make sure there are specific dollars behind those programs. That is what the Democrats are offering. 
   Republicans go in the exact opposite direction. They say we should have no priorities. They do not want to make any commitment to the programs we know work. They do not want to make sure every student in every part of this country can benefit from smaller class sizes and improved teacher quality. It is as if Republicans have forgotten the history of our national education policy, and by ignoring that history, they are making the same mistakes again and moving us back to a time when there was less equality in education. 
   One of the reasons this legislation was passed in 1965 was to ensure that every single child had great educational opportunities. Unfortunately, before the Federal Government became a partner in education, too many young people did not get the educational resources they deserved. That is why, in 1965, the Congress and the President enacted this monumental legislation, the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, which we are debating today, to focus resources on the students who were left behind and to help us set and meet national priorities. 
   We are making progress in improving America's schools. More students are staying in school and taking challenging courses today. SAT and ACT scores are up, dropout rates are lower today than they were 20 years ago, and college attendance is at an all-time high, and is increasing for all students, especially minorities. 
   We are making progress but we can't be satisfied with the status quo. But today, some in Congress want to risk letting vulnerable students fall through the cracks. 
   So as we reauthorize this legislation, we must stay true to its most basic principle--that no child is left behind. But as we worked in committee on this legislation, I watched as the majority moved away--far away--from that very basic principle. 
   I would like to mention that--according the Republicans--the Straight A's part of their bill is based on the policies of one State. And guess which Sate it is. It is Texas. 
   Now I happen to like the State of Texas, and I know Texas educators are as good as any in America. But there is only so much they can do with the bad policies they have been given. 
   After all, Texas ranks 45th in SAT scores. That is at the bottom of the pack. In Texas, minorities are twice as likely to drop out of school as white students. Texas schools have some of the Nation's highest dropout rates--which, by the way, makes the test scores of the remaining students look higher. Texas, after all, is a State that doesn't even require kindergarten. A recent Washington Post article noted that many education experts have concluded the ``Texas Miracle'' is more of a mirage. 
   We should base our national education policy on the things that we know work around the country--drawing success stories from educational innovators in every corner of the Nation. And we can do better than the one state the Republicans chose to highlight with this bill. 
   I would like to spend a few minutes talking about what these Republican block grants will mean for students because block grants could hurt America's most vulnerable students. 
   Today, many Federal education dollars are targeted to the students who need them the most. This ensures that money intended for poor students actually goes to poor students. It is a responsible, accountable way to meet the specific needs of students who would otherwise likely be left behind. 
   But the block grant proposal before us would allow those dollars to be used for any educational purpose--completely abandoning the targeting that ensures poor students get the help they need. 
   Recently, here on the Senate floor, one of my colleagues described the requirements that Federal dollars can only be used for specific purposes--as ``strings.'' 
   Let me read you his entire quote, He said:  
   On the other side of the aisle, they want to have a string running from every desk out to every classroom in America; 30,000 strings running off the desks, and pull a string here and there so every classroom in America has to fall into exactly what we outline in Congress.  
   My colleague calls the targeting of these dollars ``strings.'' I served on a local school board. I think it is a good thing that hard-earned taxpayers dollars intended for a specific purpose actually go to that specific purpose. It is responsible, and it is accountable. 
   Now I do agree that some Federal programs require too much paperwork and that we can't accept the status quo in education--but the overall idea that money intended for kids in need actually goes to kids in need is vital. 
   Let me give you an example. Recently, my office received a letter from Brenda Pessin. She directs a program that helps students who are migrant workers. These students rely on Federal education dollars targeted to meet their needs. Ms. Pessin--as director of the ESTRELLA program of the Illinois Migrant Council, wrote to me:  
   After many years of working on the program, I can say without question that it is truly a lifeline for migrant children and their families. There is simply no way that the essential services provided by the program to this special population--with such unique needs--will be continued under a block grant.  
   My colleague calls them ``strings.'' But according to Brenda Pessin--who sees every day how these programs help vulnerable students--they are ``lifelines.'' I am inclined to listen to Ms. Pessin. 
   I want everyone to understand what these proposed block grants would do. They would cut the lifelines to vulnerable students. 
   Let me say that again. Block grants would cut the lifelines to vulnerable students. 
   If you look at this chart, shown here is a targeted Federal education dollar. It is surrounded by some of the services it guarantees for vulnerable students. 
   Shown here is an uncrowded classroom. 
   Shown here is transportation so homeless students can get to school. 
   Shown here is money targeted for technology training. 
   Shown here is extra time and attention from a qualified teacher. 
   And over on this side of the chart is shown two real students who depend on these programs and who represent hundreds of thousands of other students. 
   Shown up on top of the chart is Nikki. Nikki is an 8th grade student in Pennsylvania who is homeless. She is normally an A and B student but she was falling behind in two classes and at risk of failing 8th grade. 
   Furtunately, today we have a lifeline--shown right here on the chart--going to homeless students. It is called the Education for Homeless Children and Youth program. It is money the Federal Government sends to States with the requirement that it be used to help homeless students. This program provided the funding Nikki needed to get extra help in the classroom and to buy the school supplies her family couldn't afford. You know what. Today she is doing much better in school. 
   Nikki is not alone. There are between 600,000 and 1 million homeless students nationwide. Most States and localities provide no money for homeless education. In fact, currently the Federal Government only provides enough money to serve 37 percent of homeless students. 
   So right now we are not doing enough to help these vulnerable students, but at least today we know that the dollars targeted to homeless students are homeless students.  
   If that targeting was taken away--and that money could be used for anything else--who knows how students like Nikki would get help? 
   Block grants would eliminate the guarantee we make to Nikki right now. Now I am not suggesting that States would misuse the money--but wouldn't you rather keep our commitment to Nikki? 
   Wouldn't you rather know that--no matter what happens--the Nikki's of America won't be left behind? 
   We know that before we had a Federal commitment, homeless children were left behind. 
   That is why I am fighting to keep our commitment that money for homeless students should go to homeless students. 
   Block grants would cut this lifeline to Nikki and the more than half a million homeless students like her. 
   Down here on the chart is shown Ancelmo. Ancelmo is just finishing high school in the Yakima Valley in Washington State. When Ancelmo was growing up, his parents were migrant workers. They moved around several times a year in search of work, and Ancelmo had to change schools every time his family moved. Just as Ancelmo started to make a connection with a teacher, and began to feel comfortable with his classmates, he was moved away to another school, in another town--through no fault of his own. 
   Unfortunately, sitting in a classroom is not always an option for migrant students like Ancelmo. As they grow older, their families begin to rely on the work they can do. Many migrant students join their parents in the field--working long hours to help make ends meet. Students like Ancelmo are trapped. His family needed him in the field, but he needed to be in the classroom so he could get a good education and improve his life and his family's life. 
   Fortunately, today, we have a lifeline going to migrant students like Ancelmo. Thanks to the federally funded Migrant Education programs, Ancelmo could travel from town to town or State to State and his academic and immunization records followed him. 
   Thanks to Federal funding, many States have established a system of interstate collaboration to help migrant students meet the high academic standards. Without this collaboration, migrant children are in danger of falling further behind. 
   Thanks to federally funded Migrant Education programs, Ancelmo has been able to follow his dream of working with computers. He had to overcome a lot of barriers--like learning to speak English, and staying at school long hours to have access to a computer. But today--you know what?--Ancelmo has achieved his goal, and he serves as the computer technician for his entire school. Ancelmo hopes to go on to become a telecommunications specialist. 
   Thanks to federally funded Migrant education programs, teachers were able to work directly with Ancelmo and address his specific needs as a migrant student. He was not lost in the shuffle. Because of this attention to his specific needs, he learned quickly and gained confidence in his abilities. 
   Ancelmo is now a great asset to his community. He is a leader in church programs. He has served as captain of his football, baseball, basketball and soccer teams. He volunteers in the Big Brothers, Big Sisters program. He takes time to talk to children about staying away from drugs, and he spends his summers as a peer leader for other teens. 
   One of the reasons we need a national commitment to migrant students is because they move from town to town and State to State. I would hate to think of what would have happened to Ancelmo if his family had moved him to a State where there was no guaranteed funding for migrant education. That would have hurt not only Ancelmo, but the other students in his class who would be forced to do more with less. 
   Ancelmo's entire community would have lost out on his talent and leadership as well because there would not have been any guarantee that his schools would address his specific needs as a migrant student. He would have fallen through the cracks. 
   Ancelmo is not alone. there are 718,000 students nationwide who depend on the Migrant Education Program. 
   A block grant would eliminate the guarantee we make to students such as Ancelmo. Now, I am not suggesting that States would misuse the money, but wouldn't you rather keep a commitment to students like Ancelmo? 
   Wouldn't you rather know that no matter what happens, these students won't be left behind? 
   That's why I'm fighting to keep our commitment to vulnerable students. 
   Block grants would cut this lifeline to 718,000 students like Ancelmo. 
   Look at these kids. They are cut off from the lifelines that meet their specific needs. That's what happens to them when block grants are imposed on them. Their lifelines to vital services are cut, and they are more likely to fall through the cracks. 
   So at the heart of this education debate is a simple question: do you want to make sure that Federal dollars are guaranteed to go to the students who need them the most? Or do you want to take a chance? 
   Do you want to cut students' lifelines to success? 
   Unfortunately, some of my colleagues say those dollars should not be tied to specific programs, including these programs that make sure money gets to students who are homeless and migrant. 
   Some Members of the Senate would even let public school dollars be drained away into private schools. 
   Let me be clear: A block grant can't educate a single child. A block grant can't teach a child to read. A block grant can't help a single child learn the basics. 
   But a committed investment in the things we know work, such as improving teacher quality and reducing class size, those specific things can teach children to read. We should be investing in the things we know work, not experimenting with block grants. 
   We have a positive plan to invest in the things we know work. The first step is to make sure that disadvantaged students don't lose out. 
   The simple question is, is it worth keeping the guarantees to these students? I think the answer is clear. I think Nikki and Ancelmo would tell you: Don't cut the lifeline we depend on. 
   Unfortunately, students like Nikki and Ancelmo--and their parents--don't always show up at school board meetings. They don't show up in their State capital or here in Congress to say, Don't cut this program. So we've got to be their voice and speak out against the block grants that will cut their lifelines. 
   Mr. President, that is only one of the problems with the Republican proposal. Another major problem with block grants is they mean less money for the classroom. Right now, Republicans want you to believe that they will keep the same amount of money available for education. But when those dollars are combined into a block grant, we know they will be cut. 
   Block grants mean less money for the classroom. You see, block grants are not a new idea. They are an old and failed policy. One of the reasons block grants don't work is because they don't serve a specific purpose. And when there is not a clear purpose, it is hard to make progress toward a goal. 
   That is why education policy today is targeted. We have programs that are focused on poor students, on gifted students and on reducing class size. 
   But Republican block grants have no specific purpose. In effect, they're just a blank check. And the trickiest part about block grants is they have a history of shrinking. Here in Congress, we have many examples of programs that were turned into block grants. And once they were turned into block grants, they were squeezed and cut every year. 
   Let me give you an example. Title VI is an education program that funds innovative education programs including programs to increase local flexibility, reduce administrative burdens, and provide services for private school students. 
   In 1982, Congress provided about $708 million. But that year, Title VI was turned into a block grant and over time its budget was cut again and again. By 1999, funding for this program had been cut by 50 percent, chopped in half. That's fewer dollars for the classroom after it was turned into a block grant. 
   In contrast, other education programs that weren't turned into block  grants were increased, such as education technology and Title I. But this one, which was turned into a block grant, was squeezed. That's what we can expect out of block grants. 
   And the consequences of these block grants will be felt in classrooms across the country. Kids will get fewer resources. That means that classrooms across the country would be overcrowded. New schools won't be built, and teachers won't get the training they need. 
   Anyone who votes for a block grant is saying: I know that under block grants, students will end up with less money, and that's OK with me. 
   I'm here to say that is not OK. We can't let block grants be used to cut education funding. 
   Mr. President, in addition to cutting the lifelines to vulnerable students and cutting education funding, block grants would reduce accountability. 
   Parents, teachers and all taxpayers want to know where their hard-earned tax dollars are going. 
   Today, we know where Federal education dollars are going. And today, we know they are targeted to the students who need them most. The block grant proposal contained in the ESEA bill would eliminate that accountability, and I'm on the floor to say we must keep our education budget accountable. 
   Unfortunately, block grants provide no accountability for where education dollars are going. Block grants provide no accountability to ensure those dollars are targeted to our most vulnerable students. And block grants provide little or no accountability for student achievement. 
   In fact, the Republican proposal would engage a risky, three-year experiment--an experiment that is not based on any proven strategies--all with the hope that 3 years down the road, students will not have fallen behind. 
   Let me be clear about one thing: While many schools are making dramatic gains, we cannot be satisfied with the status quo. We need to make sure all students are achieving at high standards. 
   So the question is: What's the best way to improve public education? 
   After my own experience as an educator, a parent and a school board member, I've seen that making an investment in the things we know work--reducing classroom overcrowding and improving teacher quality--is the way to improve public education. 
   Today, the Federal Government provides only 7 percent of all education funding. The Federal Government's role is small. But we Democrats want to make sure that every one of those Federal dollars are going where they will help students the most. That means making sure they remain targeted to vulnerable students and investing in reducing class size, improving teacher quality, helping school districts build new schools and modernize old ones, and closing the digital divide. 
   Even though the Federal Government only provides 7 cents of every education dollar, we know where that money goes. 
   We can tell parents how many children are being helped by specific programs. This chart shows how many students are served by specific programs and who will lose under the block grant provisions of S. 2. 
   For example, who will lose? Mr. President, 12.7 million children in a title 1 program; 71,300 parents and students, or 32,000 families, will lose in the Even Start Program; 197,000 students in the Neglected and Delinquent Youth Program; Class Size Reduction Program, 29,000 teachers and 1.7 million children. The list goes on. 
   Under all of these programs, we see millions of real students who are going to lose out under block grants. 
   Republican block grants would take all of these vital programs, pool the money together, and then write a blank check to the States, with no accountability. Today, we know where our tax dollars are going. But under block grants, we could not even tell taxpayers where their money was going. That is not responsible accounting budget, but that is the approach the Republicans are taking. 
   The other side thinks Federal dollars should not be targeted to meet specific needs. But many educators have told me that if these dollars were not targeted, the kids who need them the most would not get them. 
   Block grants provide no focus on proven, effective strategies to improve schools. States could even start private school vouchers that would drain funds away from public schools, where 90 percent of the students are enrolled. They would take the money from these programs and they could use it for that under this bill. 
   When it comes to accountability, Federal education dollars are seven times more targeted to poor students than State and local dollars. That targeting ensures that poor kids have the resources they need. 
   Unfortunately, the first thing block grants will do is eliminate that targeting. It's not hard to predict the results--poor students will end up with fewer resources. 
   Today, we know money is targeted to poor children. We have accountability. Under block grants, we don't know. There's no accountability to meet the needs of poor students. 
   Next I'd like to turn to student achievement because, unfortunately, the Republican block grant proposal requires little or no accountability for better student achievement. The bill does not define what, if any, consequences schools would face if they fail, nor does it specify when failing schools would face consequences. 
   A state would be free to ignore failing schools and the disadvantaged students who attend them. Only after 3 years are states held accountable for educational results. And even then, the accountability is weak--it just says that states must follow the underlying law. By that time, students have lost three critical years of learning. 
   Mr. President, this Republican Congress would take students across the country on a three-year experiment that is not based in proven, effective strategies, that will cut the lifelines to vulnerable students, and that will mean less money for the classroom, and less accountability to taxpayers. That's not a sound education policy--that's a disaster waiting to happen. 
   Under the Republican experiment, there will be no guarantee that money for poor students will go to poor students. Under their experiment, there will be no guarantee that money will go to the proven strategies that help students. 
   They would have us experiment like that for three years, and then we'll see what happens to the students. Anyone looking at that proposal can see poor kids are going to fall behind when resources are no longer targeted to them. 
   Democrats want accountability in education programs. We think we need to be able to tell taxpayers where their hard-earned tax dollars are going. We think we need to be able to tell taxpayers their money is being targeted to the most critical needs. And we think we need to be able to show taxpayers that students are improving. And we don't think we can take three years of a child's education and experiment with that critical time, when students need to master the building blocks of learning. 
   Today, we know where tax dollars are going. Under block grants, we don't know. 
   Today, we know money is targeted to critical needs. Under block grants, we don't know. 
   Today, we know public tax dollars will stay in public schools. Under block grants, we don't know. 
   Under the Republican bill, we would experiment for three years and hope students don't fall through the cracks. 
   That's why we're against this proposal. Democrats want to keep our education dollars accountable. I urge my colleagues to reject block grants and stand up for accountability. 
   So, Mr. President, that's the Republican agenda: block grants and vouchers, cutting lifelines to 
   vulnerable students, less money for the classroom, and less accountability to taxpayers. 
   Parents, teachers and students have told us that agenda won't help all students reach their potential. They want us to invest in the things they know make a difference in the classroom--proven, effective strategies like reducing overcrowding. 
   Two years ago, we agreed on a bipartisan basis that we would help school districts hire 100,000 new, fully-qualified teachers to reduce classroom overcrowding. 
   This year, 1.7 million students across the country are learning in classrooms that are less crowded than they were  the year before. These students are learning in classrooms where teachers can spend more time teaching, and less time dealing with discipline problems. These students are getting the individual attention they need to learn the basics. 
   During the upcoming debate, I plan to offer an amendment to this bill to authorize the class size reduction program. This program has been so successful and we should authorize it so that it can help every student in this country reach high academic standards. 
   Throughout my state I've heard from superintendents, principals, teachers, and parents that reducing class size is really making a difference. We can't abandon this commitment to our schools! 
   Don Worley, of Kettle Falls Elementary School in Washington State recently told me:  
   The class size reduction program is one of the best things for kids from the federal government in a long time--reading scores are up and this is really making a difference.  
   I ask my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, why would you want to abandon an effort like this when it's really making a difference? 
   The first grade teachers at Eisenhower Elementary School in the Vancouver School District recently sent me a list of how smaller class size is making a difference in their school. 
   They said the following things-- 
   ``Each student receives significantly more one-on-one help for academics and behavior.'' 
   ``More curriculum is covered in all areas.'' 
   ``Students are leaving the classroom with the ability to read.'' 
   ``Students have less ``wait time'' for all kinds of teachers responses.'' 
   ``More time is available to really get to know the student.'' 
   And ``less paperwork leaves more time for students.'' 
   Those are the words of teachers, who are telling us this is making a difference. 
   That's why I plan to offer an amendment that would provide $1.75 billion to our schools to reduce class size in grades 1 through 3. 
   This amendment will target the money where it is needed within states, and 99 percent of the funds will 
   be disbursed directly to local school districts on a formula which is 80 percent need-based, and 20 percent enrollment-based. 
   The class size reduction program will ensure local decision-making and flexibility. School districts can use all funds to reduce class size, or use up to 25 percent for other needs. 
   Any school district that has already reduced class size in the early grades to 18 or fewer children can use funds: to further reduce class sizes in the early grades, to reduce class size in kindergarten or other grades, or to carry out activities to improve teacher quality, including professional development. 
   In small districts where the funding level is not enough to hire a new teacher, districts can choose to spend the funds on other activities, such as professional development, recruitment, testing new teachers, or providing professional development to new and current teachers of regular and special needs children. 
   Mr. President, if you look just in my state at how different school districts are using their class size money, you can see how flexible the program is. 
   In Washington, the North Thurston School District is using all of their money to hire teachers to reduce class size. At the same time, the Pomeroy School District, which is a rural district in Eastern Washington, used 100 percent of their funding for professional development for their teachers. The Seattle School District even used a portion of its funding to recruit teachers. 
   The class size reduction program is simple and efficient. School districts fill out a one-page form, which is available on-line. 
   And let me just add that teachers have told me that they have never seen money move so quickly from Congress to the classroom. Linda McGeachy in the Vancouver School District recently said: ``the language is very clear, applying was very easy, and these funds really work to support classroom teachers.'' 
   Mr. President, I've worked as an educator, and I know it makes a big difference if you have 18 kids in a classroom or if you have 25 or 30 kids in a classroom. Smaller classes provide a better environment for kids to learn the basics with fewer discipline problems. 
   And smaller classes are an example of how Democrats are making a commitment to improving public education. 
   Republicans won't make that commitment, and the American people are going to get to decide which approach will help students more. 
   We believe that we should put our money behind the things that local educators tell us produce results. We believe that we should keep our commitment to vulnerable students. We believed that we should keep education dollars accountable. And we believe that we shouldn't let block grants shortchange students. 
   If you agree that we can't turn our backs on vulnerable students and critical needs, if you agree that we can't break our commitment to the things that are improving America's schools, and if you agree that we can't let block grants cut education funding and hurt students, I invite you to join our effort--along with thousands of parents and educators across America--to reject block grants and finally make a real, national commitment to the strategies that are revolutionizing America's schools. 
   Join us in this effort--let your Senators know they should reject block grants and instead support smaller class sizes, safe and modern schools, and high-quality teachers. Students across America are depending on it.

   Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise today to express my strong support of the rights of crime victims and of all Americans. In the last few years, Congress has passed laws to increase the rights of crime victims and their families. Congress has provided crime victims the right to attend and to speak at court proceedings, the right to be notified of a criminal's parole or escape, and the right to receive restitution. 
   Congress has been able to expand victims' rights by doing what we do often--pass laws. Today, we are asked to do something we do very rarely--to amend the United States Constitution. 
   I support crime victims. I want to expand their protections, but I don't believe that amending the Constitution is the best way to do it. As the examples I mentioned have shown, we can expand and clarify victims' rights significantly--without tampering with the Constitution. A constitutional amendment is not necessary to help crime victims. 
   Any time we think about changing the Constitution, we must consider the words of James Madison, its principal author. Madison explained that amending the Constitution should only be reserved for ``certain great and extraordinary occasions,'' when no other alternatives are available. 
   Despite all the changes in our country over the last 213 years, we've only amended the Constitution on 27 occasions, 10 of which were the Bill of Rights. Most of these constitutional amendments were passed to reflect fundamental changes in the attitudes of Americans such as ensuring the rights of minorities and the right of women to vote. 
   This is not a ``great and extraordinary occasion.'' In the last 20 years, we in Congress and the states have done a good job of ensuring better and more comprehensive rights and services for crime victims. There are more than 30,000 laws nationwide that define and protect victims' rights. There are tens of thousands of organizations that provide assistance to people who have been victims of crime. 
   Thirty-two States have passed constitutional amendments in their own state constitutions to protect the rights of crime victims. My own home State of Washington has both laws on the books and provisions in our state constitution that provide crime victims and their families the right to attend trial, the right to be informed of court proceedings, the right to make a statement at sentencing or any proceeding where the defendant's release is considered, and the right to enter an order of restitution. There is no evidence that the laws in my state and others like it are failing to protect victims. 
   Not only is this not a ``great and extraordinary occasion,'' but this amendment could actually erode the rights of Americans rather than expand on them. Defendants in criminal proceedings in this country are presumed to be innocent. This amendment would  give victims and their families the right to be heard at all critical stages of the trial. This amendment could allow victims to sway the trial against a defendant before they have been convicted, thus seriously compromising the presumption of innocence. 
   The amendment could also compromise a defendant's right to a fair trial. Judges have enormous discretion in determining which witnesses should be able to attend the proceedings in their courtroom. Many times, a witness' testimony could be compromised if that witness hears the testimony of others. For example, if the victim is allowed to hear the testimony of the defendant, the victim could change his or her testimony based on what the defendant said. Even worse, if a victim attends the testimony of the accused, the trauma or intimidation they experience could damage their subsequent testimony. 
   The judge should have discretion over who can be excluded from the courtroom at particular stages of the trial to ensure that the defendant has a fair trial. This amendment would 
   give victims the right to attend the entire criminal trial regardless of whether the judge believes their presence could taint the fairness of the proceeding. Judges help ensure that defendants have a fair trial. This amendment would jeopardize that protection. 
   The amendment could also affect defendants and the prosecutors' ability to present their case. The amendment would give victims a right to intervene and assert a constitutional right for a faster disposition of the matter. In many cases, the defendants and prosecutors need time to develop their arguments. This amendment could force a premature conclusion to cases that may require additional deliberation. 
   In some cases, the victims are actually defendants. This happens many times in domestic violence cases when the abused victims finally defend themselves from their attacker. In these cases, the abuser could actually be granted special rights that could place a domestic violence victim at greater risk. Why should the abuser get special rights? This is one reason why many domestic violence victims' advocates oppose this amendment. 
   Finally, the proposed victims' rights amendment could hurt effective prosecutions and would place enormous burdens on the criminal justice system. The amendment gives victims the right to be notified and to comment on negotiated pleas or sentences. More than 90 percent of all criminal cases do not go to trial but are resolved through negotiation. Giving victims a right to obstruct plea agreements could backfire by requiring prosecutors to disclose weaknesses in their case. It could also compromise the ability of a prosecutor to gain the cooperation of one defendant to improve the chance of convincing others. In the end, guilty defendants could better present their case if they are privy to strategy and details of the prosecutions' case. The rights of notification could also result in large burdens on the criminal justice system, compromising resources to effectively prosecute criminals. 
   An amendment to the Constitution is not the right approach. We should continue to do the things that have worked in the past without taking this drastic step. Current State and Federal laws give victims extensive rights at trial. 
   For these reasons, I have cosponsored a proposal by Senators LEAHY and KENNEDY. This statutory change would give crime victims the right to be heard and be notified of proceedings and the right to a speedy trial. It would also enhance participatory rights at trial and do other things to give victims and their families a greater ability to get involved in the prosecution of the criminals that harmed them. All of these rights would be subject to the judge's discretion. We in Congress should not be in the business of telling judges how to balance the rights of the accused and those of the victims. 
   I urge my colleagues to support the Leahy/Kennedy compromise and reject the constitutional amendment that may do more to compromise the rights of Americans rather than expand them. 
   Before, I close, I want to make one final point. If we really want to do something for crime victims, we should reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act, VAWA, which expires this year. If we do not act, we jeopardize funding and we miss a vital opportunity to strengthen this historic act. 
   Even using conservative estimates, one million women every year are victims of violent crimes by an intimate partner. We know that one in three women can expect to be the victim of a violent crime at some point in her life. The chance of being victimized by an intimate partner is ten times greater for a woman than for a man. Domestic violence is statistically consistent across racial and ethnic lines--it does not discriminate based on race or economic status. Eighty-eight percent of victims of domestic violence fatalities had a documented history of physical abuse and 44 percent of victims of intimate homicide had prior threats by the killer to kill the victim or self. These are frightening statistics and show us that violence against women is a real threat. How will a Constitutional amendment prevent these crimes or even provide safety and support to the victims? 
   VAWA changed the entire culture of violence against women and empowered communities to respond to this devastating plague. Since 1995 we have provided close to $1.8 billion to address violence against women. VAWA funding supports well over 1,000 battered women shelters in this country. The National Domestic Violence Hotline enacted as part of VAWA, fielded 73,540 calls in 1996 alone, and in 1998 the hotline fielded 109,339 calls. We have many success stories and we know what works. 
   There is no reason to delay reauthorization. We still have so much more to do. We know the demand for services and assistance for victims is only increasing. As a result of more outreach and education, women no longer feel trapped in violent homes or relationships. Domestic violence is no longer simply a family problem but a public health threat to the community. While we have seen an explosion in funding for battered women's shelters, we also know that hundreds of women and children are still turned away from overcrowded shelters. We have heard reports that individual states had to turn away anywhere from 5,000 to 15,000 women and children in just one year. I know that limited safe shelter space is a growing problem in Washington state. What can we do for these victims? What rights do they have? The reauthorized legislation, S. 51, provides much greater hope to these victims than even federal and state laws to protect the rights of victims in the court process. The bill currently has 47 cosponsors. 
   If we are concerned about victims and the rights of victims we should be acting to reauthorize and strengthen VAWA.

   Mrs. MURRAY. First, I thank the Senator from New Jersey, Mr. LAUTENBERG, for his tremendous leadership on the Democratic side of the Budget Committee. I have truly enjoyed working with him and will miss him a great deal in the coming years. His leadership has been so important to all of us. 
   I come to the floor today to address the Republican budget proposal and to tell my colleagues that I will be a ``no'' vote because I believe it fails to reflect the priorities of families across this country. In fact, if this budget were submitted to any math class, it would get an F because, frankly, the numbers do not add up. 
   The reality in this budget does not meet the rhetoric. Despite all the claims, when we do the math, the things Americans care about--improving their education, reducing the debt, saving Social Security, strengthening and modernizing Medicare--have all been left behind. The things that matter to families have been sacrificed in the name of an irresponsible tax cut. 
   I am disappointed that this budget abandons the progress we have made since 1993. Since I first joined the Budget Committee, our Nation's financial strength has grown dramatically. Through the hard work of the President, the Vice President, and Congress, we have turned deficits into surpluses. We learned many important lessons. We learned that budgets must be realistic. They have to take into account what our Nation needs and what we are capable of providing. 
   This budget is neither realistic nor responsible. It does not provide the necessary investments in education and health care. It does not ensure that prescription drug coverage for Medicare beneficiaries will be considered before we enact tax cuts. Instead, this Republican budget sacrifices our priorities for a $200 billion tax cut. 
   I am extremely concerned that this tax cut could eat up all of the on-budget surplus. Given this Congress' track record on tax cuts, it is fair to assume that, as usual, the top 10 percent of the people will get more than 60 percent of the benefits. The President and the American people rejected that tax plan last year, and I expect they will reject it again. We can have responsible and fair tax cuts that are fiscally prudent, but you won't find them in this budget. 
   I am also disappointed that this conference report dropped two important priorities during the conference committee. First, an important amendment I introduced to ensure programs that help victims of domestic violence was dropped. Another amendment concerning pipeline safety was also left behind. In the Senate Budget Committee, I introduced an amendment to ensure that pipeline safety efforts are funded at levels that were called for in my bill. My amendment was unanimously passed by the Senate Budget Committee. Unfortunately, this budget makes it almost impossible to fully fund the Office of Pipeline Safety. Our budget should help us make our pipeline safer. I fear this budget moves away from our responsibility. 
   I will be talking later this evening about the issue of pipeline safety as well. 
   While those two key amendments were dropped, I am pleased that my amendment concerning women and Social Security was affirmed. After 2 years, the Republican budget conferees have 
   finally committed that Social Security reform should not penalize women. I am pleased it is in this budget. 
   Overall, to make room for their tax cut, Republicans shortchanged the investments that really matter to the American people. In fact, in key areas, this budget doesn't even keep up with inflation. 
   I will give a few examples of how this budget leaves America's priorities behind. The decisions in this budget will be felt in classrooms across America. The budget before us would decimate the progress we have made over the last 2 years in reducing overcrowded classrooms. In the last 2 years, we have hired 29,000 new, fully qualified teachers to reduce class sizes in first, second, and third grades. Today, because of that action, 1.7 million students are learning in classrooms where the basics are taught in a disciplined environment. We should be building on our progress. This Republican budget before us today abandons our progress. This budget tells students: Sorry, you are going to have to sit in an overcrowded classroom next year because, under the Republican tax plan, you are not a priority. 
   It should be a priority that we pay down our national debt instead of passing that burden along to our children. This budget tells every young American: Sorry, you better start saving money now to pay off the national debt because, under the Republican tax plan, you are not a priority. 
   It is a priority that we strengthen and modernize Medicare. It is a priority that seniors get help buying the medicine they need because no one should have to choose between buying medicine and paying for food. This budget tells seniors: Sorry, you can't get the prescription drug coverage you need because, under the Republican tax plan, you are not a priority. 
   The American people want real budgets, not gimmicks. They want to know that our Nation's vital priorities are being treated as priorities. They don't want the things that matter in their lives to be squeezed out by unbalanced tax cuts that only benefit a few people. 
   We should be using the surplus we have today to honor our commitments to our children and to our seniors. Now is the time to address the long-term solvency of Social Security and Medicare and to provide resources to local communities to make our classrooms ready for the 21st century. Those are the things a responsible budget would do. We should pass a budget that reflects the priorities of the American people and one that is realistic. I believe the budget before us fails the American people on both counts. Therefore, I must oppose it.  
   I thank the Chair and yield the remainder of my time to the Democratic side.

   Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I would like to share with my colleagues some recent developments on the pipeline safety legislation I introduced two months ago. I'm pleased to report that in the past week, we've made a lot of progress. 
   About 10 months have passed since a gasoline pipeline in Bellingham, Washington ruptured--spilling more than 275,000 gallons of gasoline. That pipeline disaster killed three young people, and left thousands of people in my state wondering about the safety of the pipelines near their homes. 
   We can't undo what happened in Bellingham--it will never be the same. But we can make sure that what happened in Bellingham doesn't happen anywhere else. 
   There are 2.2 million miles of pipelines running across the country--bringing us the energy we need to fuel our cars and heat our homes. They run near our schools, houses and communities. We have a responsibility to make sure these pipelines are safe. And it is clear that the current laws are not sufficient. 
   That's why I introduced my pipeline safety bill back in January. Since that time, I have been meeting with the Administration, with Senators, safety officials, citizen groups, and industry representatives. 
   This week, I spoke at a national conference on pipeline safety here in Washington, D.C. It was hosted by the National Pipeline Reform Coalition, SAFE Bellingham, and the Cascade Columbia Alliance. 
   I can tell you that people all across the country are following this issue closely, they understand the problem, and they are calling for action.  
   I want to be clear. We cannot wait any longer--and we can certainly not let this year pass without improving our nation's inadequate pipeline safety laws. 
   The danger posed by aging, corroded pipelines is not going away. In fact, it's getting worse. 
   Since 1986, there have been more than 5,700 pipeline accidents, 325 deaths, 1,500 injuries. More than $850 million in environmental damage. On average there is 1 pipeline accident every day, and 6 million hazardous gallons are spilled every year. 
   In the two months since I introduced my pipeline safety bill, at least 20 states--almost half of the country--have experienced pipeline accidents. Let me repeat that. In just two months, 20 more states have had pipeline accidents. 
   Just last week there was a major pipeline spill in Maryland. The clock is ticking, and the list of affected communities is growing. 
   Back home in Washington state, there is a great deal of impatience that Congress has not acted on pipeline safety measures. This editorial by the Bellingham Herald--from April 5th--gives you a good sense of how many of my constituents feel. 
   It's titled, Wake Up, Pipeline Bill Is On The Way. It's addressed to Congress, and it says, in part:  
   Don't know if you had a chance to look at our pipeline bill, but we're sending you a message. We want you to hear us loud and clear.  
   And later it says:  
   *.*.* even though what happened in Bellingham could happen in any one of your home states, we feel you aren't giving this issue much attention.  
   As this editorial says--these accidents can happen in any of our states. I don't want another community to go through what the people of Bellingham, Washington have gone through. We can make pipelines safer today. 
   My bill addresses five key areas of pipeline safety: My bill will expand state authority over pipeline safety. My bill will improve inspection and prevention practices. My bill will invest in new safety technology. My bill will expand the public's right to know about problems with pipelines. Finally, my bill will increase funding to improve pipeline safety by providing funds for new state and federal pipeline safety programs. 
   I'm proud to say that we are making progress. And I want to share with you some recent developments. 
   Yesterday, Senator MCCAIN announced that he has scheduled a hearing on pipeline safety for May 11, and he has committed to marking up a pipeline safety bill by the end of May. He also introduced his own pipeline safety bill. 
   As you may recall, in February, I sent a letter to Senator MCCAIN asking for a hearing. Last week, I spoke with him in person about it, and he pledged to work with me on this issue. As he told me, ``this is the right thing to do.'' 
   I would like to commend Senator MCCAIN for moving the process forward. I would also like to share with the Senate the important work done by the parents of the young people who were killed in the Bellingham explosion, especially Mr. Frank King. On Tuesday, Mr. King met with Senator MCCAIN's staff, and in bringing his own personal story to the Senate--he has helped move this legislation forward. 
   I'm pleased today to become the Democratic sponsor of Senator MCCAIN's bill. This bill contains many of the elements of the legislation I introduced back in January. The bill also includes some of the good elements of the Administration's proposal, which was introduced this week. 
   Senator MCCAIN, as chairman of the Commerce Committee, has done a service to our nation and the state of Washington by providing his leadership on this important topic. 
   During the committee process, I hope we can all work together in a bipartisan manner to make the McCain-Murray bill even more effective at improving pipeline safety. There is still a long way to go, and I look forward to working with Senator MCCAIN on this important issue. 
   Another step forward took place this week, when the Clinton/Gore Administration sent its pipeline safety proposal to Congress. Working with us, the Administration has crafted a proposal which includes many of my priorities: It places a clear value on the importance of safety. It strengthens community ``right to know'' provisions. It improves inspection standards. It invests in research and development for inspection devices. And it increases penalties for safety violations. 
   This proposal is a good first step, and now we will work to improve it. Clearly, there are some differences on the partnership with states provisions and other areas, and I will be working to strengthen them within the legislative process. I should add that the Administration's bill has been introduced in the Senate by Senators HOLLINGS and SARBANES, and in the House by Representatives SHUSTER, OBERSTAR, FRANKS, and WISE. 
   I want to commend the Vice President, who learned about this issue when he was in Washington state. He recognized the importance of pipeline safety, and he has been working to prompt the Administration to act quickly. I also appreciate the work Transportation Secretary Rodney Slater has done. Shortly after the explosion, he stationed a pipeline inspector in Washington state. 
   So clearly we are making some progress, but there is still much more to do. Unfortunately, the Senate leadership has not expressed a lot of interest in pipeline safety. 
   I recently received a note from the majority leader's office--listing almost 50 bills that he has deemed ``Legislative Calendar Items'' which he hopes to consider prior to the August recess. Pipeline safety was not on his list. Now, I know priority lists are flexible, and I hope we can get a pipeline safety bill through the committee and onto the Senate floor for consideration before August. 
   We need to pass a pipeline safety bill, and we need to do it now. I again ask my colleagues to stand with the thousands of people who have been adversely affected by pipeline disasters and pass a bill that will make sure no other community has to suffer from another pipeline disaster. 
   We have a strong pipeline safety bill. We have Administration support. And we have a commitment from the Commerce Committee leadership to pass legislation this year. 
   This is our chance for safer pipelines, for safer communities, and for peace of mind. We have a bill. It's up to this Congress, this year to make sure this opportunity doesn't pass us by.

    Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Apple Orchard Diversification Act of 2000. 
   Mr. President, I am proud that Washington state produces more apples than any other state in the nation. The apple industry is an independent group. It has made Washington state and U.S. apples and apple products popular in many corners of the world. In the mid-1990s, growers were doing well, markets were opening and expanding, and the future looked bright. 
   But in 1998 and 1999, the bottom fell out from under them. Low prices and weather-related disasters devastated apple producers, and growers of hundreds of other commodities nationwide. In northeastern and mid-Atlantic states, fruit and vegetable growers were hit hard by freezing temperatures and drought. In the Pacific Northwest, some growers were hurt by bad weather. 
   But the biggest problem is low prices. These low prices are caused by the Asian financial crisis; by market access problems; by below-cost apple juice concentrate dumping by China; by record world-wide production and oversupply; and other factors. 
   The results are devastating, especially in my home state of Washington. Nationwide, the industry lost an estimated $300 million on the 1998 crop. In Okanogan County in Washington state, some organizations have estimated that 90 percent of apple growers will not recover their 1999 expenses. Okanogan County already experiences high unemployment. It cannot afford a long-term, depressed farm economy. The county declared an economic disaster and urged the state to do the same. Meanwhile, other counties, especially in north central Washington, are trying to respond to this disaster. Many growers will go out of business. Others will not be able to get commercial lending this year. 
   The Administration and members of this Congress are working to resolve some of the issues facing the industry and rural communities. 
   Last year, Congress passed a large disaster relief package for agriculture. I supported this package because it kept many producers above water for another year. However, like many of my colleagues, I was frustrated this package did not do more for specialty crop producers. Congress provided $1.2 billion in crop loss assistance. Specialty crop producers, including apple growers, were eligible to receive assistance to address weather-related disasters, and some growers did. But, in states like Washington, the aid package did too little. 
   Fortunately, action is occurring on the most important issue facing the apple industry. Earlier this month, the U.S. Department of Commerce levied anti-dumping duties of 51.74 percent on the majority of imports of below-cost apple juice concentrate from China. The Administration's preliminary anti-dumping duty ruling in November 1999 helped our producers by raising the price of both juice apples and concentrate. By May 22, the U.S. International Trade Commission will make its final injury ruling. If an injury determination is made, the Administration will 
   implement anti-dumping duties at the levels prescribed by the Commerce Department. 
   Our second victory was to address pest control in abandoned orchards. During my trip to central Washington last August, I heard from community leaders that this was a real problem. 
   Low prices have caused many producers to abandon their orchards, and some of these orchards became infested. Infested orchards impact the operations of other producers and create potential trade problems. In response, counties tore out trees and sprayed orchards. But last year, funds in many counties were running low. 
   USDA holds defaulted loans on some of these abandoned orchards. Last year, I urged the agency to take responsibility for pest control on those properties. The Farm Service Agency in Washington state created a strategy for reimbursing counties for pest control In October 1999, I wrote to Secretary Glickman to urge him to approve FSA's reimbursement strategy. Shortly thereafter, USDA implemented this initiative so counties could continue to control pests. 
   The third victory for apple and specialty crop producers may come soon, when President Clinton signs risk management reform legislation into law. The bill passed by the Senate would make major changes to federal crop insurance policy to ensure that all producers, including specialty crop growers, will have access to more viable risk management products. 
   But more needs to be done. My highest priorities for agriculture remain investing in research, expanding trade, and providing a safety net when economic and natural disasters strike. 
   Last November, I introduced S. 1983, the Agricultural Market Access and Development Act. My bill would authorize the Secretary of Agriculture to spend up to $200 million--but not less than the current $90 million--for the Market Access Program. And it would set a floor of $35 million for spending on the Foreign Market Development ``Cooperator'' Program. Senators CRAIG, BOXER, FEINSTEIN, GORDON SMITH, GORTON, WYDEN, CLELAND, and COVERDELL have all cosponsored this legislation, and I appreciate their support. 
   The USDA Foreign Agricultural Service has reported that in 1999 we experienced our first agricultural trade deficit with the European Union. We imported $7.7 billion of EU agricultural products and exported $6.8 billion. Our competitors have increased market promotion spending by 35 percent, or $1 billion, over the past three years. Our spending, however, has decreased one percent. 
   Agricultural exports are key to maintaining a reasonable trade balance. Other nations have invested in market development, and it's worked. We need to enhance our trade programs to give our producers a more level playing field and a fighting chance. 
   Besides expanding trade, we must strengthen the safety net for producers. We should not go back to our old Federal farm policies. Our program commodity growers do not want that, and our specialty crop producers do not want a new, permanent relationship with the federal government. 
   But I believe this farm crisis has taught us that we need flexible tools available for all producers when economic or natural disasters strike. For some commodities this may mean counter-cyclical payments. Or it may mean a variety of flexible loans that meet the needs of all producers or specific commodities. As we debate the next farm bill, we should give USDA flexibility, within fiscally-responsible guidelines, to respond to crises in agriculture. 
   Today, I am introducing legislation to create a one-time Apple Orchard Diversification Program. I have heard from growers that they could very much use a loan program to diversify their orchards into more commercially-viable varieties. Many of our producers invested heavily in Red and Golden Delicious apples, which are the varieties hardest hit by the economic crisis. We need a mechanism to allow these growers to diversify their orchards. 
   My bill would do just that. It would authorize USDA to provide up to $75 million in long-term, low-interest loans to apple producers. The loans could be used by producers to purchase trees for converting existing apply orchards into more profitable apple varieties. 
   My bill waives much of the regulatory process. USDA has been overwhelmed with managing disaster programs, and that has delayed relief. Instead, my bill bill requires USDA to conduct a stakeholder process, which  would include three hearings around the country. The industry would help develop the program, and address issues such as income and acreage qualifications for growers who receive loans, and parameters on payments, acreage and varietal stock quality. 
   The concept of orchard diversification was born when Under Secretary Gus Schumacher visited Quincy, Washington, in July 1999. The Under Secretary has spent a great deal of time in apply producing regions around the country. Mr. Schumacher has been criticized by some elected officials and individuals for holding the listening session in Washington state. But I appreciate, and I know many of our family farmers appreciate, his interest in these issues. 
   In conclusion, my grandfather moved to the Tri-Cities in the early 1990s to work for Welch's. As a young child, I remember many trips to central Washington at harvest time to visit my grandmother, who remained in the area after my grandfather's death. To this day, the smell of fresh picked peaches and apples remind me of my childhood. To my Dad, it meant much more; it meant how his family put food on the table and paid the mortgage. We grew up understanding how important family-run orchards were to our state's economy. 
   As I raised my own family, I always made sure we had a fruit tree in our yard. I wanted to remind myself of my years growing up and also to show my kids what a resource we have in our state. I could not imagine discussing Washington's economy without a box of apples being part of the picture. I want to make sure it stays that way for many generations to come. 
   Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to cosponsor and help pass this important legislation.

   Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, this Republican budget fails to reflect the priorities of families across America. 
   If this budget were submitted in any math class--it would get an F--because the numbers just don't add up. The reality doesn't match the rhetoric. 
   And while Republicans are talking about how great their budget is, when you do the math the things Americans care about--improving education, reducing the debt, saving Social Security, strengthening and modernizing Medicare--have all been left behind. 
   The things that matter to families have been sacrificed in the name of an irresponsible tax cut. 
   Mr. President, I am disappointed that this budget abandons the progress we have made since 1993. Since I first joined the Budget Committee, our nation's financial strength has grown dramatically. Through the hard work of the President, the Vice President, and others, we have turned deficits into surpluses. 
   And we learned two important lessons. First, budgets must be realistic--they have to take into account what our nation needs and what we are capable of providing. 
   Second, budgets must be responsible. A responsible budget meets our obligations. It makes sure that Social Security, Medicare and other existing commitments aren't left hanging. 
   But, Mr. President, this budget fails both tests--it is neither realistic nor responsible. This budget fails to provide the necessary investments in education, health care and prescription drug coverage. Instead, this Republican budget sacrifices our priorities for $200 billion in tax cuts. 
   This tax cut could eat up all of the on-budget surplus. Given this Congress' track record on tax cuts, it is fair to assume when we see the specifics they will be similar to Governor Bush's plan and to the tax bill Republicans tried to pass last year. 
   In both of those Republican plans, the top 10% of the people, get more than 60% of the benefits. The President and the American people rejected that tax plan last year, and I expect they will reject it again. 
   Mr. President, so far the majority has expressed interest in two specific tax provisions. Unfortunately, their efforts have been misguided. 
   First, the Majority has moved to repeal the marriage penalty. I support making sure that families in America are not penalized by our tax code. In fact, I am a cosponsor of S. 8, which would eliminate the marriage penalty. Our bill addresses a real problem--too many lower and middle income families are penalized by the current system. 
   But the majority's proposal--by giving further tax relief to those who already enjoy a marriage bonus--simply creates new inequities while still burdening lower and middle income families with a marriage penalty. 
   Mr. President, the Republicans have a second proposal--related to small businesses. Democrats fought to pass a minimum wage increase, which some of America's hardest workers desperately need. But the majority would only go along if their tax proposal was included. 
   What did we end up with? A minimum wage increase over 3 years instead of 2--so workers would have to wait an extra year to get the full benefit--and a tax plan that kept growing. While I support targeted tax cuts that will really help small businesses, I do not support the majority's approach, which abandons fiscal responsibility by the sheer size of their combined proposals. 
   Mr. President, I do want to take just a moment to mention three important positive statements we were able to include in the budget resolution. 
   I am pleased that my amendment placing a high priority on the unique needs of women in the Social Security debate was adopted in committee. This amendment recognizes the economic safety net of social security for women and puts the Senate on record in support of using the reform process to improve the economic condition of women. 
   This resolution also includes my amendment regarding the urgency of reauthorizing the Violence Against Women Act and the need to support full funding for these programs. We are facing a deadline on reauthorization--I want to make it clear that we will not abandon battered women and children during this short, legislative year. Regardless of the actions of Congress or the courts, we will work to continue funding for VAWA programs. 
   The third positive statement included in this budget resolution is my amendment on pipeline safety--which was adopted unanimously by the Budget Committee. My amendment says that pipeline safety efforts should be funded at the levels called for in my bill, S. 2004--the Pipeline Safety Act of 2000. 
   While I am proud that we were able to win concessions for these three important areas, overall this budget still puts tax cuts above vital investments. 
   Mr. President, while Republicans are saying that their budget funds key priorities, their rhetoric doesn't match the reality of their budget. The reality is that to make room for their tax cut, Republicans shortchange the investments that matter to the American people. In fact, in key areas, this budget doesn't even keep up with inflation. 
   Let me give you a few examples of how this misguided budget leaves America's priorities behind. The bad decisions in this budget will be felt in classrooms across America. This budget would decimate the progress we have made reducing overcrowded classrooms. Over the past two years, we've hired 29,000 new, fully qualified teachers to reduce class size. And today 1.7 million students are learning the basics in a disciplined environment. We should be building on our progress, but this Republican budget abandons our progress. 
   This budget tells students--``sorry, you'll have to sit in an overcrowded classroom next year because under the Republican tax plan--you are not a priority.'' 
   Mr. President, it's a priority that we save Social Security while our economy is so strong. We shouldn't wait until later to fix what we know needs to be changed. But this budget tells every American who will rely on Social Security in the years to come--``sorry, this budget won't save Social Security for you because under the Republican tax plan--you are not a priority.'' 
   Mr. President, it's a priority that we pay down our national debt--instead of passing that burden along to our children. But this budget tells every young American--``sorry, you better start saving money now to pay off the national debt--because under the Republican plan--you are not a priority.'' 
   Mr. President, it's a priority that we strengthen and modernize Medicare. It's a priority that seniors get help buying the medicine they need--because no one should have to choose between buying medicine and buying food. 
   But this budget tells seniors--``sorry, you can't get the prescription drug coverage you need because under the Republican tax plan--you are not a priority.'' 
   Mr. President, the American people want real budgets--not gimmicks. They want to know that our nation's vital priorities are being treated like priorities. They don't want the things that matter in their lives to be squeezed out by unbalanced tax cuts that would benefit only a few people. 
   Unfortunately, the driving force of this resolution has been tax cuts--tax cuts that explode in the outer years and jeopardize our fiscal strength. We should be using the surplus to honor our commitments to our children and our seniors. Now is the time to address the long-term solvency of Social Security and Medicare and to provide resources to local communities to make our classrooms ready for the 21st century. Those are the things a responsible budget does. 
   But as I look at this budget, the only priority I see is this exploding tax cut. Who gets left behind in this budget? 
   Students--who could lose the smaller classes they need; every American who will depend on Social Security; young people--who will still be burdened with our national debt; and seniors--who rely on Medicare and need prescription drug coverage. 
   They all get left behind, and that is wrong. I'm on the floor to say that they are priorities, and we will fight for them. 
   Mr. President, we should pass a budget that reflects the priorities of the American people and one that is realistic. This budget fails the American people on both counts, and therefore I must oppose it. Let's give the people  we represent a responsible budget that meets their needs.

   Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I take a moment to commend my colleagues--Senator ROBB, Senator HARKIN, Senator LAUTENBERG, and Senator DORGAN, for bringing this important amendment to the floor. 
   I commend the work they have done and their commitment to school modernization which means so much to our communities and the children who attend the public schools in this country. 
   I have heard the other side say throughout this debate they have made a commitment to education. But I am concerned, as I look at their budget, that a real commitment is missing. I believe that part of making a real commitment to education requires providing resources to our schools. Today, my colleagues are offering an amendment as a way to offer this choice. 
   Today, a record 53.2 million children are enrolled in elementary and secondary schools. By 2009, this number will reach 54.2 million. As a result, local communities need to build or modernize 6,000 public schools, and repair an additional 8,300 public schools. In addition, the average public school building in this country is 42 years old. These schools need improvements. 
   What kind of message do we send to our children when they can go to shopping malls, movies theaters, and baseball stadiums that are significantly nicer than their schools? What kind of message does that send about our priorities? 
   This amendment would once again provide us with a clear choice on the issue of education. Do we want a tax cut, or do we want to provide to modernize our schools. This amendment would allow the federal government to take a roll as a partner in helping our districts meet the pressing need of modernizing our school buildings. 
   The amendment would provide $1.3 billion in grants and loans to help schools address urgent facilities issues, and provide tax credit bonds to help communities finance the cost of new construction and major repairs for schools. 
   This Congress has made a commitment over the past two years to reducing class size. This program is truly making a difference in our schools. I believe we have the opportunity this year to continue the efforts to reducing class size, and providing funds for school to make sure they have the facilities to provide for these smaller classes. 
   A decent sized class in an adequate facility is not too much for our children. I hope you are all able to make this choice and support this amendment.

   Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I have come to the floor today to offer my support and thanks to Senators BINGAMAN and KENNEDY for offering this extremely important amendment. 
   Senator KERRY is exactly correct. The budget proposal before us is a sleight of hand. We should not be duped by that. It is very clear, in looking at the budget, that it shortchanges America's students. 
   The Republican budget proposal says tax cuts for a few are more important than a first-rate education for all of our children. Their budget tells students across America a tax cut is more important than their future. 
   We think that is wrong. We think that is incredibly wrong. We do not think America's students should only get the spare change left over after the Republican tax cut. America's students should not be the last in line in this budget. That is why we are offering this amendment today, to make sure all students get the resources they need to reach their full potential. 
   The Republican budget that is before us is very crafty because at first glance it looks as if education funding has been increased. But when you look closely at the numbers, it is really an empty promise. Senator KERRY of Massachusetts pointed that out. The rhetoric of this budget does not meet its reality. 
   I do want to acknowledge one thing. This underlying budget does one thing right. It does fund special education programs that the Senator from New Hampshire talked so eloquently about a few moments ago. That is important. We agree with that. Unfortunately,  that is the only thing this budget does well. 
   But every other education investment--whether it is reducing class size or improving teacher quality or modernizing our schools--is not treated as a priority in this budget. There are no guarantees in this budget that those other vital education programs will get the investments they need to continue to help America's students. 
   This budget funds one program and leaves the other programs hanging. It does not have to be this way. That is why I am supporting the Bingaman amendment. 
   This amendment says we can support special education. In fact, we support the same level as the Senator from New Hampshire. We are not disagreeing with that. But it says we can fund that and other key education investments at the same time. We should not have to choose which students get served. We should be serving every student. This amendment shows us how we can do that. 
   This budget's misplaced priorities will be felt in classrooms across the country. I am very concerned that this budget does not provide the resources to help our public schools move forward. I am concerned that this budget abandons the programs we know are working for students across this country. 
   Parents are asking us--pleading with us--to become partners with their local districts to help them with overcrowded classrooms. This Republican budget fails to make a commitment to reduce class size. 
   Teachers are asking us for more help in mastering the best ways to teach our children the basics. The Republican budget fails to make a commitment to teacher quality. 
   Students are asking us for schools where they can feel safe 
   and secure when they get off that schoolbus or walk to school every day. This Republican budget fails to make a commitment to school safety. 
   Parents are asking--and pleading--for afterschool programs so their children will not get into trouble or become victims of violence after school. This Republican budget fails to make a commitment to afterschool programs. 
   Teachers and students are asking for school buildings that are modern. This Republican budget fails to make a commitment to modernizing our aging schools. 
   The American people are asking for a stronger commitment to the programs that make a difference in their child's education. But the Republicans are too focused on their exploding tax cut to meet these needs of America's students. 
   This budget freezes our progress. That is why our amendment would put the resources where parents and teachers and students need them the most. 
   The amendment before us will ensure adequate funding for a number of key educational priorities. To reduce overcrowded classrooms, this amendment will provide $1.75 billion to continue our Class Size Reduction Program. Any Senator here can go home to their State, to their local schools that have taken advantage of the class size money we have passed over the last 2 years, and talk to teachers, and hear them say the same things I hear; which is, it has made an incredible difference. 
   I have teachers tell me every time I visit one of these classrooms that, where 5 years ago, 3 years ago, they had 24, 25, 30 kids in a classroom, that today, where they have 16, 17, 18 kids in a classroom, the difference is remarkable. 
   Teachers tell me in the small classes we have provided dollars for, in the first, second, and third grades, that those students--every one of them--will be able to read at the end of this year because of that reduced class size. This is making a difference. We have to keep that obligation going. We need to keep that partnership going. 
   Schools tell me every day they could not have done it without the commitment and the partnership of the Federal Government. The underlying budget fails to meet that. With this amendment, we on our Democratic side meet that obligation. 
   Our amendment modernizes school buildings by providing $1.3 billion. I was in a school a week ago where kids were in portables with no running water. In order to go to the bathroom they had to go outside in the rain, which is not uncommon in my State, go to another building and come back soaked. I saw kids in coats in classrooms because there was not enough heat in the school buildings. 
   We recognize we have an obligation, a partnership that we need to provide at the Federal level to meet these basic needs. Our amendment does that. This amendment looks at improving teacher quality. It provides $2 billion for professional development to recruit new educators and reward excellent teachers. We all understand that we need to make sure we have young people today committed to becoming teachers for our students tomorrow. We need to provide the dollars to partner with our local schools to make sure that they can recruit those best and brightest among our young students to be the teachers for our classrooms tomorrow. 
   This amendment ensures that students have safe educational activities at the end of the school day. It ensures adequate funding for afterschool programs. I commend Senator BOXER for her tremendous work on this initiative. We address that in this amendment. 
   To make sure that disadvantaged students have the extra classroom attention they need, this amendment will increase funding for title I programs by $1 billion. I have heard a lot of rhetoric in the HELP Committee and on the floor about local control and sending money to the States and that this is somehow miraculously going to happen. Talk to your local schools, as I have; talk to your title I schools. They will tell you this program has changed dramatically since its inception. They will tell you they have much more flexibility and local control. They fear us sending a block grant to the State will mean they lose the access and the ability to ensure that the money will be there for disadvantaged students in the future. 
   This amendment recognizes how important title I funding is to ensure that the kids at the bottom get the opportunity to learn as well. We increase title I funding by $1 billion to address the incredible needs out there. 
   Finally, this amendment will increase funding for Pell grants, grants that help disadvantaged students go to college, by $400 per year for each student. I would guess that my colleagues hear the same thing I hear when I talk to young people about the incredible amount of debt they accrue when they go to college, debt they have to pay off. We have to make sure we allow the kids at the bottom to have access to higher education. We recognize this in the amendment by increasing the Pell grants for students so we can assure that more young people can go on to college and our best and brightest will be encouraged to go on to college no matter what their income is. 
   These are the types of investments we should be making in America's young people. Unfortunately, the Republicans have the wrong priorities in their budget. They are putting their tax cut ahead of the needs of America's students. We know they are wrong, and we have introduced this amendment to make sure our students don't lose out. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. For those members of the majority who are inclined to oppose it, I want them to know this amendment would take only 15 percent of the tax cut and put it towards education. I can't think of a better priority for this Senate to support. I don't think it is too much to ask for America's students. By voting for this amendment, we will be saying that the young people of our country are a priority. They deserve a budget that treats them as a priority. 
   I thank the Chair and yield my time back to the Senator from Nevada.

   Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, 2 weeks ago, I sat through several days of discussion on education policy as we marked up the Elementary and Secondary Education Act in the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee. 
   Just last week, I went home and visited schools across Washington State and met with administrators, teachers, parents, and students. 
   The discussions we had here in Congress and the discussions I had in those classrooms could not have been more different. No wonder so many educators and parents are frustrated with Congress. Too often, what they hear from Congress has nothing to do with the real challenges they are facing. 
   While some of my colleagues were pushing their agenda of block grants and vouchers here in Washington, DC, the teachers I met with in Washington State were concerned about their ability to teach the basics and maintain discipline in their classrooms. 
   While these same colleagues of mine sought to diminish accountability, the parents I met with want us to insist that we have the highest possible academic standards in safe and modern classrooms. 
   While these same colleagues of mine were figuring out ways to shift resources away from meeting specific needs, the students I met with were wondering when there would be enough fully qualified teachers in their classrooms to help them get the individual attention they need to succeed. 
   Those parents, teachers, and students were shocked when I told them that my amendment to guarantee money for smaller class sizes was rejected by members of the Education Committee. It just does not make sense to them. 
   I wish that when we discussed ESEA, we had a few of those teachers sitting in the room with us. And whenever the discussion drifted to things that are far from the realities in today's classrooms, I wish those teachers were here to stand up and bring the discussion back to the real challenges our students face, day-in and day-out. 
   Today, too many teachers see overcrowded classrooms, children who arrive with basic needs unmet, jammed hallways, and tougher curriculum requirements. 
   Today, too many parents see teachers who are overworked--teachers who spend so much time on discipline it is hard for them to give every child the time and attention they need. 
   Today, too many students feel their needs are lost and their education is not a priority. All of us want to make sure that schools are safe centers of learning. 
   To reach their potential, our kids need real help now. They need the common sense solutions that we know can help them succeed. 
   It is simple. We know what works in education. We know what it takes to help children reach their potential. It is not a great mystery. These are the things that years of research have shown us are effective. They are the things that parents, teachers, and community leaders know make a difference. To show how simple this is, I have listed those ingredients we know work. 
   I am proud that Democrats are focusing on results with a commonsense agenda. We know that if we want children to succeed in school, they need a highly-motivated, fully-qualified teacher. We know they need a safe and modern classroom. We know they need a small, uncrowded class in which to learn. We know they need a focus on the basics. We know they need high standards and discipline. We know they need support from family and adults. We know they need resources for the classroom. 
   These are the commonsense policies that serve America's children--the policies that improve education and get results. 
   But unfortunately, this Congress is ignoring these proven approaches. They are ignoring what works. They do not want money to be targeted to these essential ingredients. They do not want us to focus on making sure that every school has guaranteed resources in each of these areas. 
   Many of us want to use these key ingredients to make the best schools possible. We want to guarantee that every school has the resources it needs. We want to change our schools--for the better--so we can get the results parents, students, and teachers are demanding. 
   Some have proposed block grants as the cure-all for education. Today, our nation's education policy guarantees that specific resources will be targeted to meeting specific needs. That is how responsible budgeting is done. That is how we ensure accountability. 
   But this Congress is working toward eliminating those guarantees. They do not want money to be guaranteed for reducing class sizes or for technology training for teachers or for modernizing schools. They want to eliminate all of those guarantees, create a pot of money, and give it to the States. 
   One teacher asked me: ``Are there any studies that show that giving all the money to States in block grants actually improves education?'' 
   Of course not. In fact, 35 years ago the American people made the national Government a partner in education because they realized that State and local governments cannot do it all on their own. 
   Public schools are one of the foundations upon which our democracy is built, and we need to do a better job of helping them perform at the highest levels. 
   Most disconcerting about these proposals for block grants is they are simply a blank check policy that will diminish the guarantee that education resources go to the students who need them most. Money that currently goes to hiring and training teachers and helping students with special needs--under these proposals could be used ``for any education purposes''--anything from building a new lockerroom to redecorating office space. 
   In response to many who want a better education, some have proposed vouchers. What will that do? Without a doubt, it will drain scarce dollars away from public schools where 90 percent of America's children are trying to learn. Vouchers plans shift taxpayer dollars away from public schools to private and religious schools. 
   One parent in Washington told me last week: ``I don't want you to give me a few hundred dollars to send my kid to another school. I want you to make my school work better.'' 
   The real question, and the one we are failing to answer, is: How can we work in partnership with states, educators, and parents to make sure that every student gets the things they need to reach their potential? 
   Many of my colleagues are asking the wrong question. they ask: How can the Federal Government's role in education be eliminated? They are talking about process, when we should be focusing on results. 
   This Congress should be asking: How can the Federal Government support local schools? How can we meet our national education priorities, like making sure every child can read, write, and use a computer? 
   And how can we help school districts do the things that are hardest for them to do, like hiring new teachers and building new schools? 
   I am afraid some of my colleagues aren't looking for ways to answer these questions. I am afraid they just want to gut our national education partnership. 
   In this country, we already have local control over education. State and  local school districts set the curriculum. They hire the staff. States set standards and certify teachers. States and localities raise and spend 93 percent of all education funding. A lack of local control is not the problem. It is a lack of sufficient support and resources. 
   States, school districts, parents, and teachers are demanding that we, at the Federal level, work in partnership to ensure our kids get a good education. What matters to parents is that their kids get the best education possible. Parents don't care how the workload is divided. They care about results. And Democrats are focused on results. 
   One of the problems with block grants is that--in the budgeting process--they always end up getting cut because those dollars are not longer tired to a specific need. With block grants, our kids end up with fewer educational resources than they had before. In fact, we are already seeing a move underway to give our students fewer resources. 
   The Republican budget plan passed out of the House could jeopardize our ability to meet the needs in America's schools. Their plan could jeopardize our ability to keep hiring new teachers to make classrooms less crowded. They could jeopardize our ability to provide afterschool programs, to ensure safe and drug-free schools, to modernize old schools, and to build new ones. 
   Their plan could result in having $2.6 billion less for education than the President has requested. We shouldn't be shortchanging America's students, but I am concerned that is what the House Republican budget plan would do. 
   In fact, according the Congressional Budget Office, the Republican budget plan doesn't even keep up with inflation for key domestic investments, like education. 
   Parents, teachers and students in my home State--and across the country--are asking for help in education. 
   They want us to work in partnership with them to help their children reach their potential. 
   They want us to support the commonsense solutions that produce real results for our students. 
   And when they hear Members of this Congress talking about things that really don't make a difference in the classroom, they get pretty frustrated. 
   After meeting with and listening to so many frustrated parents and educators, I have come to the floor today to carry their message. 
   They want us to: Focus on what works. They want us to support the things that make a difference for children in the classroom. And they want us to work together in partnership with State and local educators to help children learn to meet the challenges of the new millennium. 
   I urge my colleagues to hear these calls loud and clear, to respond by bringing the debate here in Congress back to the realities that teachers, students and parents see in their classrooms every day across this country, and to pass a budget that follows our recipe for success by investing in the resources that every student needs. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. President, let me thank the Senator from California, Mrs. BOXER, for raising the issue that today is International Women's Day--it is a very important day for women around the world and their rights--and to thank her for her work on the resolution asking the Foreign Relations Committee to hold a hearing on CEDAW, which is a very important resolution. It is time that we as a Senate hear what is involved and have a chance to get testimony and to possibly move forward on it. It would be a great step forward.

   Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I have come to the floor this afternoon to publicly thank my colleague from the State of Washington, Mr. GORTON, for endorsing my bill, S. 2004, the Pipeline Safety Act of 2000. I am delighted Senator GORTON joined with me on this very important public safety issue. Senator GORTON has the respect of many in the Senate leadership, and I expect he will be a great help in helping us pass this pipeline safety bill. I look forward to working with him to make sure that the tragedies he talked about today--such as the one that occurred in Bellingham, WA--don't happen again. 
   I also wish to take a moment to recognize the efforts of many, many people in my home State of Washington--especially the mayor of Bellingham, Mark Asmundson, who has done more than anyone I know to raise public awareness about pipeline dangers and to call for stronger safety measures. 
   I encourage my colleagues, many of whom I have met personally over the last several months on this issue, to take this opportunity now to join Senator GORTON and me in helping to ensure the safety of the pipelines that transport natural gas, oil, and other hazardous liquids throughout our communities. 
   Since 1986, there have been more than 5,700 pipeline accidents nationwide. These accidents have killed 325 people and injured another 1,500. Three of those people died in Bellingham, WA, last June. We want to make sure we take steps this year to ensure that does not happen again to any other community. It is time to act. It is time to prevent another disaster. 
   My bill, S. 2004, would expand State authority. It would improve inspection practices, a move that is drastically needed. It would expand the public's right to know. 
   For any of you who may suffer from a disaster in the future, you will quickly find that your communities and cities won't have the ability to ask pipeline companies whether pipelines have been inspected, and what problems there are, or actions they have taken to solve those problems, unless we pass the public's ``right-to-know provision.'' It will improve the quality of pipeline operators, and it will increase funding to improve safety. 
   I look forward to working with the rest of the Washington State delegation to put the lessons that we learned all too tragically in Bellingham, WA, into law. 
   I ask my colleagues, many with whom I have met, to again take a look at this legislation and join us in sponsoring it, and for this Senate and Congress to move on this very important piece of safety legislation. 
   Thank you, Mr. President. 
   I yield the floor. 
   I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I am delighted to be on the floor with my colleague, Senator KENNEDY, to talk about an issue that many think is the most important issue facing America today. That is the issue of education. We are finally in the Senate talking about issues that are relevant to families. As they sit at the kitchen table in the evening, they, too, understand education is absolutely critical to the future of this country. 
   We are finally today with this amendment talking about a measure which will ensure that every teacher in this country is fully qualified and has the tools and the support to help our children reach their full potential. For years, parents and teachers have been asking for support on teacher quality. 
   Last year, I came to the Senate floor to introduce a bill to help recruit, retain, and reward America's best educators. I am thrilled today to discuss many of the items in that bill. I hope we will have an up-or-down vote on this amendment so families across our country can see whether or not this Senate supports quality teaching. 
   I thank the Senator from Massachusetts for helping this day become possible and by leading to make education a front and center issue in this Congress, as it is in the classrooms and homes across America. 
   Before I discuss the specifics of the amendment, I wish to make another point loudly and clearly: Today there are thousands of world-class, high-quality teachers in our schools. They are professionals. They care deeply about the quality of our children's education. Any Member would be lucky to have our children in those classrooms. 
   However, the current system makes it harder and harder for teachers to do their best. Instead of offering them the support they need to make a difference--smaller classes, classrooms that are safe, afterschool care--this current system puts too maybe roadblocks in front of too many teachers. 
   We are here today to discuss teacher quality. I want my colleagues to keep in mind that we are not criticizing teachers. They are overworked and underpaid and not given enough respect. They are, indeed, heroes. We are trying to change the system to allow more teachers to become master teachers. 
   I hope throughout this debate my colleagues will refrain from attacking the very people who try their hardest day in and day out to help our children and do the right thing for our country. As I said many times before, teachers do one of the most important jobs in America, and we should make it easier, not harder, for them to do their best. 
   The amendment from the Senator from Massachusetts could not come at a better time because there are so many challenges to quality teaching, and those challenges just keep growing. 
   Teachers and parents have told me the main challenges are the three Rs: Recruiting great teachers, retaining great teachers, and rewarding great teachers. Statistics today show we need more educators to meet our growing student population. In fact, in the United States, we are expecting to face an unprecedented teacher shortage in the next few years. The National Center for Educational Statistics estimates we will need between 1.7 to 2.7 million new teachers by the year 2008. 
   One reason not many people want to go into the teaching profession is there are not enough incentives for recent college graduates to become teachers. With the wide range of employment opportunities available to young people today, to our college graduates, teaching is not the most attractive option. The teaching profession, as we all know, is just not a lucrative place to be. In the USA Today Teacher Survey, 69 percent of teachers said most people do not consider teaching to be an attractive career choice. So we are not attracting enough talented people into the teaching profession. 
   As I am sure has happened to many of my colleagues, I have gone into a classroom and asked: How many of you young people intend to be a teacher? Very few hands go up. But if you ask those young people: How many of you would become teachers if you knew you would get the training, the support, the money, and the respect that other professionals get? A lot more hands in those classrooms go up. So our first challenge is recruiting young people into the teaching profession. That is what this amendment does. 
   Next, we need to retain great teachers. When you think about it, there really is nowhere for a great teacher to go. If they move up, they move out of the classroom into administration or into another profession. While we need great administrators, we should do everything we can to keep our really great teachers in the classrooms. We need to give our teachers options such as becoming master teachers, so they can continue to grow while helping our kids in their classrooms. 
   There are a lot of reasons for this retention problem. Unlike any other profession, teachers do not have adequate access to continuous high-quality professional development, so we need effective, ongoing professional development programs that are aligned with local standards and curricula. 
   Finally, we need to reward our good teachers. 
   Mr. President, I have come to the floor to thank Senator KENNEDY for his leadership on the most critical issue we see facing our students today--making sure every teacher in every classroom is a quality teacher. I thank my colleague from Massachusetts, and I urge my colleagues to support this critical amendment.

   Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, the Senate is currently considering the Republican education agenda. I have listened carefully to the debate over the last several days. 
   It seems to me the difference between the Democratic and Republican approaches couldn't be more clear. Democrats want to invest in policies that really make a difference for today's young people. On the other side, we are hearing the same old song and dance about tax cuts, vouchers, block grants, and savings accounts. I fear those policies will really weaken our public schools instead of strengthening them. 
   The education savings account bill we are considering today would only help a very few wealthy families at the expense of everyone else. I urge my colleagues to reject it. 
   We should be spending our limited time on the policies that parents and teachers know work--things such as smaller classes taught by fully qualified teachers. Those are the policies that time and time again have produced real results for our students --not tax schemes, not funding gimmicks, not policies that will drain money away from our public schools. 
   That is why I am here this afternoon to introduce my class size amendment which will provide real help for students across the country. 
   These education savings accounts will only help a few people with very high incomes. Unfortunately, families who aren't well off need more incentives to save for education. And this bill doesn't offer them any. For the 90 percent of Americans whose children attend public schools, this bill offers peanuts. 
   The Joint Tax Committee found that the average benefit per child in public school would be between $3 and $7 per year over 
   a 4-year period. This program is a backdoor voucher which will drain money away from our public schools and take scarce resources from students who need them most. All the while, this bill will do nothing to improve the quality of public education. 
   I know I am not the only person in America who thinks we should be investing in the things that we know work in education. A recent poll was conducted for the National Education Association by two bipartisan research firms--a Democratic research firm and a Republican research firm. It found that Americans want specific policies--policies such as providing additional support for students with special needs, policies such as helping school districts attract quality teachers, and policies such as hiring 100,000 new, fully qualified teachers to reduce class sizes in our country. Those are some of the specific, concrete policies on which the American people want us to focus. 
   In the same poll, the American public chose education as its No. 1 priority over tax cuts by a margin of two to one. 
   The bill on the floor today ignores the priorities the American people are asking us to address. 
   As a former school board member, let me give my colleagues a real-life opportunity to test this poll's funding. 
   Monday night, for many districts, is ``School Board Meeting Night'' across the country. If my colleagues want to know what the education priorities are at home, all they have to do is attend a local school board meeting. Senators will have the ability to see locally-  elected officials, respected community activists, parents, and students gather to discuss priorities and real problems. 
   School boards all across the country face very tough issues. I know what service on a school board is. I know what school boards are dealing with. They are grappling with class size, hiring quality teachers, deteriorating facilities, textbooks, curricula, and other issues. 
   I know what school boards are not dealing with. School boards are not debating tax cuts and vouchers. School boards are not considering diverting revenues from public schools to private schools. But that is what this bill would do. 
   This is the wrong education debate for our country. The right education debate gives our students the tools and the support they need to reach their full potential. Every child in America deserves a well-trained teacher and a small class size. When a student's hand goes up in the classroom, she should get the help she needs and the attention she needs. That is why this Senate should pass this class-size amendment. 
   I am offering this amendment for one reason--to continue the progress we have made in classrooms across America for the last 2 years. As a former teacher, I can tell you, it makes a difference if you have 18 kids in your classroom instead of 35. Parents know it, teachers know it, and students know it. By working together over the past 2 years, we have been able to bring real results to students. 
   This year, 1.7 million students across the country are learning in classrooms that are less crowded than the year before; 1.7 million students are in classrooms where teachers can spend more time teaching and less time dealing with discipline problems; and 1.7 million students are in classrooms where they can get the individual attention they need and where they will learn the basics. 
   That is progress. But it is not enough. There are still too many students in overcrowded classrooms. So far, we have hired 29,000 new fully qualified teachers. My class size amendment will continue our progress. 
   I recently visited a classroom in Takoma, WA, where they have taken our class size money and put it into their first grade classrooms. Now 67 classrooms in that district have 15 students in the first grade. The teachers will say they know this is the first year they will be able to say at the end of the year that every child in their first grade classroom will be able to read. There will be direct results from this program we have passed the last 2 years. They could not make those promises with 30 kids in the classroom. They now can as a result of the work we have done. 
   I wish to take a moment to go through the specifics of my amendment. This amendment uses $1.2 billion to reduce class size, particularly in the early grades, first through third, using highly qualified teachers to improve educational achievement for regular and special needs children. 
   This amendment targets the money where it is needed within the States. Within States, 100 percent of the funds go directly to local school districts on a formula which is 80 percent need-based and 20 percent enrollment based. Small school districts that alone may not generate enough Federal funding to pay for a new teacher may join together to generate enough funds to pay for a new teacher or to institute a top-notch recruiting program. 
   This amendment ensures local decisionmaking. Each local school district board makes the decisions about hiring and training their new teachers. The school district must use at least 75 percent of the funds to hire new certified teachers. 
   This amendment promotes teacher quality. Up to 25 percent of the funds may be used to test new teachers or to provide professional development to new and current teachers or of regular and special needs children. The program ensures that all teachers are fully qualified. Under the amendment, school districts hire State-certified teachers so every student will learn from a highly trained professional. 
   This amendment is flexible. Any school district that has already reduced class sizes in early grades, to 18 or fewer children, may then use the funds to further reduce class sizes in the early grades, to reduce class size in kindergarten or other grades, or carry out activities to improve teacher quality, including professional development. 
   The class size program is simple and efficient. School districts fill out a one-page form which is available online. The Department of Education sends them the money to hire the new teachers based on need and enrollment. 
   Let me add that teachers have told me they have never seen money move as quickly from Congress to the classrooms as they have under our class size bill. 
   Finally, this amendment ensures accountability. The amendment clarifies that the funds are supplementary and cannot replace current spending on teachers or teacher salaries. School districts fill out no new forms to get the funding, they just add a description of their class size reduction plan to a current form. Accountability is assured by requiring school districts to send a report card in plain English to their local community, including information about how achievement has improved as a result of reducing class size. 
   Those are the specifics of my amendment. I know this amendment will help my students. I urge my colleagues to support it.

   Mrs. MURRAY. I will just take a few minutes to wrap up and then I can yield my time. A number of Senators want to vote. They have other business to do. 
   Let me respond to the Senators from Georgia and New Hampshire. The Senator from New Hampshire is correct. We are in markup on the Elementary and Secondary Education Act in committee. Unfortunately, we just gave political speeches this morning and were not able to offer our amendments and go through that process. I know the committee intends to do that, but the majority decided what was going to be on the floor today--their education policy. This is what we are debating. This is our opportunity as Democrats to say what we believe is important. 
   We believe clearly that we have a choice. We can take very important Federal resources and offer them to families who are wealthy enough to put $2,000 away and get $3 to $7 back in a tax cut, or we can use that money for programs that we know work. 
   The Senator from New Hampshire indicated he did not believe class size reduction worked. Let me tell you two things, Mr. President. First of all, a very important study that was completed, a STAR study from Tennessee, that followed kids in the early grades, first through third grade, in small classes, and then watched their progress until they graduated a year ago, clearly found students in small classes, as we are asking this money to go for, had fewer discipline problems, graduated with higher scores in math  and English, and in much greater numbers 
   went on to college. 
   What Member of this Senate has not been out here to say those are goals every one of us has: Better discipline and higher scores in math and English and higher rates of students going on to college? That is clearly a goal for all of us in public education. It is the STAR study and other studies that have shown it works. 
   We are saying if we want to provide this money, we should do it for programs that work for kids. The mandatory provision the Senator from Georgia spoke to in the bill is, I believe, 13 lines long and merely says what this money goes for is for class size reduction with a quality teacher in every classroom. It provides some of those funds for training those teachers because that is a critical issue. I absolutely agree. 
   Finally, let me say from a personal perspective, having been in a classroom as a teacher with a large class and a small class, I can tell you what the difference is. The difference between the large class and small class is the difference between crowd control and teaching; having the time to work individually with students, to understand what their needs are, to help them get through the difficult processes of learning in the early grades: Reading, writing and math. Those are very basic skills that a child needs to have. 
   It is very clear to me we have a choice between a few families in this country who can afford to put away several thousand dollars a year and only get $3 to $7 back--a very few families--or we can use this money in a way that absolutely makes a difference in early grades for our children. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this amendment and ask them to seriously consider what education policies we believe are important for families across this country. I believe reducing class size, providing quality teachers, making sure our schools are safe, are important criteria and a responsibility for us at the Federal level, to work in partnerships with our State and local school boards to make sure every child in this country--every child, not just a few--is able to learn to read and write and be a success.

   Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I want to share with my colleagues some great education news for schools in Washington state and around the country. Today, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation announced a nationwide commitment to provide $350 million over three years to help students succeed in the classroom. 
   As a former educator in Washington state, I'm especially pleased that more than $200 million dollars will go to Washington state classrooms. This generous contribution will put money where we know it will make a difference: helping all students achieve by developing strong leadership skills in our teachers and administrators. 
   As we work here in the Senate on our national education policy, today's announcement is a reminder that educating our children is a team effort--and there are important roles for federal, state, and local officials, as well as businesses, nonprofit organizations, and individuals. 
   For years, the people I represent have seen first-hand the generosity and sense of community that Bill and Melinda Gates possess. Their foundation has worked to vaccinate poor children against diseases, to bring computers to libraries across the country, and to provide scholarships to talented minority students. We in Washington state have known about it since the beginning, and I'm proud that today, the whole nation gets to see it--and benefit from it. 
   I couldn't be more proud of the Gates Foundation on this special occasion and can't wait to see the many ways this will improve education for millions of students. 
   As we begin our work to reauthorize the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, I hope that this major announcement serves to remind us that local school districts--on their own--don't have all the resources they need. Individuals have a role to play as mentors, volunteers and coaches. Charitable foundations have a role to play, and the federal government also has a role to play. 
   I hope the Senate will follow the important and thoughtful example set by the Gates Foundation to do our best to give all students the resources and the tools they need to reach their potential.

   Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I have come to the floor today to talk about the budget the President has presented to Congress this year. Every budget is a statement of priorities, and I wanted to share with my colleagues how this budget matches up with the priorities of the people I represent. I will spend a moment talking about how we should consider budgets in this remarkable period of economic strength. 
   The President's FY 2001 budget comes at a time of great prosperity and also great challenges. I take the budget decisions we will make this year very seriously. We have an historic opportunity to meet our long-term commitments and make vital investments. In looking at the budget, I am focused on two priorities. 
   First, we cannot squander the surplus. It has been too hard to reach this point of progress. When I came to the Senate in 1993, our fiscal house was a mess. But we made the tough, fiscally responsible decisions that have brought us to this point. The surplus is not here by accident. We made very difficult choices, and now is not the time to abandon our steady, responsible approach. 
   We have a responsibility to use the surplus in ways that will meet our long-term commitments and continue our economic growth. We know that Social Security and Medicare are running out of money. These are promises from one generation to the next. And it would be wrong--fiscally and morally--not to save those programs while we have the chance. 
   We should also remember that these surplus projections are just that--protections. I worry that some of the projections my Republican colleagues have used are too rosy--in part because they are based on faulty assumptions, and they do not account for any slowing down of our economy. I think we should use the most realistic estimates available. 
   Second, we have to continue to make the responsible investments that will help our economy grow. We must maintain our investments in areas like education, R&D, infrastructure, criminal justice, agriculture, and defense. We must strengthen Social Security and Medicare. And we must provide targeted tax relief. I am pleased that the President has presented a responsible plan for meeting those objectives. 
   One important investment is paying down the debt. We are responsible for paying down a major portion of the public debt. A commitment of $2.5 trillion over ten years--as called for by the President--would make us debt free within 13 years. Mr. President, now is the time to pay down the debt--while the economy is strong. 
   I know there will be a lot of debate over tax cuts this year. There is room for tax cuts--but they need to be responsible. We should remember that just last year Republicans were pushing an irresponsible, $790 billion tax cut. I am glad the American people rejected it. And this year, some presidential candidates appear willing to roll the dice on even riskier schemes.  
   This year we should be on the look out for tax cuts that do not help our country. When looking at tax cuts, I will be asking: Do they contribute to our future and promote our economic growth by investing in workers and education? 
   I would like to turn to the investments we have to make in education. 
   When I think of the types of investments that have real returns for America's families--education tops the list. Investing in education pays dividends in boosting our country's productivity and expanding our people's potential. We must continue to invest in education so that every American will have the tools and skills to succeed in the global economy. We know that by reducing class size, investing in teacher quality, and making higher education more accessible, we are improving the prospects for our nation and our people. And I am proud of the many education investments this budget makes. 
   We must stay on the path of hiring 100,000 fully-qualified teachers to reduce class size. We know that kids learn the basics and have fewer discipline problems in smaller classes. The budget boosts funding to $1.75 billion, an increase of $450 million over the current level. That's enough to hire about 49,000 teachers, nearly half-way to our long term goal. So I commend the president's budget for its commitment to reducing class size. By working together over the past two years, we've already made the classroom a better, more productive place for 1.7 million students--and with the President's latest commitment, we can bring the benefits of smaller classes to many more students. 
   We know that when we reduce the number of students in each classroom--we need more classrooms, so I am pleased the President's budget also follows through on our efforts to boost school construction. 
   The President's budget also takes greats steps forward to improve teacher quality. As I listened to the President's State of the Union Address last month, I was excited to see that efforts to boost teacher quality are finally getting the national attention they deserve. 
   We need to have a plan to recruit, train and reward great teachers; a plan to help high-poverty school districts attract great teachers through better pay and higher standards; and a plan to reward school districts that make progress in reducing the number of uncertified teachers and teachers teaching outside their subject area. These would all represent great steps forward. 
   We need to boost hometown teacher recruitment, to help professionals from diverse fields make the transition to the classroom, and to promote professional development for school leaders. 
   But there is more we should do to boost teacher quality. That's why, last year, I introduced the Quality and Accountability are Best for Children Act--Quality ABCs (S. 1926). After talking with parents, teachers and students, I wrote a bill that will hold educators accountable for their students' progress. It will help keep great teachers in the classroom by offering them improved professional development and career ladders. It will reward and recognize great educators. It will offer a meaningful financial bonus for states to improve teacher pay and it will ensure teachers have the training they need to use technology in the classroom. 
   I believe the President's budget--and his State of the Union Address--are a great start to boosting teacher quality across America. 
   The President's budget also makes important investments in early education, in Headstart funding, in preventing youth violence, and in expanding college access. 
   Mr. President, clearly this is a budget that recognizes the importance of education. It matches our funding with our priorities. 
   But there are some initiatives that do not require a budget allocation. And I would like to spend a moment highlighting some of the efforts I will fight for as we reauthorize the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. 
   First, there is a lot we can do to boost parental involvement. Parents are a child's first and best teachers, and studies have shown that when families are involved in education their children do better in school. Today, it is difficult for parents and family members to participate in their children's education--either because they do not feel welcomed by schools or because their time is limited by work and other constraints. 
   That is why I've introduced two bills to make it easier for parents to help their children succeed in school. 
   First, I introduced the Time for Schools Act, S. 1304, which allows parents to take up to 24 hours of unpaid leave from work each year to attend academic events at school. 
   And second, with input from parents and teachers, I wrote the Parent-Family School Partnership Act, S. 1772, which will encourage families to participate in schools, will train educators in the best ways to involve parents, will invest in family involvement efforts, and will use technology and community college partnerships to boost parental involvement. 
   A great classroom and a great teacher only go so far, these bills will go a long way to ensuring that students get the most from school by having a parent involved. 
   We should also do more to expand technology in the classroom. In 1997, we made sure that new teachers get the technology training they need before they enter the classroom. This year, we should work to make sure that current teachers receive technology training as part of an on-going professional development. That effort is part of my ``Quality ABCs'' bill that I just referred to. 
   And I support increasing resources for, and access to, education technology, improving coordination and effective uses of education technology--including distance learning and advanced placement services. And finally, protecting students from inappropriate material on the Internet. 
   We should offer students a voice in education decisions. I have always believed that young people should have a role in the decisions that affect them. That's why I introduced the ``Youth and Adult School Partnership Act,'' S. 1773, which will create more meaningful roles for students in their schools and communities, invest in successful student-adult partnerships, and continue researching the link between student involvement and student achievement. 
   Finally, we should promote the types of local partnerships that help students succeed. As I have visited schools throughout my State, I have been impressed by how well they have formed partnerships with local business and non-profit organizations. I visited one community, where the local chamber of commerce runs a Teacher Internship Program--where teachers spend their summers in the business world--seeing--first-hand--the skills their students will need. And those efforts can have great results for our students. So we must continue to promote these local partnerships. 
   I have laid out my vision--the Democratic vision--for how we can improve public education. I have been working on this for many years, and it seems that the response from the other side is always ``Schools are failing, and local control is the answer.'' 
   Education in our country is already under local control. I served on a local school board, and I can tell you that as a fact. Do we need to reduce paperwork? Yes. Do we need to be more flexible? Yes. But the real question is: What are we doing to support education? This budget--and the ideas I just mentioned--offer a specific blueprint--for how we can improve education. 
   I fear that instead of giving these tools to our educators, the majority would rather criticize our public schools. 
   Too often, their rhetoric tears down, when we should be building up. The majority's education agenda too often resembles an effort to assign blame. I believe a better approach--the Democratic approach--is to strengthen the partnerships that improve education. 
   We Democrats--in the Senate and the House along with the President--are offering something positive--and I hope that this agenda of excellence is greeted by honest examination and constructive debate focused on helping students learn--and not the usual partisan blame game. 
   We have a chance to lead. We have a chance to really improve public education for all Americans. Let's not  abandon the principles that have made our nation great. Let's not let partisan gamesmanship stand in the way of progress. Let's take this unprecedented opportunity in our nation's history to make the investments we need, and to do right by our nation's parents, our nation's educators, and--most importantly--our nation's future--the children attending our public schools. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, let me assure my colleagues, this issue is not about theater. It is about the very real issue of violence against women. I join with my colleague, the Senator from New York, and thank him for his work on this amendment and urge my colleagues to support it. 
   This amendment is not about abortion. This amendment is about violence against women. We cannot allow violent extremists to use the bankruptcy code to carry out their agenda of violence. 
   If anyone thinks this is simply another abortion or choice issue, let me point out to all of you, there are groups and individuals who teach violent protesters how to protect their financial assets in the event of a civil or criminal penalty. There are classes one can take or pamphlets one can read spelling out how violent protesters can get around any punitive financial damage by simply running to bankruptcy court. 
   It is simply beyond comprehension how we can allow those convicted of violence and intimidation to be excused from punitive financial penalties. If we are serious about reducing violence and sending the right message to our children, we must support the Schumer amendment. 
   In 1998, there were two murders and one attempted murder of clinic workers. Since 1990, abortion clinic arson and bombings have resulted in over $8.5 million in damages. Two bombs were recently discovered at clinics in Kentucky and Ohio. Every day, women are harassed and intimidated as they seek proper health care services. This violence must stop, and those responsible must be held accountable. 
   Passage of the Schumer amendment will send the message that violence will not be tolerated. Peaceful protests will continue. Each individual has a right to freely express their views and their opinions. But no one has a right to carry out a campaign of fear and violence. 
   For too many women, these clinics are their only access to health care, including cancer screening and prenatal care. Constant and violent threats diminish access to health care for hundreds of women and subject them to unreasonable abuse and intimidation. Do not reward those who seek to deny women access to legal, affordable health care services. 
   Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to do the right thing and support the Schumer amendment. 
   I yield back my time to the Senator from New York.

   Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I come to the floor today as part of my on-going work to ensure that the city of Seattle gets the money it should receive for security costs incurred during the 1999 World Trade Organization Ministerial. 
   Mr. President, I have been working with the city of Seattle, the administration, and others on this issue for more than a year and let me say that I welcome Senator GORTON's interest in this topic earlier today. 
   Actually, back in 1994, I worked to resolve a similar problem associated with Seattle's hosting of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation forum. In 1994, working with the Clinton administration, we were able to provide the  city of Seattle with close to $1 million for APEC related costs. 
   Mr. President, for the record, I want to walk my colleagues through some of the history of the issue of the funding of the WTO that was discussed on the floor earlier today. 
   From the moment Seattle was awarded the WTO Ministerial meeting, I worked with the city of Seattle and others to ensure Seattle was given an opportunity to successfully host the WTO. For almost a year, I met with the city, the Seattle Host Organization, our Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky and others within the executive branch. At every opportunity, I stressed the importance of supporting the city of Seattle in its efforts to provide the necessary security arrangements to the delegates and other WTO visitors. 
   The Clinton administration--in its fiscal year 2000 budget--requested $2 million in State Department money for WTO related expenses. This request was formulated months before a U.S. host city for the WTO was selected. From the very beginning, the Washington congressional delegation and WTO organizers in Washington state realized this request would be inadequate. 
   Beginning in March of 1999, with my appropriations request letter to the Commerce, Justice, State appropriations subcommittee, I encouraged the Congress to provide $5 million to the State Department for WTO related expenses. And I urged the Congress to essentially earmark one-half of this money for Seattle to meet a portion of the WTO security expenses. 
   The Senate Commerce, Justice, State bill did provide the State Department with $5 million for WTO related expenses, but the House version did not. During the conference report, I worked with my Washington state congressional colleagues to protect the $5 million in new WTO money. 
   Unfortunately, the original CJS conference report did not provide new money. Instead, it said the State Department could take up to $5 million for existing accounts and move them over to be used for WTO expenses. 
   When I saw that language, I was concerned. To me, it increased the likelihood that the State Department would not assist Seattle with WTO security related costs. Fortunately, as often happens with appropriations bills, the final product is a compromise between the Congress and the administration. 
   On several occasions, I continued to express to the administration the need for securing $5 million in new money--rather than relying on the State Department to move old money around. 
   Mr. President, I asked unanimous consent to print in the RECORD a letter dated September 28, 1999.

   Mrs. MURRAY. This letter was written to the Commerce, Justice, State Appropriations Committee and in close consultation with WTO organizers in Seattle, including the City of Seattle. Unfortunately, despite efforts by my office and the City of Seattle, no other Senators signed the letter urging the Appropriations Committee to provide the WTO funding, as well as earmark funds for the City of Seattle. 
   I worked to make it a bipartisan letter. Perhaps if other Senators had signed the letter when I asked last year, we would have been able to provide earmark money for Seattle and avoid part of the problem now facing my state, as was discussed by my colleague from Washington earlier today. 
   The WTO was a difficult period for my constituents. We are continuing to deal with the many issues raised for our state during the ministerial. The city of Seattle and other local governments have been forced to bear $12 million in security costs. this is a far higher cost than anyone anticipated. It threatens to force other budget cuts to make up for the State Department's refusal to work with my constituents. 
   Congress--with strong assistance from the President and Vice President--did provide $5 million in WTO money. The issue before us now is between my constituents--who have been asked to absorb virtually all WTO security costs--and the State Department. 
   Obviously, this issue will not go away. And I have already begun to work with the administration to get further support in forcing the State Department to assume some responsibility for the $12 million in WTO security costs. 
   Now is not the time for the State Department to discredit or deny the legitimate issues raised by my constituents. And now is not the time to politicize an issue that remains difficult and volatile for my constituents. Seattle and Washington state want to heal the WTO wounds 
   This administration has been enormously helpful to Washington state interests. Across the board, the President and the Vice President, have both devoted time, energy and resources to Washington state's problems fighting for jobs for aerospace workers, supporting our high tech economy, devoting new resources to environmental problems, and addressing our difficult transportation problems are all examples of the close working relationship between this administration and Washington state. 
   And I expect the same degree of support in trying to resolve the current problem on WTO security related costs incurred by the city of Seattle and other local governments in Washington state. 
   Mr. President, I encourage my colleagues to join me in working with the administration to address this very difficult problem. The best way to do this is through cooperation--by trying to convince the State Department that in hosting international events, we must be careful not to ask local governments to assume costs that are clearly federal responsibilities. 
   Mr. President, I will continue my efforts to ensure that the city of Seattle and other local governments are not left holding the bag, and once again, I welcome my colleagues to join me in this effort.

    Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I come to the floor today to recognize the Weyerhaeuser Company's 100th anniversary on Tuesday, January 18, 2000. 
   In 1990, a group of investors led by Frederick Weyerhaeuser incorporated the Weyerhaeuser Company. With three employees in Tacoma, Washington, Weyerhaeuser began one hundred years of expansion and growth across our State, Nation and international borders. Today, Weyerhaeuser is the world's largest owner of softwood timber, and the largest producer and distributor of engineered wood products. 
   An economic pillar in the Northwest and throughout the nation, Weyerhaeuser employs over 45,000 people. The company's current success is directly related to its commitment to sustainable forestry and community involvement. Frederick Weyerhaeuser's founding vision is captured in his statement ``this is not for us, it is for our children.'' Steven R. Rogel, Weyerhaeuser's current chairman, CEO, and president has committed the company to ``safety and to being a good corporate citizen. Weyerhaeuser continues to manage woodlands to sustain the supply of wood and protect the ecosystem.'' Through product research, Weyerhaeuser has successfully developed new products and services to meet changing customer demands. 
   Dedicated to the communities which support it, Weyerhaeuser has distributed over $127 million to communities for educational, environmental and other programs. Through the years, Weyerhaeuser has supported recycling programs becoming the third largest recycler in the Nation. The company's 24 recycling facilities collect nearly four million tons of paper each year. In 1980, Mt. St. Helens in Washington state erupted, destroying thousands of acres of forest. Weyerhaeuser salvaged timber and replanted 18 million seedlings in the volcanic area. The company joined the Department of Transportation to create the visitor center at Mt. St. Helens which educates people about the environment. 
   Over the years, Weyerhaeuser has become an international trade leader and an engine adding to the economic success of Washington state and the entire nation. I would like to congratulate the Weyerhaeuser Team on its past 100 years of business success. I know their innovation will carry them through the next century, and I look forward to the benefits Weyerhaeuser will continue to bring to the people of Washington State.

    Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, it is with great respect and admiration that I rise today to pay tribute to Ms. Hazel Wolf, of Seattle, Washington, who passed away at the age of 101 on Wednesday, January 19, 2000. A tireless advocate for conservation and social justice, Ms. Wolf was an outstanding example for all Americans. She combined humor with persistence as she set about combating injustice. She will continue to live in the hearts and minds of the many who knew her. And there are many, for Hazel had the remarkable ability to engage just about anyone, from Senator to second grader. 
   Hazel Wolf was born in Victoria, British Columbia, on March 10, 1898. In 1923, she moved to the United States with her daughter, Nydia. She was a union organizer for the Works Progress Administration and avidly followed politics, eventually becoming a Democrat. Until 1965, she worked as a legal secretary for the Seattle civil rights lawyer John Caughlan. It wasn't until her retirement that she became such an involved environmental activist and leader. 
   Ms. Wolf began working with the Audubon Society in the early-1960s and helped start 21 of the 26 Audubon Society chapters in Washington State. In 1979, she worked to organize the first statewide conference to bring together environmentalists and Native American tribes, the Indian Conservationist Conference. She served as Secretary of the Seattle Audubon Society chapter for three decades, and for 17 years she edited an environmental newsletter, `Outdoors West'. In 1990, her discussions with a Soviet delegation led to the creation of the Leningrad Audubon Society in Russia. Ms. Wolf was also a founder of Seattle's Community Coalition for Environmental Justice, which works to improve environmental safety in poor city neighborhoods. She also belonged to the Sierra Club, Greenpeace and the Earth Island Institute. Ms. Wolf was a frequent and favorite speaker at schools and environmental conferences throughout the Northwest. 
   In 1997, the National Audubon Society awarded her the prestigious Audubon Medal, for Excellence in Environmental Achievement. She received numerous other awards, including the State of Washington Environmental Excellence Award, the National Audubon Society's Conservationist of the Year Award and the Washington State Legislature Award for environmental work. To celebrate her 100th birthday in 1998, the Seattle Audubon chapter created the Hazel Wolf ``Kids for the Environment'' endowment, which will fund programs to provide urban children from lower-income communities with opportunities to experience the natural world. In Issaquah, Washington, there is a 116-acre wetland named after her. On the other side of the Cascade Mountains near Yakima, a bird sanctuary bears her name. 
   Hazel Wolf served as the environmental conscience of the Northwest, with her dedication to protecting forests, saving salmon, educating young people and preserving the outdoors for future generations to enjoy. The most significant and important tribute we can give to Hazel Wolf is to continue the work which she pursued with such vision and passion. We will miss you Hazel, but rest assured, we will continue the work you started.

   Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, at the start of this session, I've come to the floor to introduce a bill that will improve the safety of all Americans by raising the safety standards on the oil and gas pipelines that run through our communities. 
   Today, I'm introducing the Pipeline Safety Act of 2000. 
   Until recently, like many Americans, I wasn't aware of the potential safety hazards that pipelines can pose. These pipelines stretch across America--running under our homes and near our schools and offices. Nationwide, the Office of Pipeline Safety oversees more than 157,000 miles of underground pipeline which transport hazardous liquids and more than 2.2 million miles of pipeline which transport natural gas. They perform a vital service--bringing oil and essential products to our homes and businesses. I rarely heard about them, so I assumed they were safe. 
   But last year, there was a deadly pipeline accident in my home state of Washington. And the more I learned about how pipelines are regulated in the United States--the more concerned I became. 
   Today, seven months after that disaster in Bellingham, I am here on the Senate floor with a bill that takes the lessons of pipeline disasters and turns them into law--so that these tragedies won't happen again. 
   Mr. President, on June 10th, in Bellingham, Washington, a gas pipeline ruptured--releasing more than a quarter of a million gallons of gasoline into Whatcom Creek. The gas ignited--sending a huge fireball racing down the creek--destroying everything in its path for more than a mile. The dramatic explosion killed three young people who happened to be playing by the creek. It created a plume of smoke which rose more than twenty-thousand feet into the air. 
   This photo behind me was taken just moments after the explosion. One minute, a quiet residential area; the next moment, a disaster. 
   Besides the tragic loss of these three young lives, this explosion caused horrendous environmental damage. In fact, I was scheduled to be at this exact site just a few weeks later to designate a newly restored salmon spawning ground. When I saw the damage a short time after the explosion, frankly, I was shocked. 
   Take a look at these pictures. This was before the explosion where we were going to dedicate a salmon creek spawning ground. This is afterwards. As you can see, this explosion destroyed all of the plant and animal life in the creek, and it was once a lush and diverse habitat. In moments, it was destroyed and gone. 
   The explosion also had an impact on the entire community. Neighbors could not sleep at night, and young children--still to this day--panic during lightning storms. And, of course, three  families--who lost their children--will never be the same. 
   Mr. President, as I researched this issue, I learned that what happened in my state was not unique--in fact--it wasn't even rare. According to the Office of Pipeline Safety, since 1986, there have been more than 5,500 incidents, resulting in 310 deaths and 1,500 injuries. Those 5,500 incidents also caused nearly a billion dollars in property damage. On average, our nation suffers one pipeline accident every day. 
   Clearly, this is a national problem--requiring a national solution. This chart shows some of the major pipeline accidents since 1981. This chart only shows the accidents investigated by the National Transportation Safety Board--not all 5,500. 
   As you can see, these disasters can occur anywhere--in anyone's neighborhood, in anyone's community, close to anybody's school, near anybody's place of work. And they have devastating results. 
   While the pipeline industry--by and large--does a good job of safely delivering the fuel we need to heat our homes and drive our cars, there are some examples where they failed to protect the public. 
   According to a New York Times article from January 14th of this year:  
   One of the nation's largest pipeline operators quit inspecting its lines for much of the 1990's and instead found flaws by waiting for the pipes to break. Koch Industries agreed to pay a fine of $30 million--the largest civil environmental penalty to date.  
   That company's behavior resulted in leaks of three million gallons of crude oil, gasoline, and other products in 300 separate incidents in the last nine years. 
   We can't just rely on the industry to police itself. As this example showed, one company decided it was cheaper to wait for accidents to happen, than to take steps to prevent them. The time has come to raise the standards for pipeline safety. 
   Too often the public is left in the dark. Neighbors don't know they live near pipelines. Schools and communities aren't told when there are problems with a pipeline. The time has come to expand the public's right to know about the pipelines that run near their homes. 
   Too often pipelines operators don't have the training or experience they need to handle emergencies. Sometimes their actions cause accidents, and many times they make these disasters even worse. We should certify pipeline inspectors so we will know they have the training they need. In fact, in 1992 Congress passed a law requiring certification of pipeline operators. But a few years later, that requirement was repealed. That's a mistake we need to correct, and today, the need for qualified, certified operators is even greater. 
   Too often there aren't enough resources to oversee the industry or to carry out vital safety programs. The time has come to put the resources behind these new standards. 
   The time has come to reduce the risks pipeline pose. And the bill I'm introducing today does just that. 
   Here are the key provisions of my bill: 
   First, my bill will expand state authority to give states more control over pipeline safety standards. It's time to make states equal partners when it comes to pipeline safety. States should be able to use their knowledge of local conditions and circumstances to increase safety. States should be able to set up even more stringent standards than the federal government in areas like: 
   Requiring additional training and education of inspectors and operators; 
   Allowing states to require additional leak detection devices; 
   Allowing states to certify procedures and responses to accidents; and 
   Allowing states to enforce regulations. 
   While some new state authority gives the Secretary of Transportation the discretion to allow states to regulate, it is my intent that the Secretary work aggressively at accomplishing these partnerships in the way I outline in my bill. 
   I also strongly support efforts to better equip states as they respond to accidents. This involves better coordination between state and federal agencies so that police, fire, and emergency medical personnel will be better able to respond to pipeline disasters. The federal government should also encourage states to work more closely with pipeline companies on prevention. 
   Second, my bill will improve inspection practices. 
   We must develop guidelines and requirements for the internal and external inspection of pipelines. Current law only requires that pipelines be inspected internally when they are new and being used for the first time. 
   My bill requires pipeline companies to periodically inspect their pipelines internally and externally and report their findings to federal and state authorities, as well as the public. My bill also requires pipeline companies to take action if those findings uncover problems. 
   Third, my bill will strengthen the public's ``right to know.'' 
   Currently the public does not have the right to know about spills and problems with pipelines. My bill would require pipeline companies to disclose problems with the pipeline and what the company is doing to fix them. It will require pipeline companies to report to the public any spill and also to report the results of the periodic testing I am proposing. 
   Fourth, my bill will improve the quality of pipeline operators. 
   Current law allows companies to determine if their own operator is ``qualified'' to work on a pipeline. My bill would place the government in the position of determining whether the companies' assessment is accurate. We wouldn't want an airline pilot flying a plane unless the FAA determined he was qualified. Similarly, we should require the Office of Pipeline Safety to review and certify the qualifications of pipeline operators. 
   Finally, my bill will increase funding to improve safety. 
   We should increase funding for research that will help improve the devices that inspect pipelines and detect leads. We should also increase grant programs to state agencies that regulate and monitor pipelines. This should be a partnership that recognizes both the state and federal responsibility in making pipelines safer. 
   Mr. President, I am proud to introduce this bill today because I know it's the right thing to do. This has been a long process, and I've received a lot of cooperation. Specifically, I would like to thank U.S. Secretary of Transportation Rodney Slater, the Office of Pipeline Safety, the National Transportation Safety Board, the City of Bellingham, my colleagues in the Senate, Gov. Locke, other federal and state agencies, and industry representatives. Senator GORTON, my colleague from Washington State, is well aware of the importance of this issue and I look forward to his continued input. 
   I'm also looking forward to working with my colleagues in the House--specifically Representatives INSLEE, METCALF, and BAIRD--who have expressed interest in this issue. 
   This bill will raise safety standards so that every family that lives near a pipeline can sleep soundly at night. This accident should not happen again. The time has come to take the lessons of this tragedy and put them into law--so we can reduce the odds of another disaster. We have a responsibility to do it, this bill gives us the tools to do it, and I hope you will support me in this effort.

   Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, as the Senate finally concludes its work for the legislative year, I want to outline my position on a few of the final issues. Unfortunately, I needed to travel back to Washington state to attend the funeral of my good friend and mentor, Pat McMullen, and missed three votes. 
   Before leaving, I voted in favor of the ``motion to proceed'' to the omnibus appropriations bill, which also included fixes to the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 and the tax extenders package. With that vote, I registered my support for this important funding and corrections bill. I also would have voted in favor of the Work Incentives Act. 
   First, I would like to address just some important provisions in the omnibus appropriations bill. There are many things that we do here that have little direct impact on the lives of real people and real families. However, this legislation is one of those times when we act to provide real help and real hope to working families, children and our senior citizens. 
   The package that we are about to enact, provides an additional $2 billion  investment in the National Institutes of Health (NIH). There are few people in this country who are not touched in some way by the research supported by NIH. An additional $2 billion keeps us on track to doubling our investment in medical research. Research that saves lives and prevents human suffering. Our investment has already brought us closer to finding a cure for devastating diseases like Parkinson's, leukemia, heart disease, and breast cancer. We must continue this commitment as this investment is about saving dollars and lives. The impact on Washington state is also significant. I am proud of the fact that Washington state is one of the top recipients of NIH grants. The outstanding research being conducted at research institutions like the University of Washington and the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center are known throughout the world. We are truly a world leader in medical research. 
   This appropriations package will also provide additional resources to improve access to quality health care for the uninsured and the most vulnerable. The additional funding for the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and the additional $100 million provided for Community Health and Migrant Health Care Centers provide a critical health care safety net for those working families who simply cannot afford insurance. There are more than 80 clinics in Washington state providing quality, affordable health care services who will be able to expand and meet the growing needs of the uninsured populations. 
   I am pleased we have been successful in providing, for the first time, a direct appropriation to support poison control efforts and education and training for Children's Hospitals. I have been a long time proponent of these efforts and recognize the importance of this investment in our children. 
   Overall, this appropriations package includes a $34.5 billion investment in health care programs. This investment will strengthen the public health infrastructure, provide essential prevention and treatment services to individuals with mental illness and ensure that our senior 
   citizens are not forgotten. The additional $45 million provided to support Older Americans Act programs ensures that we can honor our commitment to our nation's elderly by providing important services like nutritional assistance, employment training, respite care, in-home care, and abuse prevention. 
   In addition, as part of this appropriations bill, we have succeeded in saving quality health care for millions of Medicare beneficiaries. The corrections to the Balanced Budget Act address the unintended consequences of the reductions called for in 1997. Then, we anticipated a total of $100 billion over five years to ensure Medicare's solvency. Unfortunately, our estimates have proven incorrect and we were facing well over $200 billion in reductions which are impacting quality care for millions of seniors and the disabled. The BBA97 corrections provide additional resources for home health care, skilled nursing facilities, nursing homes, hospitals, cancer treatment centers, teaching hospitals like the University of Washington, community health care centers, rehabilitation services, and health maintenance organizations. This one time correction will prevent the closing of facilities or home health care agencies and does not jeopardize our goal of solvency for the Medicare Trust Fund. I know from my own health care providers and my own hospitals what this fix means. I also know that without it, rural health care was in real jeopardy. I told my constituents that I would not leave for the year until we acted to address the looming crisis. This has been accomplished in a bipartisan and comprehensive manner. 
   I would also like to address the tax extenders package included in this bill. I generally support the tax extenders package. It includes the expansion of some tax credits that I have strongly supported over the years. First, the research and experimentation tax credit represents a critical investment for our nation. If we are to continue creating more and higher-paying jobs for American workers, we must encourage the business community to invest in research and development. This bill does just that. I have cosponsored two bills to make the R&E tax credit permanent, so I look forward to working with my colleagues to make that happen. 
   I am also pleased this legislation includes extensions of the Welfare-to-Work Tax Credit and the Work Opportunity Tax Credit, which help us move toward our goal of ensuring that all Americans benefit from the new economy. 
   This extenders package also includes an extension of employer provided educational assistance. I am disappointed the package does not include compensation for graduate school assistance. I believe this commission is short-sighted. At a time when the American economy is so rapidly changing, we need to ensure that our workforce is able to meet the demands of the new economy. 
   Our tax code should also reflect our commitment to cleaner energy. While this package extends the wind and biomass tax credit, it does not expand the definition of biomass to include open loop biomass. Meanwhile, it expands the code to include incentives for the production of energy from chicken waste. I have no doubt that some of my colleagues are trying to address legitimate animal waste issues in their states. However, if the code is to be expanded, it should be expanded to include open loop biomass. If Congress considers major tax legislation next year, this should be a top priority. 
   While the efforts I have mentioned above help businesses and the poor, the bill also helps middle class Americans. In 1997, we passed important non-refundable tax credits, like the child tax credit, that have greatly benefitted the middle class. This legislation will ensure families can continue to use these credits without being affected by the alternative minimum tax. 
   Finally, the Senate passed another piece of important legislation today: the Work Incentives Act. The WIA bill rewards those disabled individuals who want to go back to work but face the prospect of falling off the so called ``health care cliff.'' We have been successful in treating many illnesses and injuries that once permanently disabled workers. They may not be cured but can be productive. Unfortunately, if they do try and return to work they lose their link to life, their health insurance. This legislation, of which I am proud to have been an original cosponsor, will allow workers to return to work and continue to receive Medicare. It will also allow many to buy-in to Medicaid. This legislation is not just about giving people the chance to return to some kind of productive life. It is about saving precious dollars as well. Workers who give up their Social Security disability payments to go back to work will be paying taxes and contributing to the Social Security and Medicare Trust Fund. This is a win-win for all of us. It is also the kind of policy that simply makes sense. People should not be penalized for trying to go back to work. 
   Mr. President, I have voted in support of the motion to proceed to this omnibus appropriations, B.B.A. of '97, and tax extenders package. I am particularly pleased we have been able to secure yet another year of commitment to our children by helping reduce class sizes in the early grades. I will be working hard to ensure this important program is authorized in the Elementary and Secondary Education Act next year. I must also note extreme disappointment in the decision to pit United Nations dues against women's reproductive health care. I remain committed to family planning throughout the world and will be working with the administration to ensure the United States continues to lead the way in protecting women's health, including our reproductive health.

   Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise today with Senators CRAIG, SMITH of Oregon, BOXER, and FEINSTEIN to introduce the Agricultural Market Access and Development Act. 
   Mr. President, farmers and ranchers in our nation are hurting. Rural communities in my home state of Washington have been severely impacted by the current crisis in agriculture. The causes are complex and diverse, and have been discussed at great length on the floor of the United States Senate. Low prices, the loss of markets in Asia, foreign trade barriers, dumping, and industry concentration are just a few of the difficulties farmers and ranchers, the Administration, and Members of Congress are struggling to overcome. 
   I am pleased Congress acted to provide emergency assistance as part of the fiscal year 2000 agriculture appropriations act. However, while this package was desperately needed, it left  our many so-called ``minor crop'' producers across the country. It failed to reform our nation's plicy on unilateral sanctions. And it didn't compel us to dedicate time to really resolve long-term issues that will put American agriculture on a more solid foundation. One long-term issue that deserves attention is federal support for market access and development. 
   Today, I am introducing the Agricultural Market Access and Development Act to ensure our producers have the resources they need to expand their overseas markets. My bill would authorize the Secretary of Agriculture to spend up to $200 million--but not less than the current $90 million--for the Market Access Program. And it would set a floor of $35 million for spending on the foreign Market Development ``Cooperator'' Program. 
   While many Members of Congress and producers have advocated increased funding for MAP and the Cooperator Program, these efforts have been complicated by our work to balance the budget and meet other important national commitments. At the same time, the agricultural community is frustrated over the use--or lack of use--of the Export Enhancement Program. 
   Debate will continue on the merits of using the Export Enhancement Program. Nevertheless, I believe we cannot afford to continue wasting the precious dollars we target toward agricultural trade. That is exactly what is happening now: hundreds of millions of dollars in the Export Enhancement Program remain unspent and unused while foreign governments heavily subsidize and protect their agricultural economies to the detriment of American producers. 
   My bill seeks to recover some of our lost trade resources and convert them into new opportunities for our farmers and ranchers. My bill would give the Secretary of Agriculture the authority to direct a percentage of unspent Export Enhancement Program dollars to market access and development programs within the Commodity Credit Corporation. If less than 20 percent of funds authorized for the Export Enhancement Program are spent by July 1 of a given fiscal year, the Secretary could direct up to 50 percent of unspent EEP funds to other programs. If less than 50 percent--but more than 20 percent--of funds authorized for EEP are spent by July 1 of a 
   given fiscal year, the Secretary could direct up to 20 percent of unspent EEP funds to other programs. 
   Mr. President, I am introducing this legislation today to advance the discussion on using all of our trade resources. The numbers included in my bill will be subject to further discussion and I welcome it. However, I believe this legislation represents a serious effort to use our scarce resources wisely. 
   Our current trade negotiations on agriculture show that we must be willing and able to use federal resources to promote trade. If we do not, our negotiations and our producers cannot succeed. 
   As we head into the Seattle Round of the World Trade Organization this fall, we need to commit ourselves to promoting trade and expanding market access. Without this commitment, we will lose opportunities to market our products overseas. Without this commitment, the changes we made to our farm policy in 1996 will not have a chance in the world of succeeding. 
   As I said before, Mr. President, agricultural producers in my state of Washington are hurting. My state is home to more than 200 ``minor'' crops. Washington state is known for its productive apple industry. Unfortunately, that industry is in the midst of a terrible economic crisis. The loss of markets in Asia, non-frozen apple juice concentrate dumping by China, oversupply, poor weather conditions in 1998, and generally low prices are driving hundreds of family farms out of business. 
   This Congress needs to do a better job of addressing the plight of all commodity producers, not just those who grow major commodities. My legislation is a step in the right direction. It seeks to increase funding for the Market Access Program, which is popular among fruit and vegetable growers. In fact, it is one of the few federal programs that benefit fruit and vegetable producers. Since this Congress has shown its reluctance to target meaningful federal aid to minor crop producers, the least we can do is strengthen the voluntary programs that work for these producers. If we do not, we will be failing to promote economic stability in many rural communities. 
   However, my bill is not just intended to help fruit and vegetable producers. It also encourages transferring unused trade dollars to the Foreign Market Development Program, which is used by program commodities. Both MAP and FMD represent the kind of federal-industry partnerships we should be encouraging at a time of limited government resources. 
   Mr. President, let me briefly address one criticism of the Market Access Program: the issue of whether it is primarily a program that benefits large corporations. Congress reformed MAP--known before the 1996 farm bill as the Market Promotion Program--in 1996 to ensure that large corporations with no connections to producers could not access MAP funds. I strongly supported that change. 
   The new law did allow for the program's continued use by farmers' cooperatives, some of which are major industry players. However, it is clear to me, and to others who follow the farm economy, that encouraging the development of farmers' cooperatives is one of the few bright spots in our efforts to keep family farms on the land. Therefore, while opponents will continue to point to a few examples of entities they believe in no way should be involved in the program, I believe my colleagues should keep the broader picture in mind. MAP deserves our support. 
   Next year, Congress should address long-term agricultural issues. And one of those issues should be the transfer of unused Export Enhancement Program funds to market access and development programs. I urge my colleagues to join me in this effort.

   Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, today I introduce legislation on another topic I will be discussing with Chairman JEFFORDS as we move forward with reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act in the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee. 
   I am introducing legislation today to fund an innovative book distribution  program targeted at giving low-income students their own ``first book.'' 
   The ``First Book'' program is a non-profit private organization that has been tremendously successful gathering and distibuting new children's books to needy children throughout the nation. Key to the success of ``First Book'' are local boards called ``First Book Local Advisory Boards.'' Under my legislation, which would provide $5 million a year federal investment to such boards, will help them leverage millions more in funds from other sources. ``First Book'' has been successful because it is locally-driven, and reflects private industry initiative. ``First Book'' provides new books, which the program purchases from publishers at discount rates, to disadvantaged children and families primarily through tutoring, mentoring, and family literacy programs. 
   This bill builds on successful efforts underway in communities across the country. It takes what has been a successful but very targeted program, and will increase its reach and effect into many more American communities. ``First Book'' makes a very real difference for disadvantaged children and their families, and with this investment, it will make a difference for thousands more.

    Mrs. MURRAY. 
   Mr. President, today I introduce legislation on another topic I will be discussing with Chairman JEFFORDS as we move forward with reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act in the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee. 
   The bill deals with an improvement I hope we can make in the Stuart McKinney Homeless Education program. While the McKinney program is relatively small, my hope is that we can greatly improve its effectiveness by recognizing and funding innovative approaches for serving homeless students. 
   Chairman JEFFORDS and others have recognized that keeping a homeless child in their school district of origin is vital to their success. Children, especially homeless children, need continuity in their lives. Yet as a nation, we have not yet focused on funding the innovative practices that will show how this can be done and done effectively. 
   In addition, there are chronic problems facing homeless children, such as the problems of trying to reach out to unaccompanied homeless youth, those young people who do not have parents or guardians with them in their homeless situation. Homeless preschoolers present another whole range of issues that many schools struggle to overcome. 
   My legislation will provide $2 million each year in national competitive challenge grants for innovation in the education of homeless children and youth. We follow this same approach in education technology and other areas, and challenge grants are remarkably successful in sparking innovation and dissemination of new methods of instruction. 
   Homeless students face many challenges, and schools face challenges in serving them. Creating a small challenge grant for homeless education is one necessary step we can take to help schools help these students succeed and achieve.

   Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise this evening in very strong support of my friend Ronald Gould's confirmation to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. This has been a long hard-fought battle and I commend him for his patience, perseverance, and persistence. We made it, Ron. Congratulations! 
   Let me share with my colleagues some of the special things about Ronald Gould that make him a person I was proud to recommend to the President for a seat on the Federal bench. He has personally supported me in my political career and helped others to believe in me. Ron is an excellent lawyer, a strong advocate for the legal profession, a community booster, a dedicated family man, a Distinguished Eagle Scout, and a man who has overcome much in his personal life to continue to be all of these things. I am honored to have been a part of his journey to the Federal bench. 
   I would like to highlight some of Mr. Gould's personal history. He married his wife Suzanne more than 30 years ago, and they have two children. their 23-year-old son Daniel, who is also an Eagle Scout, is a jazz saxophone performer and technology student who recently graduated from Stanford University and founded his own Internet  startup business. Their 20-year-old daughter Rebecca is a sophomore at Hampshire College in Amherst, MA. Rebecca was selected for the Seattle ``High School Hall of Fame'' for her courage in conquering challenges following an auto accident in which she was seriously injured. 
   Mr. Gould also has been supported in this and all other endeavors of his life by his mother, Sylvia Gould. She is an active 81-year old walker and swimmer who justifiably takes some credit for her son's accomplishments since she encouraged him to do well in school and succeed as a Boy Scout. 
   Mr. Gould graduated the Wharton School of Business and Commerce at the University of Pennsylvania with a B.S. in economics. He received his J.D. degree in May 1973, graduating magna cum laude from the University of Michigan Law School where he won academic awards and served as editor-in-chief of the Michigan Law Review. During law school he received the Abram Sempliner Memorial Award for legal excellence, the Henry Bates Memorial Scholarship, and the Order of the Coif. 
   After law school, Mr. Gould served as a law clerk for Judge Wade McCree on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit. He next served as a law clerk for Justice Potter Stewart at the U.S. Supreme Court during the 1974 term. 
   Since December 1975, Mr. Gould has practiced law as an associate and then as a partner with Seattle's largest firm, Perkins Coie. He has had a varied civil litigation practice, including litigation in antitrust, banking, director and officer liability, and trade secrets. Mr. Gould is 
   highly respected in his field and has worked for many of our region's most influential companies and constituencies. 
   Mr. Gould's fellow lawyers in the King County Bar Association honored him with the 1987 Award for Distinguished Service to the Legal Profession and Public. He was elected to the Board of Governors of the Washington State Bar Association for 1988-91 and served as President of the Washington State Bar Association for its 1994-95 term. Also, as President-Elect and as President of the Washington State Bar Association, Ron co-founded with Washington State Attorney General Christine Gregoire a project to implement mediation in Washington State high schools to prevent youth violence. This program teaches young people how to avoid the kind of tragedies our nation has seen too much of in recent years. 
   Mr. Gould shares my commitment to public education. He has served Bellevue Community College as a trustee from 1993 to the present and was elected chair of the Board of Trustees in 1996. 
   In addition, Mr. Gould has served as a member of several legal delegations under the People to People Citizen Ambassador Program, founded by President Eisenhower and supported by Presidents since as a means of enhancing international personal diplomacy and goodwill. He has participated in legal delegations to eastern Asia, Tokyo, and Eastern Europe. 
   Mr. Gould's long and consistent leadership service to the Boy Scouts has been well-recognized. He became an Eagle Scout in 1962. He serves on the executive board of the Chief Seattle Council of Boy Scouts of America, which serves over 40,000 youth and participating adult leaders. Mr. Gould has served as vice president for Programs, vice president for Exploring, vice president for Special Events and chair of the Jamboree Committee. In 1995, he received the Silver Beaver Award for Chief Seattle Council, the highest award given to volunteer leaders. In 1998, he received from Boy Scouts of America the Distinguished Eagle Scout Award, reflecting decades of service to scouting and his profession. 
   Mr. President, I commend my colleagues for their decision to support Mr. Gould's confirmation unanimously. Again, I am proud of Ron and look forward to seeing him serve justice as a circuit court judge. I have no doubt he will carry his commitment to the profession and to the larger community to the federal bench and be one of our outstanding Ninth Circuit judges.

    Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, today I introduce a bill entitled the ``Quality and Accountability Are Best for Children Act.'' Every child in every classroom in America deserves to have a fully-qualified teacher; this legislation takes a comprehensive approach to helping communities make that a reality. The bill should be seen as complementary to the professional development sections of last year's Higher Education Act, and to the professional development sections of S. 7, the Public Schools Excellence Act. It should also be seen as part of a comprehensive strategy to forge a strong partnership on education between the Congress and the teachers, families, and students in communities across America which it serves. 
   While my efforts today are to address educator quality issues, I also recently introduced S. 1773, the Youth and Adult School Partnership Act of 1999, and S. 1772, the Family and School Partnership Act of 1999. In addition, I have been working for some time to pass S. 1304, the Time for Schools Act. All these efforts work in concert, to address the very real needs of our local schools when it comes to investing in the strategies that work, and in making it possible to involve all the necessary members of our local school communities in the decisions that affect them. 
   I have spoken before about what I have heard from the literally thousands of families and students and educators and community leaders I have met. I have spoken about how most Americans want an increased but appropriate federal role in education. They want decisions about how to help students achieve at higher levels to be made in the local school, but they also want increased federal funds--help where help is needed--to support their local efforts. Most people are shocked to learn that their federal government only devotes 1.6 percent of overall spending to education. 
   I have spoken before about how the federal class size reduction initiative has at its core a streamlined funding mechanism that targets funds to a goal and then holds the school accountable to the local community for making progress toward that goal. I have talked about how important I feel this funding mechanism can be as a way for us to look at other federal programs in education. I have spoken about the importance of keeping the federal role firmly in mind: to ensure opportunity on the one hand, and to fund shared national priorities on the other. In addition, we must ensure accountability for results at every step along the way. 
   We need to remember that what families and students and educators and community leaders have asked us for is targeted help and support, to fund such efforts as reducing class size, and providing for special education students, and after-school programs, and school modernization, and education technology, and 
   school safety and other efforts. Our responsibility is to give them the help they have sought, and no topic is more important to them than funding the necessary steps it will take to help local schools improve the quality of their corps of educators. We must rethink how educators are taught, and how we support their learning of the new skills it takes to teach students the basics and ``new basics'' that it will take for them to succeed in today's complex world. 
   In addition, we must fund local schools' efforts to recruit, retain and reward the world's finest corps of educators. And assure that their local communities can hold them accountable for doing so. 
   Today I introduce the Quality and Accountability are Best for Children Act, or Quality ABCs Act. This bill will help school districts improve the quality of their educator corps, and help  communities hold schools accountable for results. Since all communities are struggling to improve the quality of their teaching force, funds are provided at a level that allow all school districts to participate. It will authorize an additional formula grant, based on enrollment, in the amount of $2 billion per year for teacher quality improvement, plus $100 million per year for principal professional development. Funds will supplement current federal, state, and local professional development efforts, and school districts are encouraged to use existing law, waivers, of Ed Flex authority to coordinate activities at the local level. 
   With the goal of reducing paperwork and avoiding lengthy program descriptions, my legislation is based on the bipartisan mechanism agreed to under the fiscal year 1999 Appropriations Class Size Reduction Initiative. Applications are streamlined, school districts can use money flexibly at the local level, as long as they target funds to improving educator quality in at least one of three subject areas (recruitment, retention, and rewards) and school districts are accountable to the local community in the form of a report card describing district efforts to improve teacher quality. 
   School district are required to use funds to improve educator quality, but have a broad range of options to do so. 
   To recruit new teachers, school districts may use tools such as the following: 
   Establishing or expanding teacher academies, teachers-recruiting-future-teacher programs, and programs to encourage high school and middle school students to pursue a career in teaching; 
   Establishing or expanding para-professional training programs, paraeducator-to-teacher career ladders or other efforts to improve the training and supervision of para-educators; 
   Establishing or expanding programs for mid-career professionals to become certificated teachers; 
   Reaching out to communities of color or other special populations to make the teaching corps more reflective of current and future student demographics: 
   Placing advertisements, attending college job fairs, offering signing bonuses, and other recruitment efforts; 
   Embarking on and coordinating with other activities to help recruit the best quality teaching corps, such as: offering forgivable loans; assisting new hires to reach higher levels of state certification or to become national board certified teachers; recruiting new teachers in specific disciplines including math and science; 
   In addition, the Secretary of Education will be authorized directly, or by creating programs at the state or local level to: 
   Offer incentives for teachers to achieve national board certification; 
   Create forgivable loan programs under the current student aid programs; 
   Report on successful efforts and take part in dissemination activities; 
   Provide technical assistance to states and school districts to assist them to use technology in recruitment, processing, hiring, and placement of qualified teaching candidates. 
   To retain teachers, school districts may: 
   Use funds to offer or stipends or bonuses to educators to seek further subject matter endorsements, advanced levels of state certification or national board certification. These retention efforts can also fund other local initiatives specifically designed, such as mentor teacher programs, to retain teachers in the first 5 years of teaching; 
   Local education agencies can use funds, within district criteria for mentor or master teacher criteria, for a range of retention activities: mentor and/or master teacher job classification/career ladders; sabbatical/research activities such as the Fulbright program, or working in industry/non-profit world to improve teacher education; or other activities that keep teachers fresh while preserving their job slot/pay/benefits. These retention efforts can also fund other local initiatives specifically designed to retain experienced teachers, beyond the first five years of teaching; 
   To reward teachers: 
   School districts can reward elementary and secondary schools, based on improvement in the proportion of highly qualified teachers or other measures of teacher quality--improved recruiting, retention, improved ``in endorsement'' ratio, higher percentage of certificated staff, higher levels of certification, professional development curricular improvement; 
   School districts can provide teachers with a one-time bonus/reward of $5,000 for achieving national board certification; 
   Each state will receive $100,000 to support the McAuliffe 
   awards and National Teacher of the year awards to create additional forms of conferring respect and recognition upon distinguished educators. 
   The bill requires school district report cards to contain information about efforts they have undertaken to improve the recruiting, retention, rewarding, and accountability for teachers. Reports include which programs were offered locally, how much of the funding was spent on which efforts, and what results were achieved in terms of measurable improvements to teacher quality and student achievement. 
   Each report card shall include information about how parents and other community members can access processes under school district policies regarding teacher accountability. 
   The bill includes an effort to provide, on a statewide basis, professional development services for public elementary school and secondary school principals designed to enhance the principals' educational leadership skills. 
   The programs will provide principals with: 
   Knowledge of effective instructional leadership skills and practices; 
   Comprehensive whole-school approaches and programs that improve teaching and learning; 
   Improved understanding of the effective uses of educational technology, including best practices for incorporating technology into the instructional program and management of the school; 
   Increased knowledge of State content and performance standards, and appropriate related curriculum; 
   Assistance in the development of effective programs, and strategies for assessing the effectiveness of such programs; 
   Training in effective, fair evaluation and supervision of school staff, and training in improvement of instruction; 
   Assistance in the enhancement and development of the principals' overall school management and business skills; 
   Knowledge of school safety and discipline practices, school law, and school funding issues. 
   The bill also includes the K-12 school sections of my teacher Technology Training Act. Last year, I included in the Higher Education Act provisions to improve pre-service teacher training offered by universities, by including technology in teacher training. The Quality ABCs Act will take the relevant steps to integrate technology into the professional development offered by school districts. 
   This bill is only one step but it is a necessary one. We cannot succeed in improving student learning if we do not also invest in the quality of our educators. We must assure that schools can use all the tools at their disposal to do what's necessary, and the Quality ABCs Act funds the recruitment, retention, rewards and accountability measures essential to their success. 
   In all these pieces of legislation, whether I am a sponsor 
   or a cosponsor, my approach is to offer help where help is needed. Schools face increasing challenges and higher expectations from their communities and from all Americans. 
   Now is not the time for easy answers. Too many have suggested that it's all about paperwork or all about trust or all about bureaucracy. We must take steps to squeeze the most out of every dollar, and make things more efficient, but, as we've seen with the funding mechanism under the class size reduction initiative, local flexibility, targeted to a specific purpose, with local accountability built in, can work very well. 
   But even that approach is only a partial answer. Helping all our schools perform for all students now and into the next century is a monumental task. None of these challenges is easy. The kind of student success we are hoping for will not happen without an actual, working partnership among local  schools and school districts, state and regional education agencies, and the federal government. The success will not happen without a partnership between educators and families and young people and community leaders. 
   No person, school, or government entity has the resources, the research, the leadership, the experience, or the capability to go it alone. People cannot succeed in a global economy without an education that is world-class, relevant, and sufficiently funded. We all must work together as a nation if we want to succeed as a nation in a complex world. We owe this kind of perspective to our children and to our future. We must all strive to find the areas where we agree. Only a shared vision of the future of education will help us all to move toward our destination. Let us take that first step together. 
   Mr. President, the drafting of these bills would have been impossible without the efforts of two legislative fe3llows in my office, Ann Mary Ifekwunigwe and Peter Hatch. I thank them for their work.

   Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Kennedy amendment that we will be voting on shortly. It is important to note that 59 percent of the over 11 million workers who would receive a pay increase as a result of this minimum wage are women--women, by and large, with children; women who, because the minimum wage is so low today, are working two, three, four jobs. Those losing out in the country today because of the lack of a minimum wage increase are our children. They are being left home alone. They aren't getting the attention they deserve. They are not getting the support they deserve. A vote for the Kennedy amendment is a vote for our children. 
   While I have the floor, I understand the Senator from Pennsylvania came to the floor this morning to question the President's constitutional authority to insist on reducing class size. I remind our colleagues, reducing class size is something we as Democrats have fought for, stood behind, and we stand behind the President in the final budget negotiations. This is not about constitutional authority. It is about making sure young kids in first, second, and third grade get from a good teacher the attention they need in order to read and write and do arithmetic. That is a bipartisan agreement we all agreed upon a year ago, $1.2 billion to help our local schools reduce class size. 
   To renege on that commitment 1 year later and to have language which takes that money and gives it to whatever else school districts want to use it for sounds good except we lose out. A block grant will not guarantee that one child will learn to read. A block grant will not guarantee that a child who needs attention will have it on the day he or she needs it. A block grant will not assure that our children get the attention they deserve and learn the skills they need.

   Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, what we as Democrats are going to stand strong for is a commitment we made a year ago to assure that every child in first, second, and third grade gets the attention they deserve. If our Republican colleagues want to add additional money to the budget for block grants, for needs in our schools that we agree are important, we are more than happy to talk to them about it. But we believe the commitment we made a year ago is a promise that should be kept. 
   I thank the Chair and yield the floor.

   Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of the Kennedy amendment and as a cosponsor of the minimum wage increase.  
   In this debate, many people have the wrong idea about who this increase would affect. Many people think the typical wage earner is a young man or woman flipping burgers or working at a convenience store trying to make a few extra dollars to buy some CD's or to go to the movies. That image is inaccurate. And until we really understand who the people are who rely on the minimum wage, we won't approach this debate with the urgency it requires. 
   To clear up that misconception, let me set the record straight. In reality, 70 percent of the people earning a minimum wage are over the age of 20. That means that 11.4 million adults this year will have to try to live on a salary of $10,700. 
   Forty percent of these same adults are the sole source of income for their families. These are people who are working hard--just to get by and support their families. They deserve a fighting chance. 
   I am especially concerned that 59 percent of those struggling on the minimum wage are women. 6.8 million women--many of these single mothers--would benefit directly from this increase. 
   These single mothers are doing their best. They are trying to raise two kids--on average--on a below-poverty income. And how does this Congress support these struggling parents? By attacking programs like Medicaid, by cutting child care support, by taking away funding for nutrition programs, and by taking actions that hurt working families in need. 
   These are the same group of people that Congress says it wants to keep off of public support. 
   But how does this Congress support these struggling parents? By cutting vital programs and fighting efforts like this one--an effort that will help them work themselves above the poverty line. 
   This amendment does not eliminate jobs. It keeps people working--people who otherwise would be completely reliant on public support. Just a $1.00 raise would generate $2,000 in potential income for minimum wage workers. For an average family of four, that means 7 months of groceries, 5 months of rent, or 13 months of health care expenses. 
   I reached my decision to support this increase after very careful consideration. I have listened to the concerns of small business owners from across my state, who shared with me their thoughts about this increase. 
   I am happy to say that most of the businesses in Washington state are experiencing unprecedented growth. 
   In fact, since the federal minimum wage was last increased in 1996-97, employment in Washington has grown. Since September 1996, 231,900 new jobs have been created in Washington state--an increase of 9.5%. Washington's economy is strong, and our low-wage workers should share in that success. 
   Because my constituents understand the value of the minimum wage, they overwhelmingly passed their own minimum wage increase last year in Washington state. They raised the state minimum wage to $5.70 this year. In the year 2000, it will move to $6.50, and after that it will be indexed based on the Consumer Price Index. Mr. President, we should follow the example of my state and increase the minimum wage for all Americans. 
   The increase that we passed in the last Congress should be the first step--not the last--on our road to help these hard-working citizens. 
   It should be the first step because the economy and our world have changed--and we need to keep up with those changes. In 1979, a person could work 40 hours a week at minimum wage and stay out of poverty. Today, it takes 52 hours. To just reach the poverty line for a family of four, the minimum wage would have to be $7.89. That's why our last increase was a good start and why this proposed increase is the next vital step to helping these working families rise out of poverty. 
   Overall, a slight increase in the minimum wage provides those who work hard and play-by-the-rules an increased opportunity to succeed. If any of my colleagues oppose this minimum wage increase, I would ask them to consider trying to live on $10,700 this year--not just live on it--but try to raise a family on it. I think when you consider this debate in those terms, the right thing to do becomes clear. 
   It would be embarrassing if this Congress voted to raise its own salary but didn't vote to let hard-working American families work their way out of poverty. 
   I urge my colleagues to vote to increase the minimum wage. Let's show the American people that we have our priorities straight.

   Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, this is a difficult day for the people of my home State of Washington. I spent a lot of time last night talking with my neighbors, my family members, and local officials in Seattle. Like me, they are all trying to make sense out of something that makes no sense--yesterday's act of violence which killed two people, injured two more, and brought fear to my own neighborhood. 
   I wasn't sure if I should come to the floor today because I kept asking myself, What is there left to say? That once again, Americans are mourning after yet another deadly shooting? That once again, our families and our neighbors are gripped with fear because someone with a gun has decided to act violently? That once again, these outbreaks of violence aren't going away--they are just becoming too common? 
   I decided I should come to the floor to offer first my condolences to the families who have been involved and to talk to the people of my State and to thank the law enforcement officials who have responded and to talk to my colleagues about what we can do. My heart goes out to everyone who walks along the Burke-Gilman Trail, a trail I have walked on so many times. My heart goes out to every child who was held in school until they got home safely last night and into their parents' arms. My heart goes out to everyone who works and lives and knows this neighborhood. On Tuesday, it was safe. Today, it is gripped with fear. 
   Do we see what is happening? Or have these crazy acts become so common that we think we just cannot do anything about them? Can't we see it was someone else's neighborhood yesterday? It was my neighborhood today. Tomorrow it could be 
   your neighborhood. What can we do? Why haven't we done something already? Are we too gripped with partisanship? Are we too tied to special interests to act? Are we too afraid to change the status quo or to even question our own rhetoric? Are we asking the right questions? Are we really posing the right answers? 
   I know it is in our spirit as Americans to hope for the best and to believe things will get better. That is usually the way it is. But how many shootings will it take before we realize things aren't getting better on their own? They are getting worse, and it is up to us to take action. 
   It seems to me we, as a nation, have not dealt with the mentally ill. We don't want to pay for costly services. But don't we all end up paying later at a far higher cost? It seems to me, as a nation, we have not spoken out against violence in a strong and consistent manner. Can't we find a way to speak out without violating our freedom of speech? Can we have this conversation without falling into the traps of the far right and the far left? 
   Every time we turn on the news and we are gripped by fear, guns are involved. What tragedy will it take before we act? How many people have to die? How many shootings is it going to take? How close to home do they have to strike? 
   We had a shooting here in the Capitol, in the heart of democracy, and we still have not acted. Can't we make commonsense rules about keeping guns away from those who shouldn't have them? 
   I personally am tired of the old rhetoric. From the far left they say: Take all the guns away. From the far right they say: It is not the guns, it is lax law enforcement. 
   Give me a break. We are the greatest nation in this world; can't we come up with some commonsense ideas about how to protect our own people? I think we can. 
   This Congress has failed miserably. Here we are, in the same year as the Columbine tragedy, with no juvenile justice bill, no background checks for guns sold at gun shows, no resources for our communities to help those who are mentally ill, and no afterschool activities for our kids. That is shameful. 
   I hope my colleagues will stop and think for a minute and realize this is not happening to someone else. It is happening to all of us. It was Hawaii on Tuesday. It was Washington on Wednesday. It could be your State today. Those are just the mass shootings that get a lot of media attention. We should not forget, on the average, 12 children a day die from gunfire. 
   I say to my colleagues, I would love to work with anyone from either side of the aisle who wants to take the time to really talk about what our country is facing. There are many factors. People are overstressed; violence is pervasive; weapons are easy to get. It is a flammable combination that has exploded too often. 
   Our country is looking for leaders who will work together on this. 
   I say it is time to try. I invite anyone who wants to work with me to let me know.  I certainly am one mom who has had enough. 
   I yield the floor. 
   Several Senators addressed the Chair.

   Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I join my colleague on this side in urging a ``no'' vote on this bill, simply because, as Senator WELLSTONE just stated, of our compassion for the thousands of women who will not receive services--victims of domestic violence who won't have housing or counseling or health for their young children; the thousands of people who have diabetes or cancer who will not see the result of research done at NIH because of a 1-percent across-the-board cut; and, the thousands of women and children who depend on Head Start, who depend on our education programs, on the social services that are out there so that those young families can grow and be responsible and contribute back to our economy as strong families in the future. A 1-percent cut doesn't take into account the humanity behind the numbers in this bill. 
   Finally, on the topic of class size reduction, and why this side is so adamant about it, a block grant cannot guarantee that one child will get a better education. Because of the bipartisan work we did last year, today 1.7 million children are getting a better education in a smaller class size that guarantees they will have the ability to read, write, and perform the skills they need to do in order to compete in our complex world. If we continue this program, there will be millions more who are able to learn to read, write, and do better in school. 
   This is a partnership we have with our States and our local school districts. Our responsibility is to help them do what they need to do; to provide help where help is needed. There has been a call for reducing class size from across this country, because people know what works. The Congress should be a partner and continue our promise of a year ago in making sure that happens. 
   The bill will be vetoed; it will be an item of contention. The Democrats stand firm. We want to make sure those children get the best education possible. We are a partner in making that happen. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I thank the chairman of the Labor-HHS Subcommittee for his commitment to children and health. He stood with many of us many times. Unfortunately, the Labor bill that is now before us simply doesn't make the grade. I believe a number of our colleagues on this side of the aisle will be speaking against this and voting against this in the hopes that when the President vetoes it, the Senator from Pennsylvania, chairman of the committee, will work out some of the things about which we care deeply. 
   When you leave something for the last minute, you can't do it justice. This Congress has left our investment in educating our children, in protecting our American workforce, and in ensuring the health of the people of this country for the last minute, and the failures are pretty obvious. The Labor-HHS appropriations bill should have been the first bill we brought to the floor--not the last. 
   This Congress has tried every trick and every gimmick to play games with the budget. I am here to say we are nearing the end of this game; and for the American people who are watching this Congress, they must wonder how serious we are about addressing their concerns. If this flawed proposal passes, the American people will be the ones who lose out. 
   I am on the floor to say this combination D.C./Labor-HHS conference report--with its irresponsible across-the-board 
   cuts--fails to make the vital investments we need, the investments our constituents are asking for. 
   Mr. President, I will vote against this conference report, and I will tell you why. First, and most important, this bill will not guarantee that we reduce class size. 
   Now, last year, this Congress, the House and Senate, Democrats and Republicans, made a bipartisan commitment to help our districts hire and train new teachers. We did that because research shows students who learn in classes where there are fewer students in the early grades do better throughout their educational careers. They learn the basics--math, science, and English--and they have fewer discipline problems. We did that because it was a goal of all of us to make a concerted national effort to make sure that young children learned the basics, reduced the discipline problems, went on to college, and would be viable contributors to our economy when they graduated. 
   Last year, we made that bipartisan commitment and promised the parents of this country we would give their schools targeted money for smaller class sizes for the next 7 years. This bill walks away from that commitment. That is not acceptable. Not only does it walk away, but it broadens the use of the money so much that it could open the door to using vital, public education, class size dollars for private school vouchers. 
   Now, the President has said he will veto this bill if it does not keep our commitment to hire more teachers to reduce class size. I am proud that 37 Senators have joined with me to sign a letter saying they will back up that veto because we know that guaranteeing smaller classes for our children is worth fighting for. 
   The Labor-HHS bill's failure on class size is glaring. But to me it is just a start of many things that need to be fixed once this is vetoed and sent back to us in order for Democrats to be supportive. 
   It also fails to help families gain the literacy skills they need. When the Senate passed its version, we were able to provide an increase of $103 million, which would have taken thousands of people off of waiting lists for literacy services. But in this conference agreement, they cut the Senate number by $43 million. Those families were just about to get the skills they needed to rejoin our economy, and this agreement pushes them to back of the line. 
   This bill fails to make kids safer in our schools. In a year when the tragedy  at Columbine High School is still fresh in our minds, this bill cuts--cuts--$31 million from the Senate bill for the Safe and Drug-Free Schools Program. Local educators tell me we should double our funding in this area which is vital. Cutting it is just not acceptable. 
   This bill also fails the children who depend on the Head Start program. Head Start often makes the difference between success and failure in school for so many disadvantaged children. This bill does not do right by them. 
   This bill also cuts basic skills education for disadvantaged students. And it underfunds education technology programs at a time when we know all of our students need to get the skills in technology so that they can get the jobs that are open and waiting for them in so many communities across our country. It also cuts the vocational education program at a time when we know we need to make sure our kids graduate with skills to help them get jobs. 
   This bill does not do enough to support the Reading Excellence Act and bilingual education. This bill underfunds several important programs that build access and success for higher education students by not adequately funding Pell grants and vital programs like GEAR UP, LEAP, and TRIO. 
   I could go on. But it is clear that on education this bill is a missed opportunity. I am sure many people will try to claim that this agreement is ``a victory for education.'' But I can tell you as a former teacher and a former school board member that it is a hollow victory. 
   Mr. President, on labor issues, the Labor, HHS bill fails to adequately protect American workers and to promote universal employment. 
   This bill cuts funds for vital organizations, like the National Labor Relations Board--by 5 percent--and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration--by 6 percent--below the administration's request. I don't want to be any part of a bill that could harm our ability to enforce the labor and workplace laws that protect the health and safety of our country's workers. 
   This bill's irresponsible across-the-board spending cut would also hurt many vital job programs. For example, it would cut the Department of Labor's Youth Activities formula grants by $9.7 million, closing the door to almost 5,700 disadvantaged young people as they seek job training, summer employment, and educational opportunities. That is not acceptable to this Senator. 
   Mr. President, when it comes to protecting the health of our citizens, this bill is a mixed bag. While it does offer important support for the National Institutes of Health, for telemedicine for Children's Hospital in Seattle, poison control, and community and migrant health centers, the areas where it fails are so significant and so glaring that I cannot support the underlying bill. 
   This bill fails to address the human and social costs of AIDS and HIV. This bill's arbitrary and irresponsible across-the-board cut means that AIDS patients and their communities will suffer because it doesn't meet the growing need for services--services like drug assistance and pediatric AIDS care. 
   Similarly, the D.C. appropriations bill will hurt our ability to halt the spread of the disease because the bill continues to prohibit public funds from being used for clean needle exchange. 
   This bill also reduces our commitment to reproductive health care and family planning. I find it painfully ironic that last week, 48 Senators went on record against the principles of Roe v. Wade, claiming that abortion should not be a choice for women. Yet when it comes to reducing unintentional pregnancies or providing health care services for pregnant women, those same Senators are simply not there. This bill means that 40,000 women will be denied access to basic reproductive health care. It will reduce women's access to critical pre-natal care. 
   This bill's irresponsible across-the-board cut will also weaken our ability to respond to domestic violence. This bill would spend less money than we are spending this year on programs under the Violence Against Women Act. That means less money for rape prevention and for battered women's shelters. 
   Many communities in my State are struggling--struggling--to help women and children affected by rape and abuse. Reducing the Federal commitment in this area is simply unacceptable. 
   Some people will say this bill's across-the-board cut won't hurt anyone. They are wrong because denying emergency shelter to a battered woman and her children is painful. Denying access to reproductive health care services to 40,000 women is painful, and denying access to life-saving drug therapies for AIDS patients is worse than painful, it is deadly. 
   Mr. President, we still have an opportunity to do the right thing for our children, our families and our communities. I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this bill so the President can veto it and we can fix it--by undoing its damaging across-the-board cut and keeping our commitment to reduce class size. Let's show the American people that even though this Congress has failed--throughout the session--to do its work in a timely, responsible way, we still have the wisdom to get things right at the end.

   Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I want to join with my colleagues in paying tribute to Senator John Chafee. With his passing this week, the Senate lost a wise and courageous voice. Anyone who spent any time in the Senate could see that Senator Chafee's reputation for honesty and individual conviction were well-deserved. 
   I want to offer his family my deepest sympathy and my deepest appreciation for sharing him with us for so long. He served as a role model of what a Senator should be. 
   The more I think about Senator Chafee--the more I realize the qualities that are rare today, were common in the gentleman from Rhode Island. Rare qualities like courage, independence, and a desire to always do what is right. 
   He often fought alone for what he believed was right. He worked for legislative compromise, but never compromised his own principles. 
   I was proud to join with him on many important initiatives, and his mark can be found on many of the landmark environmental protection laws enacted in the last twenty years. He was a thoughtful environmentalist--protecting the health and welfare of people, wildlife, and the environment as a whole, while at the same time balancing the needs of the economy. He recognized the fact that the West had a different relationship with its natural resources than the East. His work on clean air, clean water, oil pollution, and endangered species has benefited the entire nation. The people and the environment in my state, 3,000 miles away from Rhode Island, are far better off today, because a man named John Chafee served 23 years in this body. 
   Senator Chafee was also a consistent and articulate supporter of trade. And on issues like China MFN, he and I worked for the same goals. 
   Senator Chafee was a champion of women's health care long before it was politically correct. Long before anyone had ever heard of ``soccer moms,'' he stood alone many times to fight for women's health, and he never backed down. 
   Senator Chafee was also a strong advocate of a woman's right to choose. He was a voice of reason in an increasingly emotional debate. He protected a woman's right to determine her own fate and to make her own health care decisions. He worked to improve access to reproductive health care services and to improve security at women's health clinics. I always took a great deal of comfort knowing he was at the table fighting for women. 
   Perhaps his greatest commitment was to children, all children. He worked to expand Medicaid to provide health care for milllions of low income children. He fought to protect Medicaid. I know there are milllions of children who are now healthy adults because of the work of Senator Chafee. One of my most vivid memories of Senator Chafee was fighting on the floor in June 1997 to expand health care security for the 10 million uninsured children. He refused to give up his goal, and he refused to pass an empty promise. His work created the successful, bipartisan Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) which ultimately will provide health security for five million children. Think of the kind of impact he will have on the quality of life for these five milllion children. 
   Mr. President, I believe one of my roles in the Senate is to speak for those that have no voice--children, working families, the environment, battered women, and the elderly. Those are the same causes John Chafee served and served so selflessly. I only hope I can measure up to the standard he set. 
   When someone like John Chafee--someone with rare personal qualities and a legacy found in the millions of people his policies helped--when someone like that leaves this world, it makes the rest of us reflect on his contribution. Mr. President, this Senate is the poorer for his passing.

   Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, we are nearing the end of the budget process, and there were inferences made on the floor yesterday that the class size initiative should not be part of the final budget agreement because--it has been claimed--the President doesn't have the authority to insist that we hire more teachers to reduce class size. 
   Mr. President, I have come to the floor today to clarify the President's important--and authorized role--in fighting for smaller classes. I have also come to the floor to remind my colleagues that this year we have smaller class sizes--where discipline has been restored and kids can learn the basics--because last year Congress made a bipartisan agreement--and a bipartisan commitment--to hire 100,000 new teachers in order to reduce size in first, second, and third grades. 
   Today, as the budget process winds down, I want to make sure that our agreement is not pushed aside. 
   Let me remind my colleagues that the President does have the authority in the Constitution to register his opinion on whether or not the budget is acceptable. In fact, the President doesn't just have the authority, but he has the responsibility under Article I, Section 7 to return bills with his objections that he does not approve of. And I'm glad the President has that authority and that he will use it if this Congress doesn't guarantee class size reductions. And 38 Senators signed a letter saying we would stand behind his threatened veto because we agree class size reduction is critical. 
   Mr. President, in trying to reduce the number of students in each classroom, I have followed the process. In March, I was told it wasn't the right time. In the subcommittee, I was told we weren't allowed to offer amendments. In full committee, I was told it was too controversial. Then, when I got the floor, I was told I'd have to wait until the Elementary and Secondary Education Act was written. If we have to wait until then, we won't be able to tell kids they will have small classes next year, and we can't tell teachers they will have their jobs next year. 
   Mr. President, I have followed the process, and I have waited. But I am tired of waiting as I sense that this Congress is trying to undo our bipartisan commitment. What am I supposed to tell students, ``Congress has to write the ESEA and until then, you have to learn your ABCs in a class with 35 students.'' To me, that is not acceptable. I'm not going to tell them that. If this Congress feels so strong that guaranteeing smaller classes is not important, you can give them your excuses. 
   This is about money in the budget that Congress approved last year, and it is about us keeping our commitment to improving education by reducing class size. 
   The class size reduction effort has been a success in its first year. Today, we have kids learning in classrooms  that are less crowded--learning to read, learning to write, and learning the basics with fewer discipline problems. They are working with a trained professional. Research shows they are going to have higher graduation rates, higher grade point averages and a higher likelihood of pursuing higher education. 
   They are going to be successful because of the work this Congress did one year ago. And the President has a right to insist on it. We as Democrats have a right to insist on it, and--as a Senator in this body--I am here to insist on it. 
   Now is the time to keep our commitment. Now is when the decisions are being made. Now is when we have to stand up for smaller classes. If we have to wait until after all budget deals have been cut, until after all the money has been spent, we will have failed those teachers, we will have failed those parents, but most importantly, we will have failed those children. 
   Mr. President, it is a national priority to reduce class size so kids can learn the basics and so discipline can be restored in the classroom. It is a promise we made last year and we need to put the money behind it, wherever it is appropriate. 
   A few weeks ago, I met with a teacher in Tacoma, WA, named Kris Paynter. Last year, there were 30 kids in her first grade class. This year there are 13 because of this program. That makes a huge difference for those kids. I saw a disciplined classroom where kids could learn the basics. Next year, we don't know how many kids will be in Ms. Paynter's class. And we can't even guarantee those 29,000 teachers hired last year will keep their jobs. 
   Mr. President, putting all of these process questions aside, what really matters at the end of the day is that kids have smaller classes. The teachers and parents in this country care that we do it. Period. 
   The millions of children who are now in smaller classes aren't wondering ``has this been authorized?'' or ``is this in the budget?'' or ``does the President have the constitutional authority to reduce class sizes?'' What really matters is that we fulfill our promise to parents, teachers, and students that we made last year in a bipartisan process. 
   Mr. President, I hate to say it, but at every turn, this Congress has put special interests ahead of the interests of real families. This is the last opportunity we will have to do something significant for kids. We didn't address the loopholes that still allow kids and criminals to get their hands on guns. We didn't make schools safer after the Columbine tragedy. We didn't provide health insurance to more kids. This is the last chance we have in this Congress to do something for out kids, fix a problem we know exists. And I am here to say that we cannot let this chance pass. 
   We need to keep our commitment to reducing class size. We need to be able to tell those teachers they will have jobs next year, and we need to be able to tell those kids they will have small classes next year. Let's stand behind our commitment.

   Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, today I join with Senators DEWINE, DODD, and ABRAHAM to introduce a bill to reauthorize the Safe and Drug-Free Schools and Communities Act. This bill sends a strong signal to American schools and communities about the importance of creating a safe learning environment in the wake of recent tragedies in Littleton, Colorado; Springfield, Oregon; Paducah, Kentucky; and Moses Lake, Washington. It serves as a reminder that we haven't forgotten these and many other tragedies, and that the Senate recognizes all communities need funding and tools to effectively reduce violence and drug use. 
   The hallmark of the bill is a new emphasis on accountability for results in creating safer schools and using research-proven prevention strategies. The bill reauthorizes the Safe and Drug-Free Schools and Communities Act, and authorizes funding of $875 million to local school districts that they can use flexibly to address local needs for the prevention of violence and drug use. 
   In exchange, schools must invest in strategies that are shown to be effective in reducing drug use, discipline problems, and school violence. 
   What we've learned from recent school tragedies is that this can happen anywhere in America. No school is immune from problems, so every school community must take steps to prevent them. 
   We know that local educators know best how to prevent these problems, whether through offering after-school programs, or working with parent groups and law enforcement to reduce gang activity, or getting young people  more involved in their community activities. This bill gives communities the tools to make a measurable difference--and recognizes that we won't prevent violence unless we all work together in partnership. 
   Our legislation is based on more than a year of conversations with local educators in Washington state and around the country. I have worked closely with Senators DODD, DEWINE, ABRAHAM and other Senators from both sides of the aisle to assure that we find areas of agreement early, so that we can make real progress in our discussions as we move forward. The bill emphasizes results and accountability, but gives communities flexibility to get there. Recognizing that no efforts can succeed to make young people safe and drug free--inside or outside of the classroom--without all elements of the community working together. The bill assumes collaboration and communication at all levels and across all barriers. 
   There are several areas where this bill does not yet reflect a full vision of how we can help schools and communities prevent violence and drug use. We need to continue working on national activities, on school safety planning, on coordination, and on other areas. We need to address the concerns of other Members who have not yet participated in the debate. However, this bill is a good, bipartisan start to the discussion, and represents Senators looking for common goals--something that needs to be brought back into the larger debate on education and our public schools. 
   I want to thank Senators DODD, DEWINE, and ABRAHAM and Suzanne Day from Senator DODD's office and Paul Palagyi from Senator DEWINE's office for their great work on this so far. I look forward to making continued progress in this discussion.

    Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I am introducing a bill today to make sure we treat America's veterans with the compassion they deserve. They have sacrificed so much of their personal lives for our country. And with this bill, I want to show them we appreciate their service, and we will be there when they need help. 
   When veterans need medical care, they file a claim for benefits with the Veterans Administration. It requires researching information over many years and from many different government organizations. 
   Traditionally, the Veterans Administration has helped veterans research and file their claims. That's the way it should be. 
   But a series of recent court decisions have changed that--and made it harder for veterans to file their claims. I want to set the record straight. The VA has a duty to assist veterans in filing their claims. 
   So today, I am introducing legislation to amend Title 38 of the United States Code to clarify and improve veterans claims and procedures. 
   My legislation clarifies that the Department of Veterans Affairs has a duty to assist veterans in preparing all of the facts pertinent to a claim for benefits. The VA has historically aided veterans in gathering information from the federal bureaucracy so they can file a claim. 
   Let's not forget--the claims process was set up to aid our veterans. It's important to all veterans, especially those with severe mental and physical disabilities. 
   Homeless veterans need help. Elderly veterans need help. And family members--who sacrifice to care for veterans--need help from the federal government. 
   Anyone who has ever dealt with a veterans claim for benefits knows this is a very difficult process. It can be frustrating for veterans who--even in the best of circumstances--may be forced to wait several years for a claim to be approved and granted. Veterans already pay a heavy cost for delayed benefits. They often face financial, family, and health problems, as they try to resolve their claims. 
   Yet, as we speak, the claims process at the VA is becoming even more difficult for America's veterans and their families. 
   Through a series of court decisions, the VA's historic duty to assist veterans has been set aside. The courts responsible for veterans claims have determined that it is now the individual veteran's responsibility to file a well-rounded claim before they can get assistance from the VA. The effect has been to place the burden on the individual veteran to gather information--service records, medical records, and other documentation--from the federal government in order to file a claim. 
   Mr. President, the courts have decided our veterans in need of assistance must go it alone. Homeless veterans suffering from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder must now prepare their claims without assistance from the government they sacrificed for. Veterans who are sick, mentally or physically disabled, indigent, or poorly educated now face new barriers to assistance they may be legally entitled to receive. Veterans without the financial resources, time or familiarity with the claims process system must navigate through the bureaucracy without federal assistance. That's not the way we should treat America's veterans.  
   Clearly, the courts have misinterpreted Congressional intent. The Veterans Judicial Review Act was signed into law during the 100th Congress with the following language,  
   It is the obligation of the Veterans Administration to assist a claimant in developing facts pertinent to his claim and to render a decision which grants him every benefit that can be supported in law while protecting the interests of the Government.  
   Somehow the courts interpreted that language differently. My objective in introducing legislation today is not to quarrel with the courts. I simply want to reassert congressional intent and re-establish the VA's duty to assist veterans. My legislation simply confirms the Congress believes it is important and appropriate for the federal government to assist veterans in preparing claims for benefits. 
   Mr. President, this legislation is widely supported among those who work on veterans benefits claims every day. Numerous veterans advocacy groups, including the Disabled American Veterans, strongly support my legislation. This bill has original cosponsors from both sides of the aisle. It is a bipartisan response to a real problem confronting America's veterans. 
   Let's do the right thing for America's veterans and particularly for those veterans who need the government's assistance the most. 
   I urge prompt Senate consideration and passage of this legislation.

   Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, we are rapidly coming to the end of the session. This Congress has a lot of unfinished business left in far too many areas: Patients' Bill of Rights, prescription drug, guns, juvenile justice, and education. Today I want to take a few minutes to talk about one of America's top priorities, education. Today I am going to be introducing, a little bit later, and describing several bills that will improve education in America. We are about to start our biggest debate on education in 5 years as we begin the work on the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. 
   If the past few weeks are any indication, I am very concerned that in this critical education debate our children are going to be the losers, and that would really be a shame. Education has long been a bipartisan issue, but somehow in this Congress partisanship has too often pushed progress aside. 
   Two weeks ago, I tried to help our schools continue a very successful initiative to hire more teachers so there would be fewer kids in each of our classrooms. Just 1 year ago, this initiative was announced as a bipartisan issue and leaders on both sides of the aisle claimed credit for this national effort to reduce class sizes in grades 1 through 3. But now, a year later, this amendment has been defeated on a party line vote. 
   Parents and teachers want real solutions. They want real investments. They want a real commitment to our schools. I believe we can do what is right for education in this Congress. When we listen to parents and educators and students, a vision for improving our schools based on their real needs is clear. I believe we must first establish the following principles: We need to ensure that all children have an equal opportunity to learn. We need to elevate the teaching profession through better pay and greater respect. We need to hold educators accountable for students' progress. And we need to invest more money in public education. 
   This plan is built on a partnership among Federal, State and local officials, working together to help all our students. It starts with making the school work for our students. That means making sure the school buildings are safe and secure and modern. That is why I am an original cosponsor of the School Modernization Act, so kids do not have to learn in crumbling schools or overcrowded classrooms. 
   It means making sure the teachers have the training and professional development they need to give our kids the best. That is why I am an original cosponsor of the Public Schools Education Excellence Act. A section of that act that I wrote called Teacher Technology Training will make sure all educators know the best ways to use technology to teach our children. 
   It means making sure education does not stop when the school bell rings. We need to give our kids safe and educational things to do when the schoolday is over and parents are still at work. And it means making sure there are, at most, 18 students in each classroom instead of 30. We know in smaller classes kids get the time and attention they need. That is why I wrote and I am going to continue to fight for the Class Size Reduction and Teacher Quality Act, to give schools the money they need to reduce our class sizes, particularly in the younger grades. 
   Everyone wants smaller classes. When you ask experts in education, they tell you that, based on their research, smaller classes make a big difference. When you ask teachers what makes the biggest difference, the answer is smaller classes. And when you ask parents, Do you want your child in a class of 30 or 18? the answer is clear; they want smaller classes. Smaller classes help kids learn the basics and improve classroom discipline. Parents, teachers, and experts all want smaller classes. 
   Last year, this Congress promised schools we would fund smaller class sizes for 7 years. This year, schools across the country are taking advantage of that program. But here we are, just 1 year later, and that commitment is fading. Last week, I released a letter signed by 38 Senators, Senators who are going to stand up for class size reduction. The President said if this Congress does not fund class size reduction, he will veto the bill. Last week, 38 Senators said they would stand with him and back up that veto. 
   Let me say to my colleagues, if you shortchange class size, the President will veto your bill. If you try to override that veto, we will stand together to make sure our kids get the smaller classes they deserve, the ones we promised them 1 year ago, a promise made by both parties to all of our kids. 
   I have other ideas on how we can help our students. As we begin discussing our Nation's Federal education law, I will introduce legislation to assure that all segments of our school community--teachers, students, and families--play their role in improving education. 
   To help teachers, my legislation will give us the tools to recruit the world's finest educators; to retain educators by improving professional development and creating career ladders so that our best teachers will not leave the classroom but will have the opportunity to continue to grow professionally; to make sure all teachers can use the tools of technology to boost student achievement. 
   It will reward and recognize great educators. It will offer a meaningful financial bonus for States to improve teacher pay. And it will require educators to meet the same high standards we expect of our students. 
   Today, I am introducing legislation to help students by creating more meaningful roles for students in their schools and communities, finding the best examples of students and adults working together and rewarding those efforts and sharing those ideas with all schools, and showing the link between student involvement and student achievement. 
   Because we know parents and families are a child's first and best teachers, I am also introducing legislation that will invite families into our schools, train teachers, and administrators in the best ways to involve parents, and invest in family involvement at newer and higher levels. 
   It will use technology to make it easier for parents to stay informed and involved in their child's education. Borrowing from an example in my home State of Washington, it will build on the success of parent cooperative preschools which use local community colleges as a vehicle to improve parent involvement and school readiness for young kids. 
   I have talked with parents in my State, and it has become clear they want to be involved in their child's education. Too often, though, their jobs prevent them from being involved. That is why I introduced my Time for Schools Act. Which lets parents take up to 24 hours of unpaid leave off work each year to attend academic events at school and be involved in their child's education. That is the type of real-  world solution that will help our parents. 
   Those are all parts of the comprehensive vision for improving education. I believe this plan will help prepare America for the next century. It is based on what we know works and has real money to back it up. 
   All too often, the debates on education begin with talk about how bad our public schools are. Everyone will hear that our schools are in shambles. I believe our schools are not failing, but if we let this Congress cut education funding, we will be failing our public schools. 
   Most of our public schools are doing a good job. Some are not, but they are all facing more and more challenges with fewer resources than ever before. We have to recognize those challenges and prepare our schools and our children for the future. 
   Today, I hear a lot of talk about bureaucracy. I hear our schools are trapped by red tape. I was a school board member, and I know what it is like to fill out forms and, yes, we should reduce paperwork. That is why the class size reduction application is only one page, is available online, and takes just a few minutes to fill out. Less paperwork is good. But somehow some people have convinced themselves that if there are fewer forms, our kids will magically get the resources they need. Fewer forms will not buy a textbook or build a classroom. 
   It takes resources and support, and it takes real dollars. Reducing bureaucracy sounds good, but it means nothing if it is only as good as the paper on which it is written. 
   I hear a lot of talk about flexibility. That sounds great. I support flexibility because I know that principals and local school boards understand their own needs best. But we cannot forget right now that the Federal Government sets money aside for specific programs, like for homeless children or gifted children, money to help our schools become safe and drug free. That money is targeted for special needs which we as a country believe are important, and those Federal funds do a lot of good because they are seven times more targeted than other education funds. That money ensures that every American child gets a good education. 
   But the plans I hear about tell schools, ``Do whatever you want with the money.'' At the same time, those plans start cutting the amount of money available to schools, and then our kids are the losers. When that dollar is no longer attached to a specific need, like making our schools safe after Columbine, or meeting the needs of a child who is behind or a child who is gifted, it is a lot easier to cut that money. 
   Now schools think they have a choice, but they really have fewer options because there is less money available than there was the day before. When schools have choice with less money, national priorities and protections lose out. 
   Suddenly that choice does not sound so good. Suddenly that choice is not liberating; it is limiting, and that is wrong because some of our kids are going to be left behind when a bill promising some version of flexibility makes schools choose between children. Let's not forget that we have already passed a better version of school flexibility called Ed-Flex earlier this year. Let's see how that serves our children before we try more risky approaches. 
   We cannot forget why the Federal Government got involved in education. Thirty years ago, when education was left to States and localities alone, some kids got left behind. So the Federal Government set a basic safety net for all children. These are the targeted funds that some plans would put into a block grant and then cut. 
   The Federal Government does two other vital things: It helps us meet national priorities, such as teaching technology or reducing class size, and it also helps students meet their potential and achieve at their highest levels. When this Congress ignores the reasons why we have a Federal partner in education, we are left with false choices that fail our children. 
   Our country deserves a real choice. We must offer real plans, real money to improve our schools, not false choices and not funding cuts. I urge my colleagues to listen to the American people. We should treat education like a priority and do right by all of our children.

   Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, first, I thank my colleague from California for her tremendous amount of work on the floor on a very emotional and difficult issue to show all of us what is really behind the bill that is before the Senate and to stand up for women across this country to make their own health care decisions, along with their family and their own faith, without the interference of those of us on this floor who are not medical doctors and who are not members of that family. 
   I thank the Senator from Iowa, Mr. HARKIN, for offering the amendment we are now debating because his amendment--and I want my colleagues to look at it very carefully--is really what this debate is about, and I think everyone here knows it. 
   The question is, Do we really stand for and behind Roe v. Wade? Do we really support a woman's right of choice? Are we going to allow women to make this incredibly important decision in consultation with their physician and their family and their faith or are we going to stand on the floor of the Senate and make that decision for her? 
   I have often heard many of my colleagues talk about being pro-choice simply because they do not support overturning Roe v. Wade. But over and over, when it comes time to provide access or services or to allow Federal employees access to these services, these same pro-choice Members vote to restrict a woman's right to choose. 
   I know the difference, as do the voters in my home State of Washington. In 1992, my State voted overwhelmingly in support of a woman's right of choice. The voters in Washington State recognized the importance of the landmark Supreme Court decision giving a woman the right to determine her own fate and make her own personal health and reproductive decisions. 
   Washington State voters have also spoken out on this particular effort--the underlying bill--which attempts to undermine Roe v. Wade by outlawing one abortion procedure after another. 
   In 1998, a year ago, the voters of my State overwhelmingly defeated a ballot initiative to ban the so-called partial-birth abortions. That initiative was almost identical to S. 1692. 
   I am really proud of Washington State voters who stood up to defend a woman's right to her own reproductive health and choice decisions. That initiative which was on our ballot a year ago was defeated because there was no exception, no consideration for the health of the woman. Her life and her health were made not just secondary concerns but of no concern at all. In my State, voters understood why this kind of ban was a threat to all women. 
   The Harkin amendment we are now debating gives us the opportunity to talk about the role of the woman in this decision. It will allow Members to stand up and say the Roe decision was an important one, one we stand behind. The Harkin amendment will send a message to women that we recognize the turning point in equality that followed the 1973 landmark ruling. 
   As the Senator from Iowa pointed out, there was a time in our country's history when a woman could not own property, could not vote, or could not have access to safe family planning services. There was a time when women were not allowed access to equal education. There was a time in our history when having a child meant being forced out of the workplace. 
   Those times 
   have passed. Women made gains as those offensive policies were changed, banned, and overturned, and I will do everything I can to make sure votes such as the one we are talking about do not take us back to the dark days because the women of America are not going back. 
   The proponents of S. 1692 say their intent is to end late-term abortions. We are not going to be fooled. We know this is just another attempt to chip away at Roe v. Wade. This is just another attempt to undermine that decision and deny access to safe and legal abortion services. This is just another attempt to harass providers and generate hateful rhetoric. This is just another attempt to limit access. 
   The proponents are trying to achieve through public relations what they cannot do in the courts or in the legislatures. Their ultimate goal is to make the rights and health protections guaranteed in Roe worth nothing more than the paper on which it was written. The Harkin amendment calls them on this bluff and demands accountability.

   Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, since 1995, we have had more than 110 anti-choice votes in Congress. More than 110 times, we have voted to restrict or deny access to safe and legal reproductive health care. More than 110 times we have voted to undermine and limit the constitutional guarantees that were provided in the Roe v. Wade decision. 
   The goal is clear: Little by little, the proponents of the underlying bill want to place so many barriers and obstacles in front of women and their physicians that abortions will only be available to a few wealthy women, just as it was before the Roe v. Wade decision. A woman who is a victim of rape or incest, a woman whose life is at stake, will not even be able to find a provider. In fact, I want my colleagues to know we are already seeing this. In some States, there are no doctors now who are willing to provide a legal health care procedure. We are going back to the dark days when women's health was at risk because of the laws of this land. 
   Let there be no confusion; the proponents of this bill want to outlaw abortions step by step since they know a majority of Americans will not give up their rights to make this decision on their own with their own family and their own faith. 
   If you support the Roe v. Wade decision, you have to support the Harkin amendment. If you support a woman's right to choose, you have to support the Harkin amendment. And a ``no'' vote will send a message that the Senate does not support Roe or recognize the importance that a woman has to make this decision on her own. 
   I urge my colleagues to vote for the Harkin amendment and put us on record where we ought to be: To allow women to have safe, legal reproductive choices that allow them to make this decision with their family and their faith. That is where this decision rests, not on the floor of the Senate. 
   I thank my colleague from California.

   Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I commend the Democratic leader, Senator DASCHLE, for bringing to the attention of the Senate this extremely important day, October 21. It is the Day of National Concern about Young People and Gun Violence. This is a day that all Members in the Senate have recognized as a day we want young people everywhere to take a pledge to not bring a gun to school and to resolve their conflicts without using a gun. It is a very important message. 
   This is a bipartisan message. Senator Kempthorne and I began this effort 4 years ago. This year, Senator JOHN WARNER and I put this resolution forward in a bipartisan way. It was supported by all Members of the Senate. It is a simple message to young children. Millions of them today took the pledge and joined with others in their community to take the power of reducing violence into their own hands. 
   As leaders of the United States, we have a responsibility to do all we can to reduce youth violence in this country. We need to stand behind these young kids who are taking violence and the issue of violence in their own hands and say we, as the leaders of this country, stand with you. 
   I commend Senator DASCHLE for his statement, for bringing to the attention of the Senate our responsibility as adults to reduce the number of guns to which our young kids have access, and urge our colleagues to move forward on these critical issues that have been left behind in this session of Congress. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I feel compelled to express my concerns with the Commerce, Justice, State, and the judiciary appropriations bill for fiscal year 2000. I am disappointed by the inadequate funding for coastal salmon recovery and the Pacific Salmon Treaty. While I cannot complain about the funding for Washington State in relation to Alaska, California, and Oregon, I do believe the overall funding is woefully inadequate to address the tremendous crisis facing threatened and endangered salmon runs. Each state and their counties and cities are prepared to face the challenge of salmon recovery, but they must be given the tools to do so. The funds for Pacific coastal salmon recovery should be at the President's request level of $100 million. 
   In relation to the Pacific Salmon Treaty, I must again bemoan the lack of adequate funding. The treaty agreement was signed late in the appropriation process and thus it is understandable that large scale funding would be difficult. However, the funding provided under this conference report does not approach our obligations under the treaty. We need to be signaling the intention of the U.S. to meet its treaty obligations and this bill does not do this. I believe the funding for the Northern and Southern Funds called for under the treaty should be more than the $10 million provided. Furthermore, the elimination of the buy-back money for fishers is not only cruel to the families affected by the fishing reductions, but again does not send the right message to Canada. 
   In a related matter, the conference report contains legislative language that exempts Alaska from the provisions and requirements of the Endangered Species Act in relation to salmon. While I appreciate the State of Alaska's desire to have the Pacific Salmon Treaty protect its salmon fishery from any jeopardy findings, the provision is not in the spirit of the treaty. The states of Oregon and Washington, as well as the Pacific Northwest tribes, negotiated in good-faith to conclude the treaty. I must support Governor Kitzhaber and Governor Locke and the tribes in their opposition to this provision. This legislative provision is in effect an addendum to the treaty that the treaty negotiators did not agree to. It should be removed. 
   I am very disappointed the conference did not adopt the language of the Hate Crimes Prevention Act. Hate crime is real. Despite great gains in equality and civil rights over the latter part of the century, hate crimes are still being committed and offenders must be punished. Including this provision would have given us more tools to fight hate. The proposal would have expanded the definition of a hate crime and improved prosecution of those who act our their hate with violence. If someone harms another because of race, gender, color, religion, disability or sexual orientation, they would be punished. 
   I am very disappointed that the conference failed to include the Senate language of the Hate Crime Prevention Act. Along with many of my colleagues, I will continue to push this legislation. It is about basic human rights for those who all too often persecuted while the majority looks the other way. 
   I am also unhappy the Community Oriented Policing Services Program (COPS) was so underfunded. The Subcommittee mark in the Senate included no funding for COPS. Some of us on the full Appropriations Committee restored a modest amount of money to the program. The President requested $1.2 billion, but the conference funded COPS at only $325 million. That is wrong. 
   COPS is one of the most successful programs of this decade. The initiative to get an additional 100,000 new police officers on the streets was widely criticized by many from the other side of the aisle. They said that the federal government could never successfully assist local law enforcement. They were wrong. The program is now praised by former opponents, the states are happy with it, and it has proven to be very effective. 
   Another problem is that once again behind closed doors, we continue to assault reproductive health care for women. Section 625 of this conference report includes a major authorizing change that was not part of the House or Senate passed bills. We did not debate or discuss this major expansion of the conscience clause included in Public Law 106-58, FY00 Treasury Postal Appropriations. 
   For those members who were not in this closed door meeting, let me explain. Section 625 would allow a pharmacist to object to providing a woman with a prescribed contraceptive if he or she felt the use of this contraceptive was contrary to their own individual religious beliefs or moral convictions. Pharmacists can make a moral judgment and deny women access to emergency contraceptives or any form of contraceptive. 
   We already allow plans participating in the FEHBP to object on religious grounds to providing reproductive health services; we now will allow pharmacists to deny women access. A small town pharmacist could simply object to filling a prescription because she morally objects to the use of contraceptives. A woman is now subjected to the moral judgment of her pharmacists. Is she free to simply go to another pharmacy? In many rural communities there really aren't nearby other options. In addition, many plans require use of a preferred provider for pharmacy benefits. What happens if your preferred provider is morally opposed to providing contraceptives?  
   I do not oppose conscience clauses, but I do oppose denying women access to legally prescribed contraceptives simply based on moral objections. This is simply outrageous and once again the threat to women's health is ignored. 
   Let me end on a positive note. I am appreciative of the subcommittee's work to provide $5 million in State Department monies for costs related to the World Trade Organization Ministerial meeting which will be held in Seattle, WA. The President requested $2 million and I am pleased Senator GREGG and Senator HOLLINGS agreed to my request for a significant increase for WTO expenses. I had hoped for some additional language to ensure that the State Department reimbursed localities in Washington State for legitimate WTO police and fire expenses. The WTO Ministerial will be the largest trade meeting ever held in the United States, both the Federal Government and Washington State are bearing significant costs to host the world's trade negotiators. I expect and I will push the State Department to be responsive to the needs of local governments in Washington State in the expenditure of these additional monies.

   Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I rise today in support of meaningful campaign finance reform. It is high time that this Congress act to improve our political process and to restore faith in our democracy. In fact, it is past time. 
   When I was elected by the people of my State in 1992, one of the key things they asked me to do was to help fix our campaign finance system. I have been part of the reform effort since I walked through these doors. 
   Well, here it is, 7 years later. And it's the same old story. Campaigns still cost too much money. And too often, the power of ideas is pushed aside by the power of money. That is not the way our system should work. We need to do all we can to show the American people that their voices count--and to provide that their voices will be heard over the roar of special interest money. 
   Overall, I do think we have made some positive changes in the way the Capitol operates since my election. I do think we have addressed some of the issues families care about. But our campaign finance system still undermines our best efforts--draining public interest in our political process and sapping the energy from American voters in ways that will affect our democracy for years to come. 
   The opponents say the public doesn't care about campaign finance reform. But, in fact, the role of money in our elections and the rise of special interest influence have a profound--and very negative--effect on public perception of politics. Many people believe that Members of Congress are controlled by special interests and wealthy donors--and are no longer listening to their concerns. It keeps them from voting and from participating in the decisions that affect their lives. 
   We are here to represent the people of our States. As a representative of working Americans, I have felt from the beginning that it is my duty to ensure their voices and concerns are heard loudly and clearly in the political process. If my constituents believe they aren't being heard and that is partially due to the influence of special interests, then I must do something about it. This legislation is an opportunity to act. 
   I think this legislation could go further, for example, in the way it treats types of advocacy. Express advocacy is designed to get the public to vote for or against a specific candidate. For that reason, express advocacy is regulated. There is another type of advocacy that is not regulated. It's called ``issue advocacy.'' Issue advocacy campaigns were intended to allow groups and individuals to communicate their support or opposition to particular policy issues. Unfortunately, these activities have become organized campaigns run by partisan groups to influence the election or defeat of a particular candidate. At a minimum, the public has a right to know who is funding these so-called ``independent expenditures'' by requiring the producers of these campaigns to disclose their contributors. A earlier version of this bill would have made issue advocacy subject to similar restrictions as express advocacy. That is one of the improvements I would like to see as we go through the amendment process. 
   But there are other amendments that would weaken the bill's provisions and could kill this legislation. One is the so-called Paycheck Protection Act. It is a poison pill to kill true campaign finance reform. This provision would defund unions by setting up barriers to their obtaining union dues to spend on political activities. However, the Republican Paycheck Protection Act misses the target. Despite the rhetoric, no worker is ever forced to join a union or pay for political and legislative activities with which he or she does not agree. Never. But the vast majority of unions--and their supporters--believe their voices are critical to a strong healthy economy and to strong, healthy families. And I agree with them. 
   I am not optimistic about this process. We have some very determined foes who oppose any attempt at reform. While we have 100 percent of the Democratic caucus and a handful of brave Republicans, it appears we do not have 60 votes to stop a filibuster against reform. This makes me unhappy, but not willing to give up. 
   I will continue to participate in the coalition of those Senators pushing for reform. I will keep my commitment to bring public faith back into our political system and to return political power to our citizens. And I will anxiously await the day when 60 of my Senate colleagues agree with the American people that now is the time for campaign finance reform.

   Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise today to express my deep frustration with the fiscal year 2000 Agriculture Appropriations conference report before us today. 
   Two weeks ago, the Republican leadership pulled the plug on conference negotiations--and killed our prospect for comprehensive sanctions reform and additional assistance for agricultural communities hit by economic and natural disasters. When we look back at this first session of the 106th Congress, I believe we will see that decision as an enormous missed opportunity. 
   Mr. President, Washington State is the most trade-dependent State in the nation. And agriculture is one of its top exports. The growers in my State need open markets. Many times, market access is closed or limited because of the actions of foreign countries. We can and must fight to break down barriers erected by other nations. 
   We must also fight to break down the barriers to foreign markets created by our own government. Sanctions that include food and medicine do not serve the interest of the United States, and they certainly do not serve the interests of American producers. Oftentimes with the best of intentions, we have cut off all trade with states that sponsor terrorism, fail to live up to critical agreements, or refuse to share our principles of democracy. 
   Mr. President, we cannot and must not tolerate reprehensible actions by rogue states. But it is clear to me, and to 69 other Senators who voted for sanctions reform, that we do not act in the best interests of American foreign policy or American agricultural producers when we impose unilateral food and medicine sanctions. The people in the world we hurt most with unilateral sanctions are American growers. 
   The Senate sanctions reform package was a huge step in the right direction. It deserves to become law. Wheat growers in my State deserve access to Iran,  which was once our largest export market for soft white wheat. And pea and lentil growers deserve access to Cuba, a market valued at more than $17 million. In both of these cases, our foreign competitors have stepped into the market vacuum created by U.S. sanctions policy. 
   The Administration started sanctions reform earlier this year. I applaud those efforts--belated as they were. I also applaud those in the Senate who worked so hard for passage of the Ashcroft-Dodd amendment. But now the Republican leadership has sent the message to our foreign competitors that they can continue to conduct business as usual--that U.S. growers will not soon be players in markets like Iran and Cuba. 
   After hearing for years from some Republicans that the Administration lacked the will to reform our nation's outdated and ineffective sanctions policies, the Republican leadership proved it could not lead American agriculture into the 21st century. Too many of our producers already have empty wallets and empty bank accounts, and--in response--Congress delivered empty rhetoric on sanctions reform. 
   In September, I met with representatives of the Washington Association of Wheat Growers, the Washington State Farm Bureau, and the Washington Growers Clearing House. I expressed my strong support for the sanctions reform package and my hope that some agreement could be reached between the Senate and House. I did not count on the procedural maneuvering that doomed the sanctions package. Our growers deserved a better process and a better outcome. 
   Mr. President, in a perfect world this bill would include sanctions reform. Its emergency provisions would include more money for specialty crops, additional funding for the Market Access Program, and increased Section 32 money for USDA purchases of fruits and vegetables. It would include more resources for farm worker housing and Natural Resource Conservation Service conservation operations. 
   On the subject of minor crops, I would like to discuss the plight of apple growers in my state. The apple industry in particular is in the throes of the economic conditions as bad as anyone can remember. Poor weather has played a role, but more important are the economic factors. 
   Apple juice dumping by China has removed the floor price for apples. Chinese apple juice concentrate imports increased by more than 1,200 percent between 1995 and 1998. I was pleased to sponsor a letter with Senator GORTON, signed by a total of 21 Senators, to Commerce Secretary Daley urging the administration to find that Chinese dumping is destroying our growers and to impose stiff retroactive duties. Weak Asian markets and high levels of world production have contributed greatly to the terrible economic situation in central Washington State. 
   As a result, many small family farms that grow some of the best fruit produced in the world are going out of business. Many of these are not marginal producers. They are efficient growers whose families have been growing high quality apples and pears and other commodities for generations. 
   As in other parts of rural America, the communities that rely on tree fruit production for their economic base are reeling. It is hard to diversify when your economic foundation is crumbling. It is estimated approximately 20 percent of Washington apple growers will lose their farms in the next three years. And that is a conservative estimate. Over the August recess, I met with community leaders in north central Washington State. Okanogan County alone has experienced $70 million in losses in the tree fruit industry leading the county to declare an economic disaster. 
   Language in the conference report directs the Farm Service Agency to review all programs that assist apple producers, and review the limits set on operating loan programs used by apple growers to determine whether the current limits are insufficient to cover operating expenses. I urge FSA to complete this review as soon as possible so that those of us who represent apple producing states can improve the Federal Government's assistance to our growers. 
   The conference bill before us provides $1.2 billion in disaster assistance. The report language for that section of the bill mentions the plight of apple growers and urges the USDA to address the problem. However, let's be clear that it will be very difficult for my state's apple producers to get meaningful assistance through this bill. Simply put, this bill is not a victory for apple growers or their communities. 
   In the future, some of my colleagues may criticize the Secretary of Agriculture for not recognizing the critical need in apple country and failing to deliver assistance. Earlier this year, August Schumacher, Under Secretary for Farm and Foreign Agricultural Services, came to Washington State to hear from apple growers. I know the administration understands the needs of growers in my State. But the administration can't realistically address the needs of growers all over the country with only $1.2 billion. Nevertheless, I look forward to working with my colleagues to direct aid to apple growers in Washington State. 
   I believe this Congress needs to accept responsibility for the shortcomings in the bill. The Republican leadership certainly bears complete responsibility for the unacceptable manner in which this bill was taken out of the hands of congressional appropriators in the middle of conference negotiations. 
   Mr. President, while this bill is flawed, it is still a step in the right direction. I intend to vote for the conference report. Although we didn't do it two weeks ago, we must send the message this week that Congress will try to reestablish opportunity in rural America. 
   I will vote for this bill because it provides emergency assistance to many of our farmers and ranchers. It funds research, including new positions for potato and temperate fruit fly research that are critical to minor crop producers in my state. It delivers a nearly $52 million increase for programs in President Clinton's Food Safety Initiative, including $600,000 for research into listeriosis, sheep scrapie, and ovine progressive pneumonia virus (OPPV) at ARS facilities in Pullman, Washington and in DuBois, ID. It provides critical funding for WIC and other feeding programs, and for P.L. 480. 
   Mr. President, I was tempted to vote ``no'' on this conference report. But just as I believe the Republican leadership should have embraced responsibility on sanctions reform, I believe voting to pass this conference report is the most responsible approach. It is my sincere hope the Senate will pass sanctions reform and other legislation to provide greater economic security to communities that rely on agriculture before the end of this session.

   Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise to join my colleagues in voicing my strong support for Senate ratification of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. 
   I joined many of my colleagues in calling for Senate consideration of the CTBT. But I must say, I am very disappointed in the process put into place for the consideration of this hugely important issue. 
   This Senate is failing our great tradition of considering treaties without partisan political influences. So many giants in American history have argued for and against treaties right here on the Senate floor. 
   Senator Henry ``Scoop'' Jackson from my own State of Washington was one of these giants. Following his death in 1983, Charles Krauthammer wrote the following in Time magazine:  
   The death of Senator Henry Jackson has left an empty stillness at the center of American politics. Jackson was the symbol, and the last great leader, of a political tradition that began with Woodrow Wilson and reached its apogee with John Kennedy, Lyndon Johnson, and Hubert Humphrey. That tradition--liberal internationalism--held that if democratic capitalism was to have a human face, it had to have a big heart and strong hand.  
   Scoop believed in that strong hand. Senator Jackson was one of the Senate's workhorses on defense issues. Few had the intimate knowledge of defense and foreign policy matters that Scoop did. And this expertise extended to arms control issues as well. Jackson was famous for taking apart arms control agreements and forcing the Executive Branch and his congressional colleagues to understand fully the matter at hand. And, Jackson was a leader at perfecting arms control agreements that fully protected U.S. interests. 
   Senator Jackson was a defense giant throughout the cold war. He championed his country's defense from the days of FDR to Ronald Reagan's first term as President. Yet, he managed to vote for every single arms control treaty that came before the Senate. He tackled the issues and he protected U.S. interests and national security with absolute devotion to country free from partisan politics. Jackson epitomized the Senate at its best; senators working together without time constraints; senators holding the Administration accountable; senators engaged to strengthen U.S. foreign and defense policy. 
   Sadly, this Senate has taken a different course. Few can argue with any sincerity that the Senate has given the CTBT a thorough consideration. The treaty's certain defeat was dictated by partisanship before a single hearing was held on the issue. Advise and consent, the Senate's historical and constitutional duty has been laid aside by a majority party currying favor with extremist political forces. 
   In spite of the pre-determined fate of the CTBT, I want to take a few minutes to briefly explain my strong support for the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. 
   The arguments used to end nuclear testing in 1992 are just as valid today. 
   My service in the Senate has largely mirrored the U.S. moratorium on nuclear weapons tests. President Bush wisely halted U.S. nuclear weapons testing after a thorough review of our nuclear weapons arsenal and particularly the safety, reliability and survivability of our stockpile. 
   The directors of our nuclear weapons laboratories, numerous prestigious weapons scientists, prominent military leaders and many others remain convinced that the United States can safely maintain its nuclear weapons stockpile without nuclear testing. 
   The CTBT freezes in place U.S. supremacy in nuclear weaponry. 
   The United States maintains a 6,000 warhead nuclear arsenal. This arsenal is the result of more than 1,000 nuclear weapons tests. Our nuclear weapons program is without equal in the world. 
   Dr. Hans Bethe, Nobel Prize winning physicist and former Director of Theoretical Division at the Los Alamos Laboratory wrote the President on this very point in early October. Dr. Bethe's letter states:  
   Every thinking person should realize that this treaty is uniquely in favor of the United States. We have a substantial lead in atomic weapons technology over all other countries.  We have tested weapons of all sizes and shapes suitable for military purposes. We have no interest in and no need for further development through testing. Other existing nuclear powers would need tests to make up this technological gap. And even more importantly, a test ban would make it essentially impossible for new nuclear power to engage.  
   Here's a leading nuclear scientist, a Nobel Prize winning physicist, and he says the CTBT is ``uniquely in favor of the United States.'' To me, this is an immensely powerful argument in favor of CTBT. 
   Failure to ratify the test ban treaty will send a disastrous message to the international community. 
   Already our closest allies are calling upon the United States to ratify the CTBT. Many countries urging the U.S. to ratify the treaty are the same countries covered by the U.S. nuclear umbrella including our closest NATO allies. 
   Given our unmatched nuclear superiority, is the United States' national interest advanced by working with the global community to combat potential nuclear threats? The answer to me is a resounding yes. 
   The United States is safer if the world is working together to combat any proliferation threats. Without the CTBT, the global effort to combat proliferation will be seriously undermined and U.S. credibility and sincerity will be jeopardized. 
   Our efforts to contain and control a nuclear arms race in South Asia will be undermined. The global resolve to contain proliferation in the Middle East in countries like Iran and Iraq will diminish. Rogue states like North Korea will not face the same international resolve on weapons experimentation and development. It will be easier for nations like China to modernize its nuclear weapons program if the CTBT does not enter into force. Our already difficult efforts to work with a fraying nuclear establishment in Russia will also be setback by the U.S. failure to lead the effort to end nuclear weapons testing once and for all. 
   The CTBT is largely a creation of the United States. For more than 40 years, Republican and Democratic Administrations have pushed the world to end nuclear weapons testing. President Clinton signed the CTBT upon its successful negotiation in 1996. More than 140 countries have signed the treaty. Some 40 countries have ratified the treaty. U.S. ratification of the CTBT is one of the last remaining hurdles to the treaty entering in force. 
   Mr. President, I will cast my vote with absolute confidence for ratification of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty.

   Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I strongly oppose this amendment. It is our responsibility as the Nation's leader to reduce the hazards that America's workers face--not putting roadblocks in the way of increased workers safety. Ergonomic injuries are the single largest occupational health crisis faced by men and women in our workforce today. We should let the OSHA issue an ergonomics standard. 
   Ergonomic injuries hurt America's workers. Each year, more than 600,000 private sector workers in America are forced to miss time from work because of musculoskeletal disorders, MSDs. These injuries hurt our America's companies because these disorders can cause workers to miss three full weeks of work or more. Employers pay over $20 billion annually in worker's compensation benefits due to MSDs and up to $60 billion in lost productivity, disability benefits, and other associated costs. 
   The impact of MSDs on women workers is especially serious. While women make up 46 percent of the total workforce and only make up 33 percent of total injured workers, they receive 63 percent of all lost work time ergonomic injuries and 69 percent of lost work time carpal tunnel syndrome. 
   In addition, women in the health care, retail and textile industries are particularly hard hit by MSDs and carpal tunnel syndrome. In fact women suffer over 90 percent of the MSDs among nurses, nurse aides, health care aides, and sewing machine operators. Women also account for 91 percent of the carpal tunnel cases that occur among cashiers. 
   Despite all the overwhelming financial and physical impacts of MSDs and the disproportionate impact they have on our Nation's women, there have been several efforts over the years to prevent the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, OSHA from issuing an ergonomics standard. 
   Let's be clear, this amendment is intended to delay OSHA's ergonomic standard until yet another scientific study is performed on ergonomic injuries. We have examined the merits of this rule over and over again. Contrary to what those on the other side of this issue say, the science supports an ergonomics standard. We also had a bipartisan agreement that the current National Academy of Sciences, NAS, study would--in no way--impede implementation by OSHA. 
   NAS has already studied this issue. The new study would address the exact same issues that were dealt with in the previous study. They are also using the same science. No new science. It is mind boggling. 
   The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, NIOSH, studied ergonomics and conclude that there is ``clear and compelling evidence''  that MSDs are caused by work and can be reduced and prevented through workplace interventions. The American College of Occupational and Environmental Medicine, the world's largest occupational medical society, agreed with NIOSH and saw no reason to delay implementation. The studies and science are conclusive in the Senator's mind. 
   Further--and possibly most persuasive--last year, the administration and leaders in Congress on this side of the aisle only agreed to a new study because those on the other side said that this new study would not delay the issuance by OSHA of a rule on ergonomics. Now they are not standing by their word. 
   We cannot afford to delay an important standard which will greatly improve workplace safety. 
   I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment. We should allow OSHA to issue an ergonomics standard. It will be an important first step in protecting our Nation's workers from crippling injuries.

   Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, included in the Manager's amendment is an important provision relating to women's health and access to reproductive health care services. I am pleased to have worked with the managers of this bill to send a strong message on the importance of direct access for women to their OB/GYN. 
   I was disappointed that we were unable to address the rule XVI concerns with the amendment I had originally filed. My original amendment would simply allow women and their OB/GYNs to make important health care decisions without barriers or obstacles erected by insurance company policies. My amendment would have required that health plans give women direct access to their OB/GYN for all gynecological and obstetrical care and would have prohibited insurance companies from standing between a woman and her OB/GYN. 
   However, it has been determined that my amendment would violate rule XVI. As a result of the announcement by the chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee that he will make a point of order against all amendments that may violate rule XVI, I have modified my amendment. The modification still allows Members of the Senate to be on record in support of women's health or in opposition to removing barriers that hinder access for women to critical reproductive health care services. 
   I am offering a sense-of-the-Senate that puts this question to each Member. I realize that this amendment is not binding, but due to opposition to my original amendment, I have been forced to offer this sense-of-the-Senate. 
   I am disappointed that we could not act to provide this important protection to women, but I do believe this amendment will send an important message that the U.S. Senate does support greater access for women to quality health care benefits. 
   I have offered this amendment due to my frustration and disappointment with managed care reform. I have become frustrated by stalling tactics and empty promises. The managed care reform bill that passed the Senate has  been referred to as an empty promise for women. I can assure my colleagues that women are much smarter than they may expect and will not be fooled by empty promises or arguments of procedural discipline. When a woman is denied direct access to the care provided by her OB/GYN, she will not be interested in a discussion on ERISA or rule XVI. She wants direct access to her OB/GYN. She needs direct access, and she should have direct access. 
   My amendment also reiterates the importance of ensuring that the OB/GYN remains the coordinating physician. Any test or additional referral would be treated as if made by the primary care physician. This amendment does not call for the designation of an OB/GYN as a primary care physician, it simply says that if the OB/GYN decides additional care is necessary, the patient is not forced to seek approval from a primary care physician, who may not be familiar with her overall health care status. 
   Why is this amendment important? The number one reason most women enter the health care system is to seek gynecological or obstetric care. This is the primary point of entry for women into the health care system. For most women, including myself, we consider our OB/GYN our primary care physician--maybe not as an insurance company defines it--but, in practice, that's the reality. 
   Does a woman go to her OB/GYN for an ear infection? No. But, does a pregnant woman consult with her OB/GYN prior to taking any antibiotic for the treatment of an ear infection? Yes, most women do. 
   I know the policy endorsed in this amendment has in the past enjoyed bipartisan support. The requirements are similiar to S. 836, legislation introduced by Senator SPECTER and cosponsored by several Senators both Republican and Democrat. This amendment is similar to language that was adopted during committee consideration in the House of the fiscal year 1999 Labor, HHS appropriations bill. A similar directive is contained in the bipartisan House Patients' Bill of Rights legislation. It has the strong support of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and I know I have heard from several OB/GYNs in my own state testifying to the importance of direct access to the full range of care provided, not just routine care. 
   I would also like to point out to my colleagues, that 39 states have similar requirements and that as participants in the Federal Employees Health Benefit Plan, all of us--as Senators--have this same guarantee as well as our family members. If we can guarantee this protection for ourselves and our families, we should do the same for women participating in a manager care plan. 
   I realize that this appropriations bill may not be the best vehicle for offering this amendment. However, I have waited for final action on a Patients' Bill of Rights for too long. I have watched as patient protection bills have been stalled or delayed. Last year we were told that we would finish action on a good Patients' Bill of Rights package prior to adjournment. 
   Well, here we sit--almost 12 months later--with little hope of finishing a good, comprehensive managed care reform bill prior to our scheduled adjournment this year. 
   I also want to remind my colleagues that we have in the past used appropriations bills to address deficiencies in current law or to address an urgent need for action. I believe that addressing an urgent need in women's health care qualifies as a priority that we must address. I realize that the authorizing committee has objected to the original amendment I filed. As a member of the authorizing committee as well, I can understand this objection. But, again I have little choice but to proceed on this appropriations bill. 
   We all know that it was only recently on the fiscal year 1999 supplemental appropriations bill that we authorized a significant change in Medicaid recoupment provisions despite strong objections from the Finance Committee. 
   In last year's omnibus appropriations bill, we authorized a requirement that insurance companies must cover breast reconstruction surgery following a mastectomy. I can assure my colleagues that this provision never went through the authorizing committee. I would also point out that there are several antichoice riders contained in this appropriations bill that represent a major authorization. 
   As these examples show, when we have to address these types issues through appropriations bills--we can do it. We have done it in the past, and we should do it today to meet this need. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. We all talk about the need to ensure access for women to health care. I applaud Chairman SPECTER's efforts in this appropriations bill regarding women's health care. Adopting this amendment gives us the opportunity to do something that does ensure greater access for women. This is what women want. This is the chance for Senators to show their commitment to this critical benefit. 
   I would like to quote a statement made by our subcommittee chairman that I believe more eloquently explains why I am urging this amendment. ``I believe it is clear that access to women's health care cuts across the intricacies of the complicated and often divisive managed care debate.'' I could not agree more. 
   We know from the current state requirement and the Federal Employee Health Benefit Program requirement, this provision does not have a significant impact on costs of health care. We also know from experience that it has a positive impact on health care benefits. Since 60 percent of office visits to OB/GYNs are for preventive care, we could make the argument that adoption of this policy would reduce the overall costs of health care. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this amendment and ask that we do more than simply make empty promises to women. We need an honest and fair debate on this policy. 
   I would ask my colleagues to seek further education or advice from women as to the importance of direct access and ask their female constituents about the relationship they have with their own OB/GYN. Let women speak for themselves. If you listen, you will hear why this policy is so important and why women trust their OB/GYN far more than their insurance company or their Member of Congress.

   Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, this evening we will vote on what is arguably the most important of our 13 appropriations bills, the Labor, Health and Human Services and Education Appropriations Act. When it comes to funding for education, the Congress has fundamentally ignored the messages of the American people. In this bill, education spending remains in the neighborhood of 1.6 percent of overall federal spending, a very poor neighborhood indeed. The American people cannot understand why, if education is their first priority, it is the last bill passed and the lowest funding priority of their Congress. They cannot fathom why, in a year when school districts across the country are hiring highly-qualified teachers to reduce class size, the Congress is walking away from its commitment. 
   The House, regrettably, has done far worse by education than any of us could have imagined. The drastic cuts to education that would take effect under the House bill would send America back into the 19th century, not forward into the 21st. The House bill would cause 142,000 fewer children to be served in Head Start, would keep 50,000 students out of after-school programs, and would deprive 2.1 million children in high-poverty communities of extra help in mastering the basics of reading and math. 
   The Senate has done better by our schools, but only through smoke-and-mirrors budgeteering that should give our school communities no long-term confidence. Advance funding is not without effect on the local school budget, which demands consistency and predictability. 
   The numbers in the Senate bill are a better level from which to negotiate in the conference committee, but even these funding levels ignore the grim reality that our schools face a fundamentally tougher job than they did even five years ago, with skyrocketing enrollment, of students who are more expensive to educate, and who have less support at home and in the community. 
   Despite all this, at least the Senate provides current funding for most educational services, makes some effort toward meeting the higher needs in others, and does a good job of providing new investments in a few areas. Funding for the Individuals with Disabilities in Education Act is increased by more than $900 million, a good start toward meeting our national commitment to fund forty percent of a local school district's costs of educating a disabled child. 
   The $200 per student increase for Pell grants is a good investment, but only about half of what is needed this year. I'm particularly proud that we were able to increase funding for adult and family literacy, by increasing the adult basic education program by more than $100 million. This means that thousands more adults and their families will be able to take the first steps toward increased viability in our changing economy. 
   The failures in this bill are many, however. As an example, let's look at funding for vocational and technical education. Current funding or freezes in funding are not sufficient in a world where the economy changes as rapidly as ours is changing. Young people need the skills not only to survive but to thrive. All young people need access to applied skills as well as theoretical ones, in order for them to succeed in the workplace, the classroom, and in life. And yet, we do not make the significant investments needed. 
   The largest failure of all, of course, is the backward step the majority is taking on class size reduction. Reducing class size by helping school districts hire 100,000 high-quality teachers nationwide is an investment in our schools that is paying dividends right now. The first 30,000 teachers are in the classroom, and what a classroom it is. To walk from a class with 25 or 28 first graders into one of the smaller classes I've been visiting this fall is a stark contrast. Improved achievement, increased time on task, more individual attention, and a lack of discipline problems are obvious in the smaller class. The teacher in the larger class looks as if he is running to catch up, and the student must keep her hand in the air for too long a time. This is a very real, tangible investment we have made in our schools. The Senate and the House, on a completely partisan basis, are reneging on the most common-sense investment in school improvement made in recent history. The reason that the Republicans are so afraid of these 30,000 teachers is that this program is actually working. 
   Pili Wolfe, Principal at Lyon Elementary School in Tacoma, Washington, where federal class size funds are being used to dramatically reduce class size in first grade, and to provide high-quality professional development for teachers through a program called Great Start, says: ``Children in our first-grade Great Start classrooms have shown more growth within the first month of school than any previous first-grade class.'' 
   Andrea Holzapfel, a first-grade teacher at Lyon, says: ``Smaller numbers allow me to spend significantly more time in individual and small-group instruction. Having fewer children allows more participation by the kids in discussion and classroom activities.'' 
   The program works. The one-page, on-line application form means no paperwork, no bureaucracy. Two-hundred and sixty-one of Washington state's two-hundred and ninety-six school districts have already put class size reduction and teacher professional development into effect in their schools. The accountability is to the local community, through a school report card describing how many teachers were hired and in which grades. Improved student achievement will be the ultimate measure of the success of this year's investment. 
   But the investment cannot stop here. 
   The President has said that this bill is headed for a veto, because of the  lack of continued investment in class size reduction, and other key education efforts. 
   One such effort is GEAR UP, which enables low-income schools and their neighboring colleges to form partnerships to get mentors to help students study hard, stay in school, and go on to college. Funding for this program is only $180 million, not the $240 necessary to get this important investment to the communities where it is needed most. 
   Increased funding for after-school programs was given short shrift, despite what the research shows about the link between young people having no positive pursuits in the afternoon and evening, and the related increase in crime. 
   Education technology has been cut by the House, and the Senate numbers are not sufficient to meet the growing need in an area where the federal government is the primary funding source in most schools and communities, far beyond the investments made by states and localities. 
   When it comes to education, this Congress has not stepped up to the very challenge we are asking the educators, students, families and communities across America to meet. When the expectations on Congress increased, the level of commitment and vision decreased. 
   I am voting for this bill to move the process along. If class size funding and other key investments are not restored, the conference report will be vetoed. If it is vetoed, I and many of my colleagues will vote to sustain that veto. This bill in its current form is only a vehicle through which we may negotiate higher numbers in conference. 
   The American people have a stake in this battle. We need to hear their 
   voices now. 
   This has been a difficult vote for me. While the bill does provide a significant investment in public health and safety, it does so on the backs of our children and retreating from our commitment to improve class size. This bill cannot survive in its current form. 
   I do want to point out what I believe are positive aspects of this bill. I applaud the efforts of Chairman SPECTER and Senator HARKIN in preparing an appropriations bill that meets important public health priorities. I know how difficult this appropriations process has been and know their job was not easy. As a member of the Labor, Health & Human Services & Education Subcommittee, I am pleased that our product does maintain our commitment and investment in public health. 
   The additional $2 billion investment for NIH alone will bring us that much closer to finding a cure for diseases like cancer, Parkinson's, cardiovascular, Alzheimer's, MS and AIDS. Every dollar invested in NIH reaps greater savings in health care dollars as well as greater savings in human lives. This additional investment will ensure that we remain on a course to double NIH funding. I know how important this funding is and am proud to represent outstanding research institutions like the University of Washington and the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center who receive significant research funding from NIH. 
   I am also pleased that we have provided funding for trauma care planning and development for the states. This is an essential program that assists the states in efforts to effectively develop trauma care strategies. We have neglected trauma care and we have lost ground in life saving delivery of critical care. I was pleased that the Subcommittee recognized the importance of trauma care planning. 
   As many of my colleagues know, I have been pushing for federal funding to establish a national poison control plan. My allegiance to ``Mr. Yuk'' is well known within this chamber, as well as within the HELP Committee. It was only two years ago that I offered an amendment during FDA reform to protect voluntary poison control labeling like Mr. Yuk from possible elimination. I have used my position on the Appropriations Committee to push for funding for poison control centers and for a national 1-800 hotline. I am pleased that this legislation includes $3 million for poison control efforts. This line-item within HRSA is a major victory for children and their parents. We have taken a huge step forward in developing a national poison control plan that builds on successful efforts in all of the states, like those made in Washington state. 
   As one of the most vocal women's health care advocates in the Senate, I am pleased that the Committee report to accompany this Appropriations bill addresses several women's health issues and enhances programs to eliminate gender bias or discrimination. I want to thank the Chairman for his support of funding for the CDC Breast and Cervical Cancer Screening Program for low income women. This continued commitment will save lives and improve survival rates for women who often have little or no access to cancer screening. We know that early dedication offers the greatest hope of survival. 
   I am pleased that we have been able to provide additional funding to expand the WISE WOMEN program to screen for cardiovascular disease as well as breast and cervical cancer. Cardiovascular disease is the number one killer of American women. Twice as many women die from cardiovascular disease than breast and cervical cancers combined. I was disappointed that we could not find additional monies to expand this program in all 50 states, and will continue to work to secure additional funding for FY2000. 
   There are many reasons why I consider the Labor, HHS Appropriations bill one of the most important appropriations bills and the one piece of legislation that truly effects all Americans and offers hope to the most vulnerable. But, perhaps one of the most critical programs funded in this appropriations bill is funding for battered women's shelters. This funding does save lives. This funding is the life line for battered and abused women and children. I am proud to have worked with the Chairman of the Subcommittee to increase our investment in battered women's shelters. I am working for the day when we need no more battered women's shelters. Unfortunately, we have a long way to go. But, by increasing the funds available by $13.5 million for FY2000, we have offered communities more resources to assist victims of domestic violence find a vital, life-saving safe shelter. 
   I am hopeful that these important public health investments will survive what will likely be a difficult conference with the House.

   Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, as a member of the Foreign Operations Appropriations Subcommittee, I have always supported the subcommittee's bill here on the Senate floor. We always have difficult and controversial choices before our subcommittee. Under the leadership of Senators MCCONNELL and LEAHY, we have been able to do a reasonable job crafting a bill with bipartisan support. 
   Unfortunately, that is not the case this year. I will be voting against the foreign operations appropriations measure. I take this action for a number of reasons. 
   Most importantly, this bill is woefully underfunded. The bill is $2 billion less than President Clinton's request and some $800 million below last year's congressionally approved funding level. This account has already been cut significantly in recent years. The most recent cuts, in my estimation, will cripple our already meager foreign aid efforts. We spend a great deal of time here in the Congress talking about the U.S. role as the world's lone superpower. The foreign operations bill is a test of our sincerity in providing global leadership beyond the realm of U.S. military might. 
   This bill does so many things that project an America to the world that we can and should all be proud of. We educate young girls, we provide microcredit loans to small family enterprises, we export democracy throughout the world, we cooperate with human rights activists and monitors, and we create opportunities for American citizens and business interests abroad. Unfortunately, the bill on the floor today cripples our efforts to work internationally, vital work that is in the national interest of the United States. 
   The foreign operations bill fails to provide any funding to the important Middle East peace process. The President had requested $500 million in assistance to aid the implementation of the Wye River Accords. This small investment in peace and security is even more important given the recent agreement between Israel's new government and the Palestinian Authority. Now is the time to reassert U.S. support for the peace process that, at this moment, shows so much hope and promise. 
   I also am disappointed that this bill underfunds our export promotion programs. For example, the Export-Import Bank, which protects and creates American jobs, is funded below the 1999 level and far below the Administration's 2000 request. U.S. workers compete in the global economy. That's a fact. It is equally true that other governments in Asia and Europe do far more to help their exporters succeed. Our ability to compete and win abroad for American workers is impacted by the foreign operations bill. And this bill could do far more for American workers. 
   Finally, I continue to have reservations regarding the funding levels and the restrictive language placed on our international family planning assistance programs. The restrictive language is particularly harmful as it cripples the provision of valuable family planning programs which aid population control, economic development, environmental protection and some many other areas. Our false family planning debates driven by domestic politics here in the United States only harm thousands of women and families in the developing world. 
   Mr. President, this bill will not become law. President Clinton has promised a veto for numerous, very legitimate reasons. I encourage the President to follow through with a veto if this bill makes it to his desk. And I am anxious to work with my Senate colleagues on a new version of this bill. This is an important bill. Given the resources, I am confident that Senator MCCONNELL and Senator LEAHY can deliver a bill the Senate will again endorse with wide bipartisan margins.

   Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, teacher quality is one of the most critical factors influencing student achievement and success. I urge my colleagues to support the Kennedy amendment, which would increase Teacher Quality Enhancement grants from $80 million to the fully authorized level of $300 million. 
   I am a cosponsor of this amendment, along with Senator REED of Rhode Island and others, because I firmly believe that an investment in teacher quality is an investment in our children's future. We know all learners have the capacity for high achievement. We must increase our investment in teacher quality enhancement so every child in America is taught by the most qualified teacher available. We must invest in our teachers. We must help them reach the highest levels of competency, so they in turn can help their students reach the highest summits of achievement. As we work to bolster teacher quality, we must also focus our attention on reducing class size. Smaller classes have led to dramatic gains in student achievement. We must continue to reduce class size so highly qualified teachers can provide students more individualized attention. Reducing class size and increasing investment in teacher quality enhancement are key to ensuring academic success for all students.

   Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise to speak to the Labor-HHS appropriations bill that is currently on the floor. Our colleagues, Senator HARKIN and Senator SPECTER, have done a yeoman's job of trying to put together a bill under extremely difficult circumstances for sure. They have been left with their bill until last, and every other appropriations bill has taken funds from this appropriations item. We are now left with a bill that we actually don't know how it is going to be funded. I have heard a lot of funding schemes, from taking money from defense, forward funding, a 13th month, to declaring emergencies. Basically, we are left with funding education, funding health research with money that is not real, that we don't know from where it is coming. 
   We don't know what budget it is coming from or whether it is actually there. So I have a great concern about the reality of the funds for the most important funding we do in this body, that of educating our children, that for health care. 
   Again, we are debating the appropriations bill that funds some of the most important things in the lives of families across this country. Certainly education is a top priority of every family. They have said they want us to make sure the Federal Government does its part to assure that every child, no matter who they are or where they come from, what their background is, what school they are in, gets a good education. 
   We have fought hard in this body on the issues that make a difference in a child's classroom. Last year, 1 year ago, this body, in a bipartisan way, with the House agreed in the final appropriations bill, the omnibus bill, to reduce class size. It is a major priority of this Congress and of this country. We appropriated $1.2 billion to reduce class sizes in first, second, and third grades. That decision was applauded across this country by parents, by teachers, by business leaders, and by communities. 
   Today, those teachers, nearly 30,000 of them, are teaching in our public schools. I had the opportunity last Monday to visit one of the classrooms in Tacoma School District. Tacoma School District has taken the class size funds we allocated and, in 57 first grade classrooms, they have reduced the class size to 15. I had the opportunity to sit down with those 15 children in the first grade classroom and talk to their teacher. She was ecstatic. She said, compared to a class she had worked in before with 27 children: I didn't know all of the kids. I didn't have the opportunity on a daily basis to sit down with them to find out where they were. 
   I didn't have the opportunity as I worked with them throughout the year to make sure every child was keeping up. 
   She said: Today, with 15 kids in my classroom, and only 10 days of classroom time at the beginning of the year, I know where every child is. I know what their skills are. I know what they need to work on, and I can guarantee as a teacher that by the end of this year every child in my classroom will be reading, will have the basic skills, and will be able to move on to second grade ready to learn. 
   That is the goal we set when we allocated those funds 1 year ago. 
   That is why I was so saddened to see, in the bill that comes before us, no money allocated to continue that program to reduce class size in first, second, and third grades; no money; zeroed out; no money to continue those teachers. 
   Essentially, this bill fires the nearly 30,000 teachers who have been hired since 1 year ago who work in our classrooms to educate our students. This is an incredible step backwards. We did agree 1 year ago that we need to focus on kids in the early grades, that we need to do what we can to make sure that they learn reading, that they learn math, that they learn those basic skills so they can be productive in the outyears. 
   We know from the studies that have been done that reducing class size in the first, second, and third grades works. We know students from small class sizes have enrolled in more college-bound courses such as foreign languages and advanced math and science. We know students in smaller class sizes have higher grade point averages. We know students in small classes have fewer discipline problems. We know students in small classes have lower dropout rates. It makes sense for us to continue to make sure that class sizes in first, second, and third grades are reduced, and that we continue the commitment we began 1 year ago. 
   Our initial commitment was $1.1 billion. We agreed that we would add $200 million to that--that is the President's request--so that we can continue to expand and hire 8,000 more teachers. But under the bill that is before us, there is no money to reduce class size. There is no commitment to continue to hire those teachers or to retain those teachers. 
   Essentially, the language as written in this bill says we will fire 30,000 teachers at the end of this school year. Not on my watch. Not on my watch are we going to go back on a commitment we made 1 year ago. Not on my watch are we going to send a message to young students that we no longer care about making sure they get the basic skills they need; that no longer is this Senate going to stand behind the dollars and the commitments we made 1 year ago; that no longer are we going to tell teachers they can count on us and they can count on our word when we tell them this is the commitment we are going to make to them. 
   I have had the opportunity to talk with many teachers around my State and around my country. These teachers have been hired. They are in our classrooms. Forty-three percent of the teachers we have hired are teaching in first grade. Their class sizes are going to be reduced from an average of 22.9 to an average of 17.6 students--from 22 down to 17. And every teacher will tell you that for one less student they have in the classroom, the more time they have to spend with each individual student. Twenty-three percent of the teachers are teaching in second grade, and class sizes in second grades across this 
   country are being reduced an average of 23.2 to an average of 18.1. Twenty-four percent of the teachers are teaching in third grade, and class sizes will be reduced from an average of 23.5 to an average of 18.3 for third graders in classrooms across the country. 
   The money we allocated last year is being spent. We are getting overwhelming responses from teachers, parents, business leaders, and communities that have this class size money in place and are beginning to see the results of it. They are ecstatic. These teachers are in the classrooms. They are teaching. They are appalled that we are going to go back on our word; that this money is not going to continue to be there so that we continue the commitment we made 1 year ago. 
   I have numbers from many of our States across the country where class size dollars have been put into place and where teachers are beginning to see the real results of what we did 1 year ago. I think one of the things we haven't talked about is the fact that when we put this program in place, we said--unlike the block grants, unlike many other programs--we want to make sure administration and paperwork are not going to hamper these dollars actually going into the classroom. 
   The class size money that we put into place last year takes one form for a school district--one form, and a few minutes of an administrator's time. That is all it takes for the dollars we allocated, the $1.2 billion going directly to hire teachers. This is real money being used in real classrooms. Unlike block grants and other programs that we have, we can keep track of where this money is. We know the money is being used to hire teachers. We know that a portion of it is being used to train teachers to give them the skills they need. We know the real money is being used in a way that we can come back and test it and hold it accountable and show that our kids are learning because of something we did in the Senate.  
   As a result of the work we did a year ago, 1.7 million children are now benefiting from smaller class sizes this year. More than 29,000 teachers have been hired with that money. Forty-three percent of them are teaching in the first grade, twenty-three percent are teaching in the second grade, and twenty-four percent are teaching in the third grade. 
   In Anchorage, AK, very far from here, they received $1.8 million under our Class Size Reduction Program and lowered their average first grade class from 22 to 18 by hiring 40 new first grade teachers. 
   If the District loses its funding under this bill, the 40 recently hired teachers will be laid off, and they will return their class sizes back to 22 students. And, more importantly, if it ends next year, little will have been gained. 
   According to Bruce Johnson, Deputy Commissioner of the State Department of Education and Early Development in Anchorage, a 1-year project, he said, generally doesn't yield dramatic results. In Mesa, AR, the Mesa public schools serving 70,000 students received $1.1 million in class size reduction funds. Half of it was used to hire new full-time teachers to reduce their class sizes, and the other half was used to provide reading instruction, an important goal for small groups of children. 
   Without these continued funds, we are facing a real dilemma. Superintendents are under the gun to get their class 
   sizes down. But at the same time they have this concern about what will happen if they hire new teachers and the Federal money runs out. That is a quota, according to the executive director of the Arizona school administrator. 
   San Francisco, CA, has been working very hard to reduce class size in the early grades for many years, and they requested a waiver. I say that all the school districts that have requested a waiver have received one. Because they already focused their money on the early grades, they were allowed the flexibility under the dollars we spent last year, and want to continue to spend this year, to reduce class sizes up to the eighth grade. 
   With these funds, San Francisco hired 37 teachers and reduced their class sizes from 33 to 22. In English and in math, they reduced their class sizes to 20, and they used the funds to provide training for teachers on how to work effectively in smaller classes. 
   Whenever I talk to young students who are in a high school math class, they tell me the most frustrating thing they do in a day is have their hand raised for an entire 50-minute period and never get their question answered. 
   California has already focused their class size reduction money on the early grades. They had the flexibility under our language to reduce class sizes to make gains in K through eighth. Now kids don't sit through a 50-minute period raising their hand, with no answer given, and they don't go home at the end of the day not understanding what happened that day. That is progress because of the work we did, because of the flexibility we offered in this bill, and because we said our national goal is to reduce class size because we know it works. 
   In Boise, ID, they received $547,000 to hire 11 teachers as a result of the Class Size Reduction Program. Some of the teachers will circulate through 10 schools giving students extra help. We have heard from districts that it is a problem because they don't have the classes available to reduce class size. We have allowed them the flexibility, as in Boise, ID, having teachers circulate through the schools so the students get more one-on-one with an adult. Other teachers in Boise were placed in schools with high numbers of low-income students to reduce class size. Boise school administrators will have to lay off the newly hired teachers if they do not receive targeted funding next year. Idaho superintendent Marilyn Howard said this returning of some of our Federal tax dollars to our schools will help support districts' efforts to create smaller classes in the critical early grades. 
   It is our hope this commitment will continue beyond the current year. These teachers are in place. They are working. They are looking to Congress to see whether what we did a year ago was just an empty promise or whether we really meant it when we said that in the United States of America we want our kids to get a better education and we believe an important role of the 
   Federal Government is to provide the partnership and the dollars to reduce class size. It is a very important goal, one that is achievable, one in which we can help to make the commitment, and one to which we can be held accountable at the end of the day. We know where those funds go. We know they don't go to administration. We know they don't go to expensive bureaucratic work. We know they don't go to a lot of paperwork. We know they go to hire teachers to go directly into the classrooms. 
   This money is helping. But in the bill before the Senate today, there is no money for class size reduction, no money whatever. Mr. President, 30,000 teachers will be fired as a direct result of this bill now before the Senate. I cannot stand by and let that happen. I know a number of my colleagues will not stand by and let that happen. 
   In Boston, MA, home of Senator KENNEDY, the Boston public school district received $3.5 million in funding to reduce class size. In the first year, the school district has reduced class sizes in the first and second grades from 28 students to 25 by hiring 40 new teachers. If the Boston public schools were to lose funding targeted to class size reductions, they would not be able to further reduce class sizes to 18 in the first and second grades and they would not be able to reduce class sizes in third and fourth grades, their objective. They would have to lay off all 40 teachers or make deep cuts in other areas of education. 
   That is not a choice we ought to be giving them. We ought to fulfill the commitment we made 1 year ago: Put the money in class size reduction, make the commitment to continue to work to hire 100,000 teachers across the country, and keep the promise everyone made that education is a No. 1 priority and we are not going to underfund it. 
   I know there are other colleagues who want to do block grants. I commend them for their ideas, their passion, and their commitment. If there is a need for additional funds for schools in the form of block grants, I am happy to hear those proposals. Yes, let's provide that additional funding. However, let's not take away the commitment we have made to reduce class size in the first, second, and third grades. It is a national commitment on which we need to follow through. 
   I think what we should recognize is that only 1.6 percent of the entire Federal budget goes to fund education. To take away this $1.2 billion is not the right way to go. I know that my colleagues several years ago passed a sense of the Senate which said we would increase by 1 percent a year the amount of money going to fund education. We have not done that. 
   If some of my colleagues want to offer a block grant, offer additional funds to schools, that is great. However, let's not take away the commitment, let's not take away the promise, let's not take away the investment that is in place right now with teachers hired, with classes being reduced, with young students in early grades across our country now knowing they will be able to learn to read, write, and do math by the end of first and second grades because this Senate, this Congress, in a bipartisan manner, 1 year ago said: We are going to make this happen. Let's not renege on that promise.

Are we, by our votes on the floor of the Senate today, going to lay off nearly 30,000 teachers nationwide to whom we made a commitment 1 year ago to put into our classrooms, who are working today, who are making a difference today, who are connecting with young children one on one today? Are we going to turn around and say to them: Sorry, you no longer have a job?

   Mrs. MURRAY. I think the Senator from Illinois raises a valid point. We have a lot of young students today who would make outstanding teachers, who would be able to contribute to the future of this country in a very positive way by getting a teaching degree and being a teacher in one of our schools. 
   However, if we send the message today that teachers will be in an overcrowded classroom, they are not going to have the support, the backing of Congress and legislatures, and teachers will be sitting in overcrowded classrooms, my guess is, we will have a decreasing number of students willing to work in the public education system.

   Mrs. MURRAY. The Senator from Massachusetts is absolutely correct. Every parent knows smaller class size is important. It is the question they ask their children when they come home on the first day of school: How many kids are in your classroom? They ask that question because every parent knows the smaller the class, the better chance at learning. 
   But the fact is, we want our Federal dollars spent in areas that will really work. We have, as a Senate, looked at studies--the STARS study the Senator from Massachusetts just mentioned--and the fact is, when we spend Federal  dollars and we are partners with our local districts in reducing class size, it makes a difference for our students. 
   As the Senator from Massachusetts said, students in smaller classes have significantly higher grades, as found in a STARS study that followed these kids from the early grades all the way through senior year in high school. In fact, in English, smaller classes had a 76.1-percent average--higher than these. In math it was higher, and in science it was higher. This is real. These dollars make a difference. It means students will learn the skills every one of us wants them to learn, and studies back them up. This money makes a difference.

   Mrs. MURRAY. The Senator from Massachusetts is absolutely correct. I remember the negotiations. I remember everyone coming out in a bipartisan manner, in fact struggling to get their press conferences before their counterparts in the other party, in order to take credit for the class size reduction. 
   Senator GORTON here in the Senate was part of those negotiations. As the Senator mentioned, the House chairman, a Republican, as well as DICK ARMEY, came out and said: We have made progress. We have done something that is important. We are behind the class size reduction. This is a commitment we are going to make. 
   So it is very surprising to me that the House has zeroed out money now and said it is no longer a priority, and here in the Senate bill we are doing the same thing.

   Mrs. MURRAY. The Senator is absolutely correct. What we did with these dollars is, we focused them directly in an area where we know it makes a difference in the learning of children. In addition, unlike many other Federal programs, we made sure it was not spent on bureaucrats or paperwork or administration. These dollars are targeted directly to the classroom. That is why it has been so effective. That is why it is so well loved by so many districts.

   Mrs. MURRAY. The Senator from Massachusetts is correct. I have not seen the editorial. It does not surprise me. I have seen similar editorials, like in Longview, WA, a very small rural community that understands the need to educate their kids because they can no longer rely on the timber jobs that were there maybe even a decade or two decades ago, and they know their kids need to know math and science so they can attract some of the high-tech industries that are coming in and seeing that those kids get the education they need. 
   I have heard from schools in Yakima, WA, a farming community, Everett, a suburban district, right in the heartland of Seattle, Garfield High School, where teachers have said to me: This money is critical, it is targeted, it is used for what we need to do, you can be held accountable for it; don't renege on a promise.

   Mrs. MURRAY. The Senator from Massachusetts brings up another extremely important point. I do not think there is a parent in America whose heart does not stop when they see another television show about another shooting and they worry about their own child. 
   The fact is, when kids are in smaller class sizes in the first, second, and third grades, their tendency toward discipline problems is reduced dramatically. It does make a difference. 
   More important is what a policeman told me not long ago. He said: I watch these families today, and a lot of kids are home alone essentially in the evening. The parents may even be there, but they are essentially home alone. They walk to school in the morning in a neighborhood where the blinds are closed and the doors are closed and not one adult looks out to see if they are OK. They walk to school without anyone paying attention. They get to school, where it is overcrowded, where the only adult in that classroom never has time to look them in the eye or see that they are OK. 
   This policeman said to me: These kids feel anonymous in today's world. It is no surprise they act out violently in order for someone to notice them.

   We do know if we tell our young people that we are going to reduce their class sizes so they can really do the professional job we have asked them to do, and we have a commitment that we are not going to renege on every year, that we believe in this, I believe we will be able to recruit young, great students into the teaching profession, and I think we have a lot of work to do on that. Certainly this is a commitment we need to make.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, the amendment I have sent to the desk corrects a major flaw in the appropriations bill that is currently before the Senate. 
   Last year--1 year ago--in a bipartisan way, Members of the Senate, from both parties, and Members of the House, from both parties, agreed to fund an initiative called Reducing Class Size in the first, second and third grades. This is a commitment we made to hire 30,000 new teachers across the country in the early grades to make sure that these kids learn the basic skills that are so important to them as they begin their education.  
   We did this as a national commitment because we understand that the funds that are directly targeted to the classroom, directly to hire new teachers, directly makes a difference in children's lives, and will mean that we, as Federal partners in providing funds for education will be doing something concrete to make the education of every child in this country better off. It was a bipartisan commitment by both parties. 
   Unfortunately, in the bill that is currently before us, the money that was to be allocated for class size reduction has been put into something called a teacher assistance program that has not been authorized. Unless it has been authorized, the $1.2 billion will be lost. Essentially, what that means is that the newly hired 30,000 teachers who are in their classrooms--one on one, working with young students--at the end of this year will be laid off, if the current bill moves forward as we now have it in front of us. 
   My amendment corrects that flaw. It recommits the Senate, it recommits the Congress to doing what we said was the right thing to do a year ago, and that is reducing class sizes in first, second, and third grades. 
   This idea of reducing class sizes did not come from some bureaucrat in Washington, DC. It came from grassroots organizations across the country, from parents who know that if their child is in a classroom with 30 students throughout the year, they are not going to get the attention they need to have a good education. 
   It came from teachers who told us they were teaching in overcrowded classrooms, with young students coming to them with problems that none of us probably have experienced in our lives but who are in their classrooms, and the teachers do not have the time to deal with those problems when there are 25 or 30 students. 
   As professionals and as educators, they told us that what we could do that would make a difference would be to target money across the country, to add new teachers to lower class sizes which would give them the opportunity to do what they have been educated to do--to teach our young children. 
   This came to us from community leaders who saw the increasing occurrences of violence in youth across their communities, who are saying to us: We want you to do something that makes a difference, that is a reality, where our tax dollars can be held accountable, where we can see a real difference occur because we see too many young people who do 
   not receive any adult attention, who are in overcrowded classrooms, in neighborhoods where no one pays attention to them. They come from families that, for many varied reasons, do not give them the attention they deserve. Reduce class sizes so there is one adult in their lives, in those early grades, who pays attention to them, works with them one on one, and makes a difference. 
   This idea of reducing class sizes came to us from parents and teachers and community leaders who knew that the role of the Federal Government was to be a partner with their State legislature and their local school district to do the right thing for our young students. 
   We did not just pull this out because we imagined it may make a difference. We knew from the studies that have been conducted that reducing class sizes in first, second, and third grades makes a difference. It makes a difference in the learning of our young children. 
   We knew, in fact, that students in smaller classes had significantly higher grades in English, math, and science. This came from a STAR study, a scientific study that took young kids in first, second, and third grades, put them in smaller classes, and then followed them throughout the next 10 years of their education. As they went on, these students, who had been in smaller class sizes to begin with, had significantly higher grades in English, math, and science. They were able to do what all of us want them to do, and that is to learn. 
   So this idea to reduce class size was backed up by science. It was because of studies similar to the STAR study that we knew that putting our Federal resources into hiring teachers was going to have an outcome that actually made a difference in the education and learning of students across this country. It is real and it is there. 
   This is the result of the work we did a year ago. We currently have almost 30,000 teachers now teaching in our classrooms that would not be there if we had not begun this approach a year ago. We need to make sure we follow up on that commitment. 
   How can anyone turn around and now say: Well, what we did a year ago was an empty promise at the end of the year. We got tied up in a budget negotiation. We did not mean it. 
   How do you say to the teacher that I met in Tacoma a week ago--with a class of 15 first graders as a result of what we did--that it was just an empty promise, that we did it on a whim, that we had to do it? We need to say to that teacher: We meant it then and we mean it now. We know that having 15 first graders in your classroom is going to make a difference. We agree with you as a professional, with you as a teacher, when you look me in the eye as a legislator and say: These kids are going to get an education this year. 
   She said to me: I want you to make sure you continue this program so it isn't just a 1-year program, that every child in the first grade in the United States of America knows that they are going to learn to read, that every parent who sends their child to a first grade classroom will have the commitment from us that we are doing something in reality that makes a difference for their classrooms. 
   I know that we are going to be second-degreed. I know another amendment is coming that will block grant these funds and say: Sure, this money is still going to go out to the districts, but that does not touch what parents are asking us to do, that does not touch what teachers are asking us to do. 
   They said: You as a Federal Government, you as our national leaders, have said that reducing class size is a priority and you are behind it. Tell us that is true, and follow through on that commitment. Don't let it get lost in the bureaucracies of block grants. Don't let it get lost in the politics that happen between where you are and where we are. Please make sure that the money stays there for our teachers. 
   This is a program we know works. We know that in a lot of block grants the money gets lost in administration and bureaucracy and paperwork. When we passed this legislation to reduce class size, we did it in a way that makes sure the paperwork is minimal. In fact, it is a one-page form that school districts fill out. It takes an administrator 10 minutes--no bureaucracy involved. That class-size money that we began a year ago--$1.2 billion--gets directed all the way into a classroom. 
   The money doesn't go to bureaucracy and paperwork. It goes to a teacher in a classroom with young kids, giving them time, one on one, to be together and to learn and to be educated. 
   That is what we all want. That is what is important for our country's future. That is what is going to make a difference 15 years from now when those young kids graduate. Instead of being a dropout, instead of having discipline problems, instead of not going on to college, we know from studies we have seen that these children have a much higher rate of being successful. 
   Our economy will be better because these children have had that kind of attention. Our education system will be finally working, and we can sit back--15 years from now, 12 years from now--and take credit for doing something that is real. If we block grant this money and send it out there, none of us can say we made a difference. We won't know. But we do know because it is something that is wanted by parents; it is wanted by teachers; it is wanted by community leaders; it is wanted by grassroots people who are in the classroom working with our young children, and it is part of what we have a responsibility to do at the Federal level. 
   We spend only 1.6 percent of the Federal budget on education. That is appalling. If my colleagues on the other side of the aisle want to add a block grant fund that adds to what we have done in the past, I am all for it. I want to hear about it. I want to hear what it is targeted for. I want to hear what its purpose is. I want to know it is going to make a difference in education. I am delighted to join in that discussion. 
   But to rob from the Class Size Initiative to add a new program they have developed, I say that is wrong. We know the class size money we put into  effect a year ago is in the classrooms and working. We know a year from now we can be held accountable for that. We know there are 1.7 million children today who are in a smaller class size, getting the skills they need and being taught what they need, having an adult pay attention to them and whom we won't be able to look at if this bill follows through and takes away the Class Size Reduction Initiative we began 1 year ago. 
   This is an important commitment. It was an important promise a year ago. It is an important promise today. I hope this Senate will step back and say we have a responsibility as Federal legislators to work with our States, to work with our local governments, to reduce class size, and we are going to ante up our part. We are going to put the resources behind our rhetoric. We are going to put $1.4 billion into class size reduction, keep those 30,000 teachers we have hired, add 8,000 new ones, and, a year from now, know we can look back and say we have made a difference--we have made a tremendous difference. We have told a lot of kids, probably more than 2 million, a year from now, if we do this right, that we care about them; that we want them to have the attention they deserve; we believe their education is important; we believe it is more important than just words and rhetoric and empty promises; we are going to live up to the commitments we have given. I urge my colleagues to support the amendment before us. 
   We have a number of Senators who are going to come and debate this amendment. We will be talking about this for the next several hours. I will retain the remainder of my time at this point and allow the Senator from Washington to send his amendment forward.

It was passed in a bipartisan manner last year. One form, one page takes one administrator a few minutes to fill out, and the class size money goes directly to hire teachers. Our Federal tax dollars go to pay for the teacher in the classroom--no bureaucracy, no big charts. The money goes to make a difference. That is why we believe it is the right way to go.

   Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, we are coming to the end of this debate. Everybody needs to step back and remember why we are here, and that is that 1 year ago, in a bipartisan manner, both Houses--the Senate and the House--agreed to work toward funding 100,000 new teachers in the early grades, first through third grades. 
   Everybody took credit a year ago. In fact, I have a copy of the Republican Policy Committee, ``Accomplishments During the 105th Congress.'' This is what they put out, and right on the second page, they take credit for the 30,000 new teachers we funded with the $1.2 billion. They take credit and say: This is one of their accomplishments. They say:  
   This omnibus FY 1999 funding bill provides $1.2 billion in additional educational funds, funds controlled 100 percent at the local level--  
   Despite the rhetoric you have heard today--  
   to recruit, hire, train, and test teachers. This provision-- 
   They said a year ago--  
   is a major first step toward returning to local school officials the ability to make the educational decisions for our children, rather than the bureaucrats in Washington.  
   I did not say that; our Republican colleagues said that a year ago when they passed the $1.2 billion with us to reduce class sizes. 
   In the past year, we have put 30,000 new teachers into our classrooms. Why was that an initiative that we all felt was important? Because we know it makes a difference. We know that students in smaller class sizes enroll in more college-bound courses, they have higher grade point averages, they have fewer discipline problems, and they have lower drop-out rates. 
   The commitment we began last year is making a difference for our students,  it is making a difference in our classrooms, and it will make a difference for our economy and for this country's future. It is a program that is working. 
   I ask my colleagues: Why have so many people opposed it today when 1 year ago they said it was a major accomplishment in turning money back to local school districts? Why are they opposing it? 
   Perhaps they do not want any Federal involvement in our education. I disagree. The Federal Government is a partner. They are a partner with our State and local governments, with our teachers, our students, our families. We made a commitment a year ago, and we are about to renege on that right now. If my amendment is not agreed to, and a year from now 30,000 teachers get their pink slips and we have students, 1.7 million children, who are returned to larger classrooms, everyone in this Congress will have failed to do the right thing for our children. 
   The Class Size Reduction Initiative was the right thing to do a year ago. Everyone said so. It is still the right thing to do today. It is a commitment we have made to the families in this country that, yes, we will live up to what their expectations are of us, that education is a priority, that we are willing to put our money behind our rhetoric. 
   My colleague from Washington, Senator GORTON, has offered an alternative, and I say to my Republican colleagues, if they want to introduce a new block grant program and tell us what it is, perhaps we will be willing to help them. But we are not willing to take 30,000 teachers out of our classrooms, and we are not willing to say to the families in this country that we 
   are not with you in making sure that every child in this country, no matter who they are or where they come from, will learn. We are willing to do our part. 
   I urge my colleagues to support the Murray amendment and oppose the Gorton amendment and do the right thing for children and families in this country.

   Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, what is most appalling to me is that we have left the Labor, Health, and Human Services bill to the very last. This bill is extremely important to every family in this country. It funds everything from health care to NIH research to education, key programs that we are responsible for at the Federal level, being a partner in making sure every child in this country gets an education so they can be successful. 
   Last night, we referenced the Subcommittee on Labor, Health, and Human Services. We were unable to offer any amendments, and I was disappointed in that. I was pleased that the Republicans put forward a budget that does appear--and I use the word ``appear''--to fund education at much better levels than the House, and we are grateful for that. We have been out here on the floor innumerable times saying education is a top priority and in this budget we want to make sure that happens. Surely our colleagues have listened to this, and the numbers on the paper show they have. However, what is underneath those numbers is very disconcerting to me, and it should be very disconcerting to every parent and every family across this country. 
   Let me talk for a minute about a very important initiative we passed last year to reduce class size in the first, second, and third grades. 
   It was a bipartisan effort. We negotiated with our Republican colleagues. Every Member in the Senate and House voted for it and agreed with us that reducing class size would make tremendous gains in education across this country. In the budget that is put forward that the Labor Committee will be hearing this afternoon, I do not see any class-size money. This money has been taken away. The 30,000 new teachers who have been hired this year who are in our classrooms looking our children in the eyes as we speak will be fired if we pass this Labor bill as it now appears before us. 
   I do see $1.2 billion for something called teacher assistance initiative. We have no idea what that is. Clearly, it is not class-size reduction. We do not have any idea what it is, and it is subject to authorization, meaning essentially those dollars will never come forward. If that is the case, this bill is terribly underfunded when it comes to education and the needs of families across our country. But I am very concerned that the class-size money has been taken out of this budget. 
   I simply cannot support going out and firing 5,000 teachers across this country. These teachers are in place today. This was a commitment we made in the Senate 1 year ago when we told them we were going to work with them to reduce class size. 
   Why did we say we wanted to reduce class size? Because we know that students from small classes enroll in more college-bound courses such as foreign languages, advanced math, and science. This has been proven. We know students in small class sizes in first, second, and third grades have higher grade point averages. We know they have fewer discipline problems. And we know they have lower drop-out rates. 
   We knew that last year so we said as a Federal Government we were going to begin a process of hiring 100,000 new teachers across this country so students in the first, second, and third grade can have the attention they need and the teacher time they need to learn the basic skills of English, math, and science. We know those kids who come from those classes will do better. 
   Smaller class sizes mean higher grades, more kids will be able to compete when they graduate from high school, more kids will be successful, and more students will less likely have discipline problems and, as we all know, turn to violence as a means of making their voices heard. 
   We are going to fight for class size on this side of the aisle. We want those teachers who have been hired and those children in those classrooms to know what we said a year ago will not be taken away because it is a new year. We want them to know we are committed to education, we are committed to being the partner we are supposed to be, and it is not just for today, it is for tomorrow. 
   Numbers and rhetoric on a piece of paper do not educate a child. Making sure our kids are in classes that are small enough and that we have the dollars and commitment is critical, and making sure school construction is part of what we do--and there is no money in this bill for school construction--and making sure each child knows we care about them is critical. The Senator from California has been out on the floor many times to talk about afterschool programs, which are funded in this bill but less than what the President requested. 
   We are pleased the Republicans have brought us a budget with the numbers on a piece of paper, but we want to know that those commitments are real, that 
   those teachers are not going to lose their jobs because of some rhetoric on the floor this year and smoke and mirrors and no funding, and we do not know how it is all going to happen in the end and, gee, 6 months from now, gosh, the program is gone. We want it real, we want language now, we want numbers now, and we want to tell our kids we care about them in a manner that is true. That is for what the Democrats are going to be fighting. I thank my colleagues on this side of the aisle.

   Mrs. MURRAY. The Senator from California is absolutely correct. They took the number of $1.2 billion, which we passed last year and were supposed to continue this year, to reduce class size, only our commitment was to increase that to $1.4 billion so we would add on to those 30,000 teachers until we reached our verbal commitment of having 100,000 new teachers. 
   On paper, they took the $1.2 billion and put it into something called teacher assistance initiative. I have never heard of that. I do not know what it is. I have seen no language about it. I can tell my colleague one thing: sitting on the education committee in the Senate, it is not a program anyone knows about, and the language in the bill says  it is authorized, meaning we are going to have to go through hearings, pass a bill through the Senate and the House, and have it signed by the President before we leave in a few short weeks, and I just do not see that happening. Really it is smoke and mirrors.

   Mrs. MURRAY. The Senator from California is correct. I was out in one of my school buildings last Monday, a school in Tacoma, where they have taken their class-size money for first, second, and third grades and put it all into the first grade, and the first grade teachers have 15 students. 
   Each one of those kids in those 57 classrooms will read at the end of this year. You can see it in 10 days of classroom instruction. These kids were moving ahead rapidly, and they were going to be reading. Contrast that with a class of 30 kids where maybe part will be able to read at the end of the year and, obviously, some will not. They move on to second grade, and the second grade teacher starts all the way back at the beginning with the kids who are at the bottom. 
   These 57 classrooms and those 15 kids in each of those classrooms will know how to read, and that second grade teacher next year can move them on from there. It is going to make a tremendous difference. 
   Those teachers pleaded with me not to lose funds so they can continue to do the job they have been trained to do.

   Mrs. MURRAY. The Senator from California is correct. There is zero for school construction. What kind of message is that for our young kids, who are sitting in public schools, to show that we care about them, and that we are paying attention to them, and that we believe their education is important. 
   It is hard to pass that message along when you are sitting in classrooms with a leaky roof, with no new desks, with materials that are inappropriate, that are not good for education. A child goes home and says: The adults in my world don't care about me. 
   We all know the results of that. There is not a dime in this bill for school construction.

   Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I thank the Democratic leader for an excellent statement and for reminding all Members why we are here on a Monday evening debating this issue: The American public has said education is its No. 1 priority. It ought to be the No. 1 priority of the Senate. 
   I have been delighted to hear the rhetoric from both sides throughout this year that education is the No. 1 priority. That is why I am so disappointed tonight. Clearly, the budget priorities we now see show education has dropped to last. It is the last appropriations bill to be considered. It is the appropriations bill we have been using from which to steal the funds throughout this entire process. Who gets hurt in the end? It is our children. 
   I listened to a Senator a few minutes ago saying this is a debate about philosophy. I agree. It is a philosophy about whether or not just a few kids in our country get a good education or whether we are going to make sure every child, no matter who they are or where they come from, gets a good education and how we do that. 
   In talking to parents across this country, they are not saying eliminate bureaucracy; they are not saying block grant the programs. They are saying: Make sure my child can learn to read and write. They are saying: If my child is in a smaller classroom in first, second, and third grade and gets the attention they need, they will get a good education. They will learn how to read and write; they will be a success. 
   They are asking Congress to partner with their State and local governments to reduce class size. They are asking Congress to make sure our teachers are given the skills they need to teach the young kids in our classrooms. They are asking Congress to put the resources behind the rhetoric. 
   When I tell people in my State and across this country that 1.6 percent of the Federal budget goes to education, something they believe is a priority, they are appalled. Education needs to be funded at a level where every child can learn to read and write and be a success in this world. This Congress is failing. 
   I was extremely disappointed with the House appropriations bill that passed out of committee last week; it eliminated the Eisenhower Teacher Professional Development Program. That is a program that is geared to helping our teachers teach the basics of math and science. Talk to the new startup businesses and the businesses that are succeeding. They say our kids need to learn math and science. 
   That is what the Eisenhower Grant Program is all about. I met with some scientists in my home State just a few months ago, leaders in the biotech industry, leaders in the technology industry. They spent an evening with me, of their own time, because they wanted to tell me how great the Eisenhower teacher professional development grants were, what they have done for students in our local high schools, invigorated them and got them to go on to science and math in college. They wanted to make sure we continued this program. 
   What did the House do last week? They took the money out. It is gone. No longer are we saying to schools across this country that making sure we have math and science students who succeed is important. That is wrong. 
   What else did they do? They eliminated the Goals 2000 Program. This is a program that helps school districts fund their own locally-designed programs to help student achievement by improving the quality of teacher training. Every one of us knows, if you want your company to succeed, you make sure your employees have the best skills they can to work for you. That is what we need to be doing with our teachers. We need to be training them. We need to be making sure they have the skills they need to pass on to our young students today. That is what  Goals 2000 is about. The House eliminated it. 
   The Class Size Reduction Initiative? Eliminated in the House budget. When I went out to my State just a few weeks ago, I went to a school in Tacoma, WA, where they had taken the Class Size Reduction Initiative money we had given them and focused it entirely on the first grade classrooms in the Tacoma school districts. Today, this year, 57 schools in Tacoma, WA, have 15 students in their first grade classrooms. They then used their title I money to help train those teachers in literacy efforts. Their focus this year is to make sure every first grade student can read at the end of the year. That is an amazing program. We are making it happen with the class size reduction money that was passed with bipartisan support a year ago. We are going to now take that away and tell those students and tell those teachers we no longer are going to help them do what they told me was absolutely critical? 
   As you can see behind me on this chart, K-12 enrollments are increasing dramatically right now. Why are we, then, reducing the levels of support for these students? We have to make sure every child gets the resources he or she needs. We have to make sure the local communities have the resources behind them. We at the Federal level are a partner with our State and our local governments to make sure our kids learn. We want to know their classes are small enough that kids can learn to read and write and do math. We want to know those teachers are trained. We want to know there are afterschool programs so our students do not go home alone, to their neighborhoods, alone where they are not learning or where they are unproductive or can get in trouble. That is what the Democrats have been fighting for. That is what we will continue to fight for. 
   We know the rhetoric is not going to educate one child. We know all of the bills with big names are not going to educate one child. We do know the dollars--behind reducing class size, training our teachers, Eisenhower grants--make a difference. School districts are held accountable for making sure our kids learn, and we are making sure we have the resources behind those efforts to make sure it happens. 
   This debate is important. The debate tonight in the Appropriations Committee is even more important--whether we are willing to put those dollars behind those students. I think it is appalling that our kids have been left to last in the budget process, that they are going to be funded by smoke and mirrors. We will not see the reality of this for probably several months, but it will happen. When this is all said and done, if we do not put the dollars behind our students and our teachers and our schools, our kids will get the message. They will get the message that we do not care. I do not want to be sending that message; I do not think anybody here does. 
   I have listened to the rhetoric. I have heard every Senator come out and say education is critical. If that is the truth, let's pass the Daschle amendment, go to work and make sure our kids have the resources they need to be productive in the next century. 
   I yield the floor. 
   Mr. VOINOVICH addressed the Chair.

   Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I am very concerned about the provisions in this bill reorganizing the Department of Energy. In particular, I fear we are returning to the days of DOE ``self regulation'', which has historically translated into ``no regulation'' for environment, health and safety laws. 
   Senator WARNER and I will enter into a colloquy later that I hope will clarify the intent of this legislation regarding provisions critical to the safety of our workers and communities. We are particularly concerned about the autonomy of the newly-created, largely independent ``National Nuclear Security Administration.'' We fear the creation of NNSA will recreate the institutional conditions that resulted in 50 years of  environmental, safety, and health mismanagement at DOE facilities--estimated to cost up to $200 billion to clean up. Hanford alone now receives appropriations of about $1 billion/year to clean up the legacy left from decades of the Atomic Energy Commission and/or Department of Energy self-regulation.

   Mrs. MURRAY. Unfortunately, 46 State Attorneys General have written voicing their ``serious concerns'' with many of this bill's provisions. They fear title XXXII of the bill would ``weaken the existing internal and external oversight structure for DOE's environmental, safety and health operations.'' 
   I am very concerned about the DOE restricting provisions of this bill and so am tempted to vote against it. However, there are many provisions in the DOD authorization bill that will strengthen our country, our national defense, and our cleanup programs at DOE sites. I am particularly proud to support our belated efforts to increase the pay of our military personnel. 
   In addition, I very much appreciate Chairman WARNER's agreement to enter into the colloquy that follows. Therefore, I will support this bill in the hopes that this colloquy and the public comments made by drafters of title XXXII will ensure continuing compliance with environment, safety, and health laws and orders by the NNSA. 
   I hope we can go back to the drawing board on the DOE restructuring provisions either through a veto of the bill this year or a new attempt to craft a better solution next year. 
   Thank you, again, Chairman WARNER for your work on the overall bill and your colloquy with me on the important subject of protecting our communities and environment at DOE facilities.

   Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I would like to enter into a colloquy regarding Title XXXII of the bill regarding Department of Energy restructuring. I understand the intent of this title was to improve security at Department facilities. Unfortunately, I am concerned that some of the language might cause confusion with regard to the obligation of the National Nuclear Security Administration to comply with environmental laws. From remarks I have seen in the popular press, I understand this was not the author's intent and I would like to clarify several provisions.

   Mrs. MURRAY. It is clear then that this provision does not affect the obligation of the Administrator of the NNSA and the Secretary of Energy, to comply with existing environmental laws and DOE environmental orders. Indeed, it makes explicit NNSA's legal obligation to comply with all applicable environmental laws and regulations, and provides that the Administrator of the NNSA has primary responsibility and accountability for environmental compliance programs at NNSA facilities. Furthermore, Section 3261 does not affect or abrogate existing waivers of sovereign immunity in environmental laws. Finally, Section 3261 retains the Secretary of Energy's existing authority over environmental compliance issues at the nine sites that will be incorporated into the NNSA. If compliance problems arise, the Secretary may investigate them, which can include requesting the assistance of staff from DOE's Environmental Management or Environmental, Health & Safety programs, and impose corrective actions when the Secretary identifies deficiencies. Is this a correct interpretation?

   Mrs. MURRAY. I rise to request a colloquy with my colleague from Washington State, Senator GORTON.  
   On June 10, 1999, 277,000 gallons of gasoline leaded from an underground pipeline in Bellingham, Washington. It ignited and exploded. Three people were killed: an 18-year-old young man and two 10-year-old boys. This is a tragedy. 
   The Office of Pipeline Safety, the National Transportation Safety Board, the FBI, the EPA and State agencies have spent the last four months trying to determine why this happened. We still don't know the direct cause and may not know for some time. 
   I wish I could say this was an isolated instance, but I can't. Recent pipeline accidents have occurred in other places. In Edison, New Jersey, one person died when a natural gas pipeline exploded. In Texas, two people lost their lives when a butane release ignited. In fact, last November the owner of the pipeline that exploded in Bellingham had an accident in another part of my State that took six lives. 
   These pipelines are potential threats. There are some 160,000 miles of pipelines in the U.S. carrying hazardous materials. Many of these pipes run under some of our most densely populated areas; under our schools, our homes, and our businesses. 
   I am disappointed that this year the Transportation Appropriations Subcommittee did not adequately fund the Office of Pipeline Safety, the authority governing interstate pipelines. I tried to get the appropriations in this year's bill to the level requested by the President. Unfortunately, we were unable to do so. It is my hope we can increase funding in next year's appropriations. 
   I am also committed to strengthening OSP's oversight of pipelines and commitment to community safety in next year's reauthorization of OPS. 
   I will be working with Senator GORTON, who is on the committee, to ensure greater OPS effectiveness and oversight of the industry. 
   I also want to point out U.S. Transportation Secretary Rodney Slater's prompt attention to this issue. Immediately following the accident, he met with me and granted my request to have a full-time OPS inspector stationed in Washington State. He has also been very helpful and informative as we've progressed through the investigation phase. I thank him. I know he will continue to work with us in the future on OPS's appropriations and next year's authorization.

   Mrs. MURRAY. I thank my colleague. I will also continue to push for reform. We must take a long hard look at the effectiveness of OSP's oversight activities; review ways to develop new technologies for detecting pipeline defects; consider the effect of aging pipelines on safety; review industry's influence on the regulation of pipelines; and focus on our training and testing procedures for inspectors and maintenance workers. I also intend to look at ways to treat environmentally sensitive and highly populated areas, recognizing the multitude of safety and ecological problems operating pipelines in these places can create. 
   Finally, I will work to strengthen communities' ``right to know,'' so people are aware when there are problems with the pipelines that threaten their neighborhoods.

   Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I thank Senator HARKIN for his statement and his commitment to education and the tremendous job he is doing to do the right thing, to get education back as the top priority of this Senate and not the last priority. I very much appreciate his strong words and his work, and I look forward to working with him. 
   Mr. President, I remind my colleagues, at the beginning of this year,--as we were discussing budget priorities--virtually every Member of this Chamber--Republican and Democrat--came before you to say how important education is. I was proud to see that the issues that American families talk about around the kitchen table were finally being talked about here on the Senate floor. 
   As the year has progressed, however, we have seen that it was just that--a lot of talk and no action. Members have not matched their talk about education funding with actual funds. 
   For example, earlier this year, the budget chairman indicated he would increase funding for education and training by $5.6 billion. Including yesterday's actions on VA-HUD appropriations, we are now looking at--not an increase of $5.6 billion--but a decrease of more than $15 billion in education funding from last year. 
   How are we going to look the American public in the eye and honestly say that we are doing what we have promised? 
   This Congress has turned its back on the bipartisan commitment we made only last year. Schools in my State--and all across the country--are using the Federal money we appropriated last year to hire more teachers right now. And it is working. But the current budget process cuts this progress off at the knees. 
   A budget document is a statement of our values. When you look at the budgets that have come out this year, they show that Congress' values don't match Americans' values. How can we say that education is a priority if it receives only 1.6 percent of Federal spending? 
   I cannot in good conscience sit quietly as this Congress goes back on its word and ignores the priorities of the American public. 
   This is the most important discussion we can have right now. School is back in session, and people are talking about improving education. Only Congress is not listening. 
   Sometimes in this Chamber it is hard to hear what our actions sound like across the country. Let me tell you what it sounds like to my constituents. They have told me in no uncertain terms that education funding matters. 
   The people are speaking, but Congress is not listening. 
   The American people have said that our children should not sit in overcrowded classrooms. When a child's hand goes up in the classroom, we all want the teacher to be able to focus on that child's question. 
   What is Congress's reply? The Republican budget will cut education funding by more than 17 percent and guarantee that we keep our children in overcrowded classrooms. 
   The people are speaking, but Congress is not listening. 
   The American people have said that our teachers should be well-trained and have the most recent skills and resources to meet today's complex  needs-- 
   including knowing how to use technology to boost student achievement. 
   What is Congress' reply? The Republican budget will cut education funding by more than 17 percent and guarantee that we cannot give our students the well-trained teachers they deserve. The people are speaking; Congress is not listening. 
   The American people have said they want their children to learn in modern schools, not schools where plugging in a computer blows all the electrical circuits. What is Congress' reply? The Republican budget will cut education funding by more than 17 percent and guarantee that we will not be able to modernize our aging schools. The people are speaking; Congress is not listening. 
   Over the past year, one place where our children should be the safest, our schools, has become a home to unspeakable acts of violence. At the end of last school year, we had tragedies in Colorado and Georgia. The American people have told us they want their children to be safe in school. What is Congress' reply? The Republican budget will cut education funding by more than 17 percent and guarantee that we take away resources for safe and drug-free schools now, when we need them the most. The people are speaking; Congress is not listening. 
   When my colleagues say they are listening to the American people, they must be listening with their hands over their ears because they aren't getting the message. 
   Let me be clear: Cutting education funding by more than 17 percent is not what the American people want. It is not what our students need, and it is not what this Congress said it would do. 
   Why do I feel so strongly about this? Because making sure that we invest in public education and prepare our students and our country for tomorrow is at the core of who I am and why I am a United States Senator. When I was raising my children and my State was about to cut a small but very essential preschool program, I started talking to people around me about how we could keep that program. It wasn't very long before I had 15,000 people behind me making their voices heard in my State capital to save that preschool program. We fought very hard over a very small program, and we prevailed. The program wasn't cut, and today it is still helping students as it has been for the past 40 years. 
   These same parents and parents like them from around my State have responded so deeply to the need to invest in education that they sent me to the school board, the State senate, and now to the United States Senate. I stand before you as a person with a mission--to make sure that policymakers across this country do not walk away from their responsibility to the future of America and that they understand the importance of the Federal education dollar. 
   Since I have been in the Senate, I have noticed a change. Because of the efforts of Members like myself, TOM HARKIN, TED KENNEDY, CHRIS DODD, BARBARA BOXER, JACK REED, and Republicans such as Senator JEFFORDS and others, this body is finally talking about education in a way that it never has before. This Chamber's discussion is more reflective of the discussions that go on around kitchen tables all over this country. But you don't get points for talk alone. 
   I am sure that after my remarks today, some Members of this body will come here to say our public schools are failing, and they will paint us all a picture of woe and despair. The truth 
   is, our public schools are doing a good job educating our children, and they are doing that good work in the face of enormous challenges today. 
   I have to say it again because it has never been more clear: Our public schools have not failed us, but if we don't stop this Republican budget, we will be failing our public schools. 
   The American people say education should be the highest priority. This Congress is making it our last priority. The American people say education should be our first priority. This Congress made it the last bill we will debate, after all the dollars have been spent, and there is only a little bit of spare change left. 
   Some of the proposals out there would have you believe that we can solve everything just by making our Federal programs more flexible. We all want our programs to be flexible. But you can have all the flexibility in the world, and it won't solve our education problems. Our schools need resources and our schools need funding. 
   The education budget has been left for the last. When we go home in a month, how will we explain the resulting decisions to our constituents? Which 17 percent of the kids are we going to say are not worth educating? To which 17 percent of the parents and families are we going to say: Sorry, we didn't have enough money to teach your child? Which 17 percent of schools are not worth making safe, secure, and drug free? 
   We cannot waste a single student. Even though it is very late in the game, and there is a lot of work to be done, we can turn this around. We can still decide to keep our word on education and to keep in step with the wishes of the American public. 
   It is not too late. I urge all of my colleagues to act now to increase education funding and do right by our children. 
   I thank the Chair and suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mrs. MURRAY. I thank the Senator for bringing up this headline. I, too, was struck by this new concept of adding a month to our calendar in order to solve the problems of the country. I agree, it has to be humorous; otherwise, we would all be crying. 
   Because, truly, when I go home what my constituents tell me is what I think everyone is hearing: We have priorities in this country, particularly education. They are worried about preschool. They are worried about Head Start. They are worried about whether or not their child is in a class that is small enough that they get the individual attention they need. They are worried about whether or not their teachers have the kind of training they need to teach their children. They certainly are worried about school construction and the ability to send their child to a safe school. 
   We had a whole hearing this morning about school violence. But teachers have not come to me and said: How do we add this to our curriculum, explaining a whole new month that has been added by the Senate? 
   I know my colleague has worked with me on the Budget Committee for the last 7 years. We have worked very hard to reduce the deficit. There was a $300 billion deficit when we arrived here in 1993. 
   We worked hard to be real. Despite the humor we have in this debate today, we need to get real about the budget; we need to get real about our priorities; we need to recognize we cannot put a priority on education verbally and put it at the end of the pile when it comes to the budget and then come up with gimmicks to pay for it. 
   I ask the Senator to comment because we worked on this together for many years.

   Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, included within the Manager's amendment to the FY 2000 Interior Appropriations bill is a technical fix to last year's legislated I-90 Land Exchange. The amendment to the legislation was necessary to address to discovery of nesting marbled murrelets on two parcels of Forest Service land originally set to be exchanged to Plum Creek Timber Company. The language in the amendment is agreeable to both the Forest Service and Plum Creek. 
   Other issues, particularly that of potential landslides on parcels of land being transferred to Plum Creek near the town of Randle, Washington, have recently arisen. Members of the community are fearful that if some of these lands are harvested by Plum Creek that dangerous landslides are possible. I believe this a legitimate concern and have begun discussions with the Forest Service, Plum Creek, Congressman Baird and Senator Gorton as to possible solutions. I believe, however, that the land exchange is a benefit to the people of Washington and should proceed as we continue to work on the issue of concern to Randle residents.

   Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, we all want to solve the problems concerning implementation of the Northwest Forest Plan and the so-called ``survey and manage'' requirements. I have long supported and continue to support the plan and believe it should work as written. Unfortunately, section 329 undermines the important protection and scientific credibility of the forest plan and does not solve the current problems. That's why today I supported the Robb/Cleland amendment to strike section 329 from the fiscal year 2000 Interior appropriations bill. 
   Recently, a Federal court injunction halted dozens of timber sales in Washington, Oregon, and California. The injunction is not the fault of the timber industry, the environmental community, or the Northwest Forest Plan. The blame rests squarely on the forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management (BLM). They have failed to undertake the survey and manage requirements of the forest Plan despite having five years in which to do so. The Forest Service and BLM may believe they were meeting the requirements of the forest Plan, but clearly they did not. Unfortunately, the Forest Service and BLM's failure is harming innocent communities and, potentially, species. 
   The Northwest Forest Plan came out of a time of discorded in the Pacific Northwest. In 1992, our timber industry was shut down by the spotted owl. The Forest Plan was designed to provide industry with a greater assurance regarding timber harvest levels, while also protecting the forests and the species they support. 
   The Northwest Forest Plan's survey and manage provision was developed by scientists to help land mangers reduce the potential 9mpact of timber harvests and other activities on a wide variety of currently unlisted species, ranging from fungi, to mollusks, to tree voles. The result should have been a management program for the Pacific Northwest national forest that provided for stable timber harvest levels and protection against another spotted own crisis. That hasn't happened. 
   However, we cannot abandon the Northwest Forest Plan. We especially cannot abandon it without putting in place other ways to protect our forests species and provide a sustainable flow of timber. 
   Section 329, is not a solution to the failure of federal agencies to meet their survey and manage requirements. The solution lies in the forest Service and BLM getting their acts together and doing what they are required to do. If some of the survey and manage requirements are flawed or unnecessary, we need the Federal agencies and the scientific community to tell us. We can then all work to find a balanced solution. I commit to working with the industry, agencies, environmentalists, and my colleagues to find a way to make the Northwest Forest Plan work.

   Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I join my colleague in his remarks about the Plum Creek exchange. We worked very hard last year to enact this exchange. I also share a concern about the implications of the discovery or marbled  murrelets on the lands scheduled to be exchanged to Plum Creek. I agree these lands should be left in federal ownership. I would like to ask Senator GORTON does one senator understand legislation is needed to allow the Forest Service to keep the two sections in question?

   Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, today I am pleased to introduce on behalf of myself and the distinguished Senator from Hawaii, Mr. INOUYE, ``The Spokane Tribe of Indians of the Spokane Reservation Grand Coulee Dam Equitable Compensation Act.'' This bill will provide a settlement of the claims of the Spokane Tribe for its contribution to the production of hydropower by the Grand Coulee Dam. 
   The Grand Coulee Dam is the largest concrete dam in the world, the largest electricity producer in the United States, and the third largest electricity producer in the world. Grand Coulee is one mile in width; its spillway is twice the height of Niagara Falls. It provides electricity and water to one of the world's largest irrigation projects, the one million acre Columbia Basin Project. The Grand Coulee is the backbone of the Northwest's federal power grid and agricultural economy. 
   To the Spokane Tribe, however, the Grand Coulee Dam brought an end to a way of life. The dam flooded their reservation on two sides. The Spokane River changed from a free flowing waterway that supported plentiful salmon runs, to barren slack water that now erodes the southern lands of the reservation. The benefits that accrued to the nation and the Northwest were made possible by uncompensated injury to the Native Americans of the Columbia and Spokane Rivers. 
   The legislation I am introducing seeks to compensate the Spokane Tribe for its losses. In 1994, Congress enacted similar settlement legislation to compensate the neighboring Confederated Colville Tribes. That legislation provided a onetime payment of $53 million for past damages and approximately $15 million annually from the proceeds from the sale of hydropower by the Bonneville Power Administration. The Spokane Tribe settlement legislation would provide a settlement proportional to that provided to the Colville Tribes, which was based on the percentage of lands appropriated from the respective tribes for the dam. This translates into 39.4% of the past and future compensation awarded the Colville Tribes. 
   Let me give my colleagues some of the background surrounding this issue. From 1927 to 1931, at the direction of Congress, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers investigated the Columbia River and its tributaries. In its report to Congress, the Corps recommended the Grande Coulee site for hydroelectric development. In 1933, the Department of Interior federalized the project under the National Industrial Recovery Act, and in 1935, Congress authorized the project in the Rivers and Harbors Act. 
   In 1940, Congress enacted a statute to authorize the Interior Department to designate whichever Indian lands it deemed necessary for Grand Coulee construction and to receive all rights, title and 
   interest the Indians had in them. In return, the Tribes received compensation in the amount determined by Interior Department appraisals. However, the only land that was appraised and for which Tribes were compensated was the newly flooded land, for which the Spokane Tribe received $4700. There is no evidence that the Department advised or that Congress knew that the Tribes' water rights were not extinguished. Neither was there evidence the Department know the Indian title and trust status for the Tribal land underlying the river beds had not been extinguished. No compensation was included for the power value contributed by the use of the Tribal resources or for the loss of the Tribal fisheries or other damages to Tribal resources. 
   As pointed out in a 1976 Opinion of Lawrence Aschenbrenner, the Acting Associate Solicitor, Division of Indian Affairs, Department of Interior  
   The 1940 act followed seven years of construction during which farm lands, and timber lands were flooded, and a fishery destroyed, and during which Congress was silent as to the Indian interests affected by the construction. Both the Congress and the Department of Interior appeared to proceed with the Grand Coulee project as if there were no Indians involved there. ..... There is no tangible evidence, currently available, to indicate that the Department ever consulted with the Tribes during the 1993-1940 period concerning the ongoing destruction of their land and resources and proposed compensation therefore. ..... It is our conclusion that the location of the dams on tribal land and the use of the water for power production, without compensation, violated the government's fiduciary duty toward the Tribes.  
   In 1994, the Colville legislation settled the claims of the Colville Tribes to a share of the hydropower revenues from the Grand Coulee Dam. This claim was among the claims which the Colville Tribes filed with the Indian Claims Commission (ICC) under the Act of August 13, 1946, which included a five year statute of limitations. While the Colville Tribes had been formally organized for more than 15 years, the Spokane Tribe did not formally organize until 16 days prior to the ICC statute of limitations deadline. In addition, while the BIA was aware of the potential claims of the Spokane Tribe to a portion of the hydropower revenues generated by Grand Coulee, there is no evidence that the BIA ever advised the Tribe of such claims. The settlement for the Spokane Tribes was not included with that for the Colville Tribes in 1994 because the Colvilles had concerns that the statute of limitations would hold up the legislation. 
   Since the 1970s, Congress and federal agencies have indicated that both the Colville and Spokane Tribes should be compensated. Since 1994, when an agreement was reached to compensate the Colville Tribes, Congress and federal agencies have expressed interest in providing equitable compensation to the Spokane Tribe. This legislation will provide for the long overdue settlement to which the Spokane Tribe is entitled. I urge my colleagues to support this bill.

   Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I am pleased to bring before the Senate this conference report on the fiscal year 2000 military construction appropriations bill--the first of the 13 regular appropriations bills to be completed this year. 
   This is a good bill, leaner than we would wish but sufficient to meet the Services' most pressing military construction needs, particularly in terms of readiness and quality of life projects. The projects funded in this bill will give the men and women of our armed forces--and their families--a wide array of improved facilities in which to work, to train, and to live. 
   In my home state of Washington, for example, this bill provides nearly $129 million in funding for 16 different military construction projects plus $9 million for Army family housing at Fort Lewis. 
   Congress was faced with a difficult situation this year when the Pentagon, in a radical departure from regular procedure, requested incremental funding for the entire slate of fiscal year 2000 military construction projects. Thanks to the cooperation of Chairman STEVENS and Ranking Member BYRD, and to the efforts of Senator BURNS on the  Subcommittee, it didn't happen. What's more, we included language in our Committee report directing the Administration to fully fund all military construction requests in future budgets. 
   Unfortunately, this bill reflects a continued decline in the amount of money that is being allocated to military construction. This year's bill is funded at a level of $8.374 billion, which is $76 million less than the fiscal year 1999 bill. And this is at a time when funding for the Defense appropriations bill is heading toward a major increase. Military construction does not have the glamour of some of the gee whiz, high-tech items in the defense bill, but it is an integral part of readiness and quality of life in the military. If military construction is underfunded, we will wind up undercutting our nation's war fighting capability. We must not allow that to occur. 
   We will continue to fight the good fight for military construction dollars, ably led by our chairman, Senator BURNS, who is an extremely effective advocate for the needs of the military and a pleasure to work with on the Committee. I thank Senator BURNS, and Senators STEVENS and BYRD, for their unflagging support, and I also thank the Subcommittee staff for their hard work on this bill. 
   This is a good bipartisan conference report, and I urge my colleagues to accept it so that it can be sent to the President without delay and become the first fiscal year 2000 regular appropriations bills to be signed into law.

   Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise in support of the amendment offered by the Senator from New Mexico, Mr. BINGAMAN. This is a very important amendment that he has offered. Certainly, as we are talking about what the future of our country is going to be, we should be looking at what we are doing to invest in our young children today so they can be economically viable when they graduate from high school and college 15, 20 years from now, making sure that we have the money there for the Head Start Program, Pell grants, early childhood education. 
   These are important investments in our children, and if we follow through on a massive tax cut at this time, as the Senator from New Mexico has said, in the future we will not have the money to make sure that our kids get the kind of education they need to be viable members of our community. This is a very important amendment. 
   As we come to the end of this debate about what we are going to do to invest in our future, let's remember that if we put in place a tax cut such as this, we will harm our young children, we will harm Social Security and Medicare and critical programs for women in this country to make sure they don't live in poverty. We will not be able to pay off our debt, a very important issue that is facing us, which we have not left ourselves room for with a massive tax cut of this size. 
   Most critically, we will not be able to do what we have a responsibility to do, not only as Senators but as parents and as adults in this country, to make sure that those who follow us have the skills they need to make sure this country continues to run well in the future. Investment in Pell grants and in early childhood education, and investment in education, class size reduction, and training of our teachers will make a difference for the future. We have a responsibility to do that. 
   I thank the Senator from New Mexico for his work on education, and I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. 
   I thank the Chair. 
   Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.

   Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I join with the Senator from Florida in urging my colleagues to do the right thing. Our priorities are out of order. We must remember that we have all committed to saving Social Security and Medicare. These should be our priorities. We should be debating reforms  that save these essential income security programs instead of deciding how to squander a protected surplus that may never materialize. 
   This tax bill is a serious threat to women. By ignoring the looming crisis facing both Social Security and Medicare, we are jeopardizing the financial security of older women. If we fail to reform both Social Security and Medicare, we will force more older women into poverty. The progressive structure of both programs guarantees that for millions of older women, their golden years are not spent living far below the poverty level. 
   The bottom line is that Social Security and Medicare are women's issues. They are the most important domestic programs for women. By failing to allocate part of the projected surplus to saving these programs and instead acting for short term gratification, we place the issues important to women and families behind the special interests of DC lobbyists. 
   Why am I here today fighting for an amendment that simply says we will not squander the projected surplus until we have reformed Social Security and Medicare for the long term? Because I am here fighting for families and fighting for some economic peace of mind for older women. Without Social Security benefits, the elderly poverty rate among women would be 52.2 percent and among widows would be 60.6 percent. Instead 12 percent of all Social Security recipients live in poverty. While I still cannot accept even 12 percent, I do not want to be part of pushing more than 50 percent of older women into poverty. 
   Women are far more dependent on Social Security for their retirement income than are men. Three-quarters of unmarried and widowed elderly women rely on Social Security for more than half of their income. Fifty-eight percent of all Social Security recipients are women. Tell me women do not have a vital stake in this debate. 
   I am not saying we cannot have tax relief targeted to working families. We could have tax relief targeted to help more Americans save for retirement. However, we cannot jeopardize or gamble with the future economic security of millions of women. We have to tackle Social Security and Medicare reform first. 
   I know such reform will require heavy lifting. It will require us to invest potential surplus funds in the well-being of older Americans. I am committed to this reform. I am willing to sit down and tackle these tough assignments. What I am not willing to do is to watch my colleagues ignore the economic importance of both Social Security and Medicare for women. 
   A tax cut is not what most women are looking for. They want pay equity, economic opportunity, and retirement security. Women currently start out several economic steps behind men. We know that women today earn 74 cents for every dollar men earn. We know that women, on average, take a total of 11.5 years out of the work force to care for their families. We know that women often outlive their retirement savings. And, we know that more women live with chronic and disabling illnesses. This in part explains why women are more than twice as likely as men to live in poverty at age 65. 
   This amendment does not kill a tax cut. It will force us to make the tough decisions and to tackle the difficult job of reforming Social Security and Medicare. But, more important, it will provide greater economic security to women than any instant gratification tax cut ever would. Please do not force elderly women to pay the price for our misguided priorities.

   Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise today to express my concerns about the tax plan proposed by my Republican colleagues. 
   When I first came to the Senate in 1993, there were projected deficits as far as the eye could see. The United States had not seen a budget surplus in a quarter century. The American people were demanding change after more than a decade of Republicans in the White House, and Republicans in control of this body from 1980 to 1986. We knew we had to make some unpopular decisions to put our fiscal house in order. And working with the Clinton administration, the 103rd Congress made those tough decisions. 
   We reduced the tax burden for the middle class and we restored some degree of tax fairness to our system. We put the Federal Government on the road of less spending, while maintaining commitments to core priorities. Some of my colleagues were defeated in 1994 because they did the right thing for the future of America. 
   In 1997, Congress and the administration reached a bipartisan agreement to balance the budget and provide responsible tax relief to the American people. At that time, we had no idea we would achieve an on-budget surplus so quickly. Wise fiscal and monetary policies and a strong economy have provided a projected surplus that gives us hope we can solve some of the biggest challenges of our time. It is an exciting time to be in the Congress. 
   But in our excitement about the projected surplus, I am afraid we are acting in haste. And in doing so, we could undermine the hard work we have done to get to this point. 
   Let me be clear: I support responsible tax relief for the American people. 
   I support further reform of our nation's estate tax laws so that the small timberland owner in Mason County, Washington, and the small business owner who sells farm equipment in Moses Lake, Washington, can pass their land and livelihoods on to the next generation. 
   I support deductibility of health insurance costs so the self-employed owner of a technology start-up company in Seattle can afford health care. 
   I support reducing the so-called ``marriage penalty'' so that a young married couple in Spokane has more money to purchase their first home or begin saving for retirement. 
   I support expanding the low income housing tax credit so that we increase the availability of affordable housing for low- and middle-income families, especially in rural and urban areas. 
   I support the creation of Farm and Ranch Risk Management Accounts so the apple grower in the Yakima Valley will have one more tool to manage the risk inherent in agriculture. 
   I support the extension of the research and experimentation tax credit so Washington state high-tech and bio-tech companies have the incentive and the ability to invest in their long-term future and the future of our country. 
   I support reforming the individual alternative minimum tax so that families all across Washington state can continue to enjoy the full benefits of the HOPE scholarship and the per child tax credit that we passed in 1997. 
   In principle, I support all of these ideas, and many others that have been proposed. However, we cannot afford to make tax cuts without considering and carefully weighing the consequences. The American people deserve a responsible tax cut. They also deserve an honest debate from this Congress about how the Republican tax bill would affect their lives. 
   The majority's tax plan is based on an assumption. An assumption about what future Presidents and Congresses will do. They assume we will have a projected $964 billion non-Social Security surplus through fiscal year 2009. My colleagues propose to use $792 billion of that projected surplus over the next ten years to reduce taxes. They also assume that three-quarters of the projected surplus will come from unspecified reductions in spending by future Congresses. 
   To all the citizens watching around the country today, let me explain. The 1997 balanced budget agreement called for strict spending caps in discretionary, nondefense spending in fiscal years 2000, 2001, and 2002. In other words, the 17 percent of the Federal budget that funds all Government activities besides Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, and interest on the $5.5 trillion national debt is subject to cuts. That 17 percent funds the federal role in improving education, giving greater access to Head Start, preventing crime, protecting the environment, providing health care to veterans, investing in urban and rural communities, maintaining national parks, creating affordable housing, reducing traffic congestion through highways and mass transit, and many other important functions. 
   The projected surplus uses as its baseline spending targets established for fiscal year 2000. Right now, the Senate Appropriations Committee, of which I am a member, is struggling to move forward with bills. Even some of my Republican colleagues have indicated they cannot write appropriations bills within the current spending caps. For example, both the VA, HUD, and Independent Agencies spending bill and the Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education spending bill have not been reported by their respective subcommittee because of the funding difficulties involved. 
   The American people need to understand that this tax cut will mean 
   massive, unprecedented cuts in important and popular domestic priorities. 
   If we assume that Congress will meet the discretionary spending caps outlined in the Republican plan, then nondefense discretionary programs would have to be cut by 23 percent by 2009. 
   What does this mean for Washington state? 
   It means 23 percent less for Hanford cleanup. It means 23 percent less for salmon recovery. It means 23 percent less for community police officers. It means 23 percent less for highway improvements and mass transit to meet our growing infrastructure demands. It means 23 percent less for Head Start, which serves more than 9,000 children in Washington state. It means 23 percent less for reducing class size. it means 23 percent less for our VA hospitals. It means 23 percent less for the management of Mt. Rainer National Park. But reductions in discretionary spending is far from the only concern with this tax bill. 
   This bill jeopardizes our ability to reduce our national debt. All of my colleagues have worked hard to get our fiscal house in order. We have successfully balanced the budget, provided reasonable tax relief, and contributed to the strong economic environment we have today. One of our priorities must be continuing to reduce publicly held debt. By doing so we can decrease the interest payments on the debt that currently claim 15 percent of the federal budget. And reducing the debt will  also help keep our economy moving forward. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan has indicated again and again that reducing debt is preferable to a large tax cut. 
   I have saved the most important issue for last: Social Security and Medicare. Throughout the past year, as it appeared we would have a large projected budget surplus over the next ten years, I have said repeatedly that we should not raid the surplus for tax cuts until we protect Social Security and Medicare for the long term. 
   I have listened to many of my colleagues talk about the importance of returning money to taxpayers. Let me tell my colleagues there is no better return on the investment for taxpayers than saving Social Security and Medicare. This must be a top priority. If we fail to enact real reform, we will be judged harshly--and rightly so--by our children and grandchildren. Our Nation's future economic security rests in our hands. 
   Saving Social Security and Medicare is important to all of our Nation's seniors, but let me explain why it is especially critical to women and their families. Women are twice as likely as men to live with a chronic health care condition. Women receive Social Security and Medicare longer than men, and for all women over age 65, 60 percent of their retirement income comes from Social Security. Often, Social Security and Medicare are their only hope for maintaining a reasonable standard of living and some degree of independence and dignity. 
   If we fail to protect the solvency of both of these important safety net programs, my generation will become a burden on our children. Our grandchildren will not have the same economic opportunities that we had simply because their parents will be taking care of us. More and more older Americans would fail deep into poverty, further straining family and government resources, and most important the emotional and physical health of seniors. 
   My Republican colleagues claim they have created a lock box for Social Security and Medicare. However, the Republican proposal simply continues to reserve the Social Security trust fund surplus for Social Security. But, they do not provide any additional resources for either Social Security or Medicare and they do nothing to improve their solvency. Their lockbox is an empty promise. 
   We can argue about the economic threat posed by this package of tax cuts targeted to the more affluent and geared towards increased consumption, but I think we should be talking instead about maintaining the most successful economic stability programs ever implemented by the federal government--Social Security and Medicare. Can you imagine the economic upheaval that the insolvency of Social Security or Medicare would cause? I can assure my colleagues that hard working Americans want economic security in their retirement years, not tax breaks they may never even see or benefit from. 
   That's an important point, Mr. President. This tax bill, which would do nothing for Federal initiatives--from Social Security to Medicare, from transportation infrastructure to education, from Section 8 housing to clean air and water--that raise the quality of life of low and middle income Americans would then give three-fourths of the benefits in return to the top one-fifth of income earners. The average tax cut for the bottom 60 percent of taxpayers--with incomes of $38,200 and below--would be $139 per year. And in return for that tax cut, that same family will have to worry even more about taking care of elderly parents, about where they will find money to help their kids go to college since there are fewer Pell Grants, and about how they get to spend some time with their kids when they are on congested highways for hours each day. And to top it all off, when the family goes on vacation to see our nation's national parks, the gates will be closed. 
   I will support the alternative drafted by my Democratic friends on the Finance Committee. The alternative would meet many of our priorities for any tax bill we send to the President. 
   The Democratic alternative would provide broad-based relief to the more than 70 percent of taxpayers claiming the standard deduction. It would remove three million taxpayers from the tax rolls. It would also provide marriage penalty relief. These are real benefits targeted to precisely the lower and middle Americans that need it the most. 
   The Democratic alternative would allow 100 percent deductibility of health insurance costs for self-employed individuals and include a 30 percent tax credit for individuals without employer-sponsored plans. Since the Senate failed to pass a strong Patients' Bill of Rights, the least we can do is make health insurance more accessible to all Americans. 
   The Democratic alternative would make public school modernization a high priority. It would provide $24 billion in modernization bonds. Mr. President, this would send a strong message to students, parents and administrators that this Congress cares about providing the education infrastructure we desperately need. 
   The Democratic alternative would provide tax relief for our nation's struggling farmers and ranchers. It would establish Farm and Ranch Risk Management FARRM, accounts so that producers could better manage their income to reduce risk. Given that it is unlikely Congress will act to improve the long-term safety net for growers this year, FARRM accounts are the least we can do. 
   I urge my colleagues to vote for the Democratic alternative. A vote for the Democratic alternative is a vote for responsible tax relief and responsible government. At a time when most Americans do not have much faith in Congress, let us not compound that sentiment with responsible tax politics. We have worked so hard to correct the misguided policies of the past. As we move forward into the next century, let's learn the lessons of the past and reject the Republican tax plan in front of us.

   Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise to talk about some legislative language that is in the Interior bill, on which I will be offering an amendment shortly, which is going to give away more of our public lands for the benefit of a few and at a tremendous cost to all the rest of us. This is a cost to the American taxpayer and to our environment. 
   I want to begin, as I talk about this, by expressing that I am not going to be attacking the mining industry, which this amendment will be speaking to. I believe mining is an important industry in our country. 
   While most of us don't think about it a lot, mining does produce some important minerals that are vital in every one of our lives. Mining is not only important in individual routines, but it is vital to our industrial base and rural economies. We need an active mining industry in our country. Like all of my colleagues, I support a responsible mining act, but we, as citizens of this country, need a fair deal. 
   Today the mining industry is treated exceptionally well by our very old laws. Unfortunately, the American taxpayers are not treated well. They receive next to nothing from this industry, and our public lands suffer as well. 
   A fact that should both amaze and really appall the American public is that mining in this country is controlled by a law that was written in  1872. That law was written just a few short years after the Civil War, when Ulysses S. Grant was still President of the United States. The law of 1872 allows mining interests to buy our Federal lands for between $2.50 and $5 per acre. Guess what they are paying for that now, 130 years later. They are paying between $2.50 and $5 per acre. That is quite a bargain. 
   And what does the hard rock mining industry pay in royalties back to us for using our land, for what they pull out of our land? Nothing, zero, zilch. The hard rock mining industry is the only extractive industry in this country that pays absolutely no royalties to the taxpayers for minerals that are coming from our public lands. 
   In addition, over the course of these past 130 years since this law was written, the mining industry has caused tremendous environmental damage throughout the West. Mining waste dumps are responsible for poisoning streams, lakes, and ground water with toxic minerals such as lead, cadmium, and arsenic. Mining in the United States has left a legacy of 12,000 miles of polluted streams and 180,000 acres of polluted lakes. There are 500,000-plus abandoned mines in this country. Guess who pays for the cleanup. The taxpayers. That bill is estimated to be between $32 and $72 billion. We, the taxpayers, pay for the cleanup of these mines. 
   The 1872 mining law did make sense when it was written 130 years ago. I think everybody here agrees that a lot has changed in 130 years. Our Nation is very different. The value of our public lands has increased dramatically, far more than $2.50 an acre. We no longer need incentives to get people to move out west, which is why that mining law was written. The West, I think, has been settled. Our commitment in this country to protect the environment is now extremely intense. It was nonexistent 130 years ago when this law was written, in part because our natural resources seemed unlimited 130 years ago. I think all of us know that is not true anymore. 
   Mining technology has changed radically in 130 years. Today a lot more land is needed for every ounce of mineral that is extracted. When this law was written, an old man with a pony or a mule would ride up with his pickax and do his mining on his claim. Today we extract hundreds of pounds of rock that is waste. They use cyanide to leach through it to get just a tiny amount of gold. Technology has changed dramatically. 
   No one can stand up and say we should continue to regulate the mining industry under the law that was written 130 years ago. Everyone knows it is time to make changes. The question is how and when. Do we engage in a comprehensive overhaul, or do we do as we have done in this bill and just fix the section 
   of the 1872 law that offends the mining industry? Do we try to move forward with the 1872 mining law, or do we move backwards? 
   There is one provision in the 1872 mining law that provides minimal protection for the environment and for the taxpayers. When someone stakes a mining claim, the law provides that that person can obtain up to, but no more than, 5 acres of additional nonmineral land for the purpose of dumping mining waste. You would think, given the incredible deal that the mining industry is getting on access to public lands, the industry would be more than willing to comply with that provision. 
   Yet when the mining industry was faced with having to comply with the one and only environmental provision of the 1872 mining law, it went running to its champions in Congress to change that provision. The mining industry says it cannot mine if it is only given 5 acres of public land on which to dump its waste. Indeed, it argues, and Senator CRAIG's amendment in this Interior appropriation bill guarantees, the mining industry should get as much public land as it desires to dump its waste. The contention of the industry as well as the language in this bill is that the 5-acre limitation in the 1872 mining law is without meaning. They are wrong. The 5-acre provision provides a small amount of protection for our public lands, and this Senate should retain it. 
   The Senate has already done some work on this issue. Senator GORTON amended the emergency supplemental appropriations bill that we passed a few months ago to exclude a mine in my home State of Washington from this 5-acre mill site limitation. Of course, other mining industries now want the same good deal. So Senator CRAIG put a rider on the Interior appropriations bill we are now considering, in full committee, that completely voids any limitation on mill sites for all current and future mining operations. 
   We have to ask: Where is the balance? Where is the fairness in this limited approach? Where is the fix for the public and their lands to this outdated mining law? It is absolutely absent. The sort of reform to the 1872 mining law that we are witnessing in this bill is not taking us forward but it is taking us backwards. 
   The environmental provisions in the mining law should be strengthened, not eliminated. Taxpayers should be compensated much more by the mining industry rather than being asked to expand the giveaway of public lands that we are doing in this bill. 
   Senator GORTON's amendment on the supplemental appropriations bill and Senator CRAIG's amendment on the Interior bill give the mining industry everything it wants and give the American public larger dumps. Companies that paid next to nothing for the public land they are mining, $2.50 an acre, are still paying absolutely no royalties and dumping more waste rock than ever on our precious public lands. 
   I am not going to stand by and let this industry dump waste rock on our public lands without limitation and without true compensation. We do need comprehensive mining law reform, but until then I am going to fight this effort to piecemeal reform, especially piecemeal reform that benefits the one side that already enjoys tremendous advantages under the current system. 
   Let me show Senators a photo of Buckhorn Mountain in Washington State. This is the area in Washington State. It is a gorgeous piece of public land, our land. This is what it will look like once a mill moves forward, from this to this. What does it cost the mining industry to go from this to this? Mr. President, $2.50 an acre. They won't have to pay for the extra land to dump their rock, the cyanide-leached rock that they put there. They won't pay the taxpayers anything, and this is our public land. We know we need a mining industry, but if the mining industry wants to continue to make profits in this country, then they should at least compensate the public for what they are going to do. 
   Let me show my colleagues what this area will look like in a few years. What will the mining industry pay us for changing it from the beautiful photo I showed to this? Just $2.50 an acre. Under this bill and under the bill that passed recently, they are going to get as much acreage as they want to dump their rocks onto our public lands. 
   I want to make some points that I think are worth remembering. The mining industry has been very slow to embrace any mining law reform. Now that it has encountered a part of the law it doesn't like, it is trying to eliminate the one provision that can limit some of the damage that has been caused by the mining. 
   The mining law permits mining companies to extract gold, silver, copper, and other hard rock minerals without paying a cent in royalties to the taxpayer. Hard rock mining is the only extractive industry to get this benefit. I will show this to my colleagues. Coal pays 8-percent royalties for underground mining. Hard rock mining, none; they pay nothing. 
   As we look at this chart, we see that hard rock mining clearly has been given a great gift by the taxpayers of this country, and now in this bill, we see them wanting more and more public lands. Have they negotiated a change to the 1872 mining law in exchange for the more land on which they want to dump? No. They are not going to be paying any more royalties. They are not going to be paying any more for the land. We have simply given it away to all current and future mines in this bill. 
   Coal, oil, and gas miners all pay 12.5-percent royalties from what they take from public lands. Since 1872, taxpayers have given away $240 billion worth of minerals to the hard rock mining industry. By contrast, all Western States collect a royalty or production fee for minerals removed from State lands. We are talking Federal lands in this bill.  Western States collect a royalty or production fee on State lands, collecting between 2 and 10 percent on the gross income of mineral production. We collect nothing for Federal lands. 
   The 1872 mining law is in need of environmental and fiscal reform. Congress should not overturn the mill site decision and expand it to allow more dumping of mining waste on public lands without getting something back. The mill site decision does not halt hard rock mining on public lands. I want to make that clear. The mill site decision does not halt hard rock mining. Don't believe the false rhetoric you will hear about the Solicitor's opinion enforcing a provision of the 1872 mining law, at the expense of millions of dollars and thousands of jobs. That is simply not true. They can pay for it as everybody else does if they need more land. 
   The Department of the Interior will not enforce the mill site waste limitation retroactively. For future mine proposals and mine expansion, the limitation will apply. The industry says the mill site decision is not consistent with existing law and instead is policy advocacy by the Interior Department. I am sure we will hear that from our colleagues. That is incorrect. The 1872 mining law clearly limits mill site claims to 5 acres for each lode or placer claim. If the industry is so sure of its legal position, it can fight the Solicitor's opinion in court. 
   For the Record, let me show my colleagues what the law actually says. The mill site statute we referred to throughout this debate is right here. It says:  
   Where nonmineral land not contiguous to the vein or lode is used or occupied by the proprietor of such vein or lode for mining or milling purposes, such nonadjacent surface ground may be embraced and included in an application for a patent for such vein or lode, and the same may be patented therewith.  
   And it goes on and it says: 
   Such land may be included in application for a patent for such claim, and may be patented therewith subject to the same requirements as to survey and notice as are applicable to placers. No location made of such nonmineral land shall exceed five acres.  
   That was the law written back in 1872. It is very clear. Five acres. It says so right here. If the industry doesn't agree with the Solicitor's opinion that this law doesn't say exactly what we have just read, they can go to court and fight it. But to come and give this huge giveaway to an industry that already receives an awful lot from the taxpayers I believe is wrong. 
   Clearly, we need to reform the mining law of 1872 and maybe, in fact, the mill site limitation needs revision, but not here, not in this way. We need to hold hearings and mark up an authorization bill. We ought to give the American public time to learn of the issue and revise input. If we are going to revise the 1872 law--and we should--we, the taxpayers, ought to give something back.

   Mrs. MURRAY. The Senator from Illinois is correct. The technology that is available today allows mining companies to haul out rock, pour cyanide through it, and come up with an ounce of gold. The price of gold today allows them to do that. It has been profitable for them. Therefore, they take tons of rock, and they are claiming of course that they need more acreage for mill sites because it takes so much more rock to get a small amount of gold.

   Mrs. MURRAY. I respond to the Senator from Illinois, I am as baffled as he is, that every Senator knows the 1872 mining law needs to be reformed. It needs to be reformed in a fair and responsible manner. If, indeed, the mining companies need more mill sites, then the taxpayers ought to get something in return. In fact, the mill site limitation is truly the only part of this law that allows us some control over what is left behind because the mining industry did not want to give and take, they just took, and got their rider put into this bill.

   Mrs. MURRAY. If the Senator will yield, I have a chart that shows what you do if you are going to mine coal and what 
   you do if you are going to mine hard rock. On the selection of the coal mining site, you have to get approval through a leasing process under the Mineral Leasing Act. In comparison, if you are going to do hard rock mining, which we are talking about in this bill, it is self-initiation on the location. In the mining law based in 1872, there is no BLM approval that is required.

   I would think the Senators from States who have coal miners who are paying 8 percent would be rushing to the floor and saying: Where is the fairness here where you can mine hard rock for gold and pay not one dime back to the taxpayers for the use of that public land and for what you have extracted from that public land, and yet coal is 12 1/2 percent?

Maybe we should negotiate that in terms of royalties; maybe it should be in a higher percentage that they pay the public; maybe it should be in the requirement that they clean up the land that they have left behind. 
   Certainly we should get something back for our public lands rather than what we have done in this bill, which is to just give them more of our land.

Instead of negotiating with Congress to pay something back for additional shares, they are saying, no, in this provision in this bill, we have given it away to them for nothing else.

We should not give it away in the bill. That is what we have done.

   Mrs. MURRAY. I appreciate the comments from the Senator from California. There are mines in her State as well as many other States where this amendment will simply allow acres and acres of mill site waste to be dumped, with nothing back to the taxpayers. 
   I hope my colleagues will support me when I offer the amendment to strike the language in this bill, and I hope, as a Congress, we do what we should have done so long ago, which is to look at the 1872 mining law. If the mining companies, indeed, do need more dump sites, ask what we get in return. We should have a fair debate on the mining law. It should not just be in this Interior bill which comes to us at 5 o'clock, when we need to pass a tax bill that we want to start on tomorrow and everybody wants to finish tomorrow, forcing a bill to pass with a huge giveaway. Let's give something back, make sure we have responsible mining reform, and make sure we do it right for the taxpayers who deserve a lot better. 
   I appreciate the questions from the Senator from California. I will be offering my amendment in a short while. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment on behalf of the environment, on behalf of the taxpayers, on behalf of what is right and fair for people who pay their taxes every day, for other industries to pay their royalties, to pay a fair share. Let's do the mining reform law correctly. 
   I thank my colleagues. I know the Senator from Illinois wants to discuss this, and I see the Senator from Nevada.

   Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, we are coming to the end of this debate. 
   Obviously, there will be a tabling motion on my amendment. We have heard a lot on both sides. The one thing we all share is the understanding that the mining industry is an important industry in this country. We understand it provides jobs in many of our communities. We want to make sure that is retained in a fair way. The mining industry did not like the position of the mining law. Instead of allowing reform of a law that was written almost 130 years ago in a give-and-take fashion, they have come sweeping into the Interior bill, and in that bill the proponents have changed that portion of the law that the mining industry does not like. 
   Maybe that portion of the law needs to be changed because of current technology that is out there. However, they should give something back. They already have an incredible deal. They pay $2.50 to $5 an acre for the land they use. They pay no royalties and now in this Interior bill they are allowed incredible mass use of our public lands. 
   We have heard a lot about the law and the BLM manual. Let me show Members what the statute says. This is the 1872 law. It is very clear. It says:  
   Such nonadjacent surface ground may be embraced and included in at application for patent for such vein or lode, and the same may be patented therewith ..... on no location made on or after May 10, 1872, of such nonadjacent land shall exceed five 
   acres. 
   And for placer claims:  
   Such land may be included in an application for a patent for such claim and may be patented therewith subject to the same requirements as to survey and notice as are applicable to the placers. No location made of such nonmineral land shall exceed five acres.  
   The law is clear. The BLM manual from 1976 to 1991 was also very clear and talked about 5 acres. This was changed in 1991 at the end of the Bush era. It was changed to read:  
   A mill site cannot exceed five acres in size. There is no limit to the number of mill sites that can be held by a single claimant.  
   We are not here to debate the BLM manual. We are here to say: Should the law that was written in 1872 be changed to favor one side of this debate in this Interior bill before the Senate right now? We are saying if we are going to change a part of the law, this law, then we should ask the industry what they will give us in return. Will it be royalty that other industries have to pay? Is it more per acre? Should environmental law apply? Should they clean it up? 
   We should debate it. It should be part of the 1872 Mining Act reform. I think this Congress ought to get into this debate. To do it blatantly for one side in this bill, this night, is not the way to do it. That is why we are debating this issue. I hope many of our colleagues will understand this is a giveaway to an industry that does not pay royalties, that only pays between $2.50 and $5 an acre, less than any Member would pay to go camping on our public lands. 
   I think it needs to be done in a fair way. I urge my colleagues to step back. What are we doing for the taxpayers of this country? Let's be fair to them. Let's be fair to our public lands. Let's be fair to the law and do it right and not do it in a rider on the Interior appropriations bill. I urge my colleagues to vote against the motion to table. 
   I thank all of our colleagues who came to the floor to help with this debate.

   Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the amendment to protect Americans from hate crimes. It is unfortunate that the amendment's chief sponsor, Senator TED KENNEDY, couldn't be here to take part in this debate. Senator KENNEDY has worked tirelessly to enact this crucial piece of legislation. He has my heartfelt appreciation for his work on this and my sympathy for the loss of his nephew. I can't possibly match his passion and eloquence on this issue, but I am here today to discuss and support his amendment on hate crimes prevention. 
   Hate crime is real. Despite great gains in equality and civil rights over the later part of this century, hate crimes are still being committed. Those who commit these heinous crimes must be punished. 
   We all remember Matthew Shepard. He was a young man who just last fall was viciously struck down in the prime of his life. Tragically, he is now a reminder of what happens when he do not stand up to hate and bigotry. We must treat hate crimes as the deadly threat they are and do more to prevent them. These are not simply assaults. They are violent crimes motivated by hate and bigotry. 
   Passing this amendment gives us more tools to fight hate. I am pleased to join with many of my colleagues as a co-sponsor of this important legislation. The amendment would expand the definition of a hate crime and improve prosecution of those who act out their hate with violence. If someone harms another because of the victim's race, gender, color, religion, disability or sexual orientation, they will be punished. No longer will the activity of the victim matter, but the actions and motivations of the perpetrator will be the focus. It is important to note that the prosecutor would still have to convince a jury beyond a reasonable doubt that the criminal act was motivated by prejudice. 
   No one can beat a person to death and leave them to die without being  motivated by a deep sense of hate. In the case of Matthew Shepard, it was no simply robbery. The motive was hate. 
   I know some of my colleagues argue that the states are doing an adequate job of handling hate crimes on their own. I commend them for their efforts, but I believe the federal government has a further role in this as well. We already prosecute at the federal level many crimes that are motivated by prejudice. We need to strengthen these federal hate crimes laws and increase the role of the federal government in ending this violence. It wasn't that many years ago that we stood up for equality and justice by forcing the states and private citizens to end segregation and discrimination. Now we must do the same for hate crimes against any of our citizens.

   Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, my amendment will provide the Pacific coastal tribes of Washington, Oregon, and California with salmon recovery funding. 
   I would like to start by expressing my deep appreciation to Subcommittee Chairman GREGG and subcommittee ranking member, Senator HOLLLINGS, for including in the Commerce, Justice, State appropriations bill, $80 million for the Pacific coastal salmon recovery account. Given the fiscal constraints I am pleased the money was made available. 
   The Pacific coastal salmon initiative was proposed by the Administration to help address the rash of endangered species listings of salmon along the coast. The Administration's initiative called for the funding of $100 million with up to 10% of that money going to the Pacific coastal tribes. Another portion of the initiative called for increased personnel for the National Marine Fisheries Service in order to handle a higher workload brought about by new ESA listings around the nation. The NMFS received some funding in the bill to undertake this initial work. 
   The only party to this initiative that did not receive funding was the tribes. I do not know why this decision was made, but I believe it sends the wrong message and we must remedy the situation. My amendment directs funds to Pacific coastal tribes to participate in the salmon recovery process. We need them to make this process work. 
   I would like to recognize that my amendment to ensure tribal participation is cosponsored by Senators INOUYE, BOXER, FEINSTEIN, and WYDEN. I would also like to recognize the support of Governor Gary Locke of Washington and Governor John Kitzhaber of Oregon. Lastly, I appreciate the support of King County Executive Ron Sims, Pierce County Executive Doug Sutherland, and Snohomish County Executive Bob Drewel. 
   The reason all these people are supporting this amendment is that they know the tribes are a vital partner in the coordinated effort to recover salmon. Successful recovery is going to require all parties working as a team. Leaving the tribes out of the equation is not a way to build the team. 
   Some may suggest that my amendment is unnecessary because the tribes can apply to the states for a portion of the money being provided to the states. However, tribes should not have to receive these funds through a state grant process or via any other mechanism that might diminish their roles as sovereign governments. It is Congress that can do the right thing at this stage to respect the rights of the Tribes to be self-governing and join their counterpart governments in this vital partnership. 
   I appreciate the cooperation of the Chairman and my colleagues in agreeing to the adoption of my amendment to make the Pacific coastal tribes true partners in our effort to recover threatened and endangered salmon runs.

   Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a resolution that has passed the Senate now for 3 years unanimously. 
   My resolution, which I am submitting today, along with Senator WARNER and 28 other original cosponsors, establishes October 21, 1999, as a day of national concern about young people and gun violence. For the last several years, I have sponsored this legislation. This year, Senator WARNER has joined me in leading the cosponsorship drive as we pledge to our young people across the Nation that we support their strong efforts to help stop the violence in their own schools and communities. I thank Senator WARNER for his help and partnership in work on this issue. 
   Sadly, this resolution has special meaning for all of us after the tragic events that occurred earlier this year in Littleton, CO, and Conyers, GA. These school shootings across the Nation have paralyzed their communities and shocked the country. In recent years, we have seen similar shootings from Mississippi to Oregon. These events have touched us all. Adults and young people alike have been horrified by the violence that has occurred in our schools, which should be a safe haven for children. We are all left wondering what we can do to prevent these tragedies. 
   I am again introducing this resolution because I am convinced the best way to prevent gun violence is by reaching out to individual children and helping them make the right decisions. This resolution simply establishes a special day that gives parents and teachers, government leaders, service clubs, police departments, and others a way to focus on the problems caused by gun violence. It also empowers young people to take affirmative steps to end this violence by encouraging them to take a pledge not to use guns to resolve disputes.

   Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise to join my colleagues in opposition to the Smith resolution on normal trade relations for China. Once again, the Senator is confronted with an effort to circumvent the legislative process and radically change U.S. policy towards China. I oppose this effort. But I also caution my Senate colleagues, that the approach advocated here today is very dangerous to U.S. foreign policy. 
   United States-China relations are at a very delicate stage now. The relationship is very troubled at the moment. The accidental U.S. bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade and accusations of Chinese nuclear espionage have given policymakers in both countries numerous reasons to be cautious about this important relationship. 
   Today's debate will be a brief one. With my time, I want to make a couple of points to articulate why we must once again defeat the effort to deny NTR or MFN status to China. 
   First, trade is the foundation of the United States-China relationship. Certainly, there are problems on the trade front. We have a troubling deficit, problems with issues like transshipment and intellectual property rights violations, and market access issues--to name just a few. Many of these issues are under consideration in the talks led by the United States over China's accession to the World Trade Organization. I continue to support China's accession to the WTO on commercially viable terms. I think we are very close to a WTO agreement that will be strongly supported by the Congress. 
   Yes, trade with China is very important. But, perhaps more important, is the fact that trade has opened China's doors to the world. Our government is able to engage China on a number of issues from drug smuggling to cooperation on issues like human rights, North Korea, nuclear expansion in South Asia, and global environmental problems. Like it or not, if we end our trade relationship with China as some suggest, all of these beneficial openings to China will be curtailed or lost. 
   It is not just government-to-government contacts that we should be worried about. My personal opinion is the American people are having a far greater impact on the Chinese people than any congressional debate could ever have. Students and scholars, adoptive parents, business and tourist delegations, sister city delegations, and local government officials from my state are actively engaged in China. These folks are making a difference that benefits both the American and Chinese people. I do not want to see these people-driven initiatives for change jeopardized by passage of this resolution. 
   One in five people in Earth live in China. It is an immense population that impacts Us all in so many ways--the world's food supply, pollution problems, and the use of natural resources, to name a few. 
   The United States has the ability to cooperatively assist in China's development; we must not shy from this opportunity to aid both the Chinese and American people. 
   My second point addresses reform in China. Within China today a furious debate is raging. Leaders like President Jiang Zemin and Premier Zhu Rhongi are under attack by more conservative anti-Western forces. The Embassy bombing and other issues have emboldened the hard line forces within China's leadership. There are elements within the Chinese Government that do not want to move forward with constructive ties with the United States. 
   The resolution before the Senate today, in my estimation, sends a very dangerous message to China. The message is the United States is recoiling towards a more confrontational posture towards China. Passage of this resolution will strengthen those in China who argue that China should treat the United States as an adversary. If that happens, the relationship will certainly spiral in dangerous directions for both the Chinese and American people. 
   If we undermine the reform forces in China, it will have dangerous implications for this country. At the United  Nations, where China is a permanent member of the Security Council, the United States will have a very difficult time as the world's lone superpower. In Asia, where economic recovery is beginning to take place and where we have 100,000 military personnel, our efforts to preserve decades of peace will be jeopardized. And, the United States will be alone in the world in seeking to isolate China economically, potentially causing problems with our allies in Europe and Asia. 
   Though I strongly oppose this resolution, I do not mean to imply that the China relationship is easy or that the United States should make concessions to the Chinese. That is simply not the case. The United States-China relationship is very difficult for this country and will be so for some time. I have many objections to Chinese actions. But, I believe, to change China, we must be an aggressive participant in the global effort to engage the Chinese Government and the Chinese people. 
   This resolution before us today would seriously threaten our ability to contribute to change in China. And that is clearly not in our national interest. I urge my colleagues to defeat the Smith resolution.

    Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize a class of students from Tahoma High School in Maple Valley, Washington who are the champions of the Region One--Western States award of the ``We the People ..... the Citizen and the Constitution'' national finals. This outstanding group  earned the highest cumulative score in their geographic region during the first two days of the ``Citizen and the Constitution'' national finals, competing against 50 other classes from across the country. Their remarkable understanding and appreciation of the fundamental ideals and values of American constitutional government assure me that this emerging generation will contribute much to the future of civic life. 
   These Tahoma High School students serve as role models to their peers, not only by expressing their views and arguments in a poised and mature manner, but also by expressing them as they relate to government. I commend these students on beginning this important civic dialogue at an early age, and sincerely hope that they make it a life-long commitment. The honored students, led by Mark Oglesby, are: Adam Baldridge, Mary Basinger, Josh Bodily, Sydney Brumbach, Katie Carder, Erica Chavez, Elizabeth Dauenhauer, Steven Dekoker, Meaghan Denney, Nathan Dill, Marisa Dorazio, Jesse Duncan, Jayson Hart, Jon Hellstom, Carolyn Hott, Daniel Lindner, Casey Lineberger, Clark Lundberg, Karrie Pilgrim, Michael Pirog, David Rosales, Jason Shinn, Jeremy Sloan, Justin Sly, Donny Trieu, Orianna Tucker, Jessica Walker, Raymond Williams, and Elizabeth Zaleski.

   Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, as we prepare for final passage of the Republican HMO legislation, I come to the Senate floor to express my disappointment and my frustration with this end product. This bill is a failure and ultimately we will all suffer the consequences of the majority's reluctance to protect patients. 
   I had high hopes at the beginning of the week that we could come together on some of the key areas of agreement and produce a good bipartisan bill to protect patients. I had hoped for a bill to put the health care decisions back into the hands of patients and consumers. 
   Our health care system is in a state of flux. It has moved from a system that served people only when they got sick and encouraged overutilization. Now we have a system where economic barriers are erected to prevent patients from accessing care. We have gone from a system of waste and over-utilization to a system where patients cannot get the care for which they paid. Decisionmaking--life and death decisionmaking--is now too often solely in the hands of insurance executives focused on profits and quarterly reports. Who is looking out for the patients? 
   We need to restore a balance with a system where insurance protects you when you become ill, but also helps prevent you from becoming sick in the first place. We need a system where the ultimate decision rests in the hands of patients based on the medical advice of their physicians. We need a system where people are fighting illness, not fighting the insurance company. We need a system where doctors are not spending 45 minutes on the phone with an insurance company so a sick child can be admitted to a hospital. We need a system where parents are free to stop at the first, closest emergency room and not drive to the one their insurer commands if their child has been hit by a car. 
   I know such a system does and can exit. One of my greatest concerns is what the failure of Patients' Bill of Rights means to managed, coordinated care. Let me tell my colleagues, I support managed care. I support a coordinated care approach that is focused on prevention and early detection of disease. 
   HMOs and managed care were born in my state of Washington. The original HMO law, signed by a Republican President in the early 1970's was enacted because of the new, revolutionary form of health insurance still in its infancy in Washington state. I want to be clear, health maintenance organizations are not the enemy. One of my colleagues yesterday made a statement that the Democrats saw HMOs as the bad guys. He tried to make a point that some 
   how supporting the Health Security Act in 1994 and the Patients' Bill of Rights was contradictory. He was wrong. Our intent is to ensure patients the right to receive the care they have paid for, not to eliminate coordinated care. 
   The experience in Washington state has taught me that we can have a system that reduces overutilization and unnecessary care while actually improving health care benefits. I know that good managed care structure has increased our immunization rates. I know that it has contributed to the fact that almost 70 percent of women in Washington state over the age of 55  receive mammagrams. I know that a good managed care structure has increased our average life expectancy and reduced our infant mortality. It has reduced the number of people who smoke and decreased the incidence of heart disease. We have a healthier population in Washington state, in part because we have the benefits of a coordinated care delivery system that focuses on prevention and reduces wasteful, unnecessary health care services. 
   Unfortunately, things are changing in Washington. Due to mergers and acquisitions we now have health care plans being run by companies in California and other states. We now have for-profit insurance companies using HMOs and more importantly, we have premiums from HMO participants going to enhance short term profits. Our once envied system has deteriorated. I am hearing more and more from patients and physicians about the obstacles they must over-come to access health care. They must push hard to get wise health care decisions, not just big economic benefits. 
   I honestly believe that if we fail to restore some kind of balance, managed care will become a thing of the past. People will demand changes and will dismantle managed care. We will then be back to a system where only the very wealthy have regular and consistent access to quality health care and where you only see your doctor when you are ill, not to prevent illness. 
   I had hoped that a uniformed standard set of protections for patients would restore some trust to managed care. That is the only way we can ensure that the ``outrage of the day'' does not become the guiding force in state legislatures. If my colleagues think that by killing our balanced and fair Patients' Bill of Rights it will end this debate, think again. You can be sure that in the next session of the legislature in each state there will be new patient protection bills ranging from access to expanded, mandated benefits. Patients will demand this. 
   Ultimately, these single ``outrage of the day'' bills will be the nail in the coffin for managed, coordinated care. We will see the end of a health care delivery system that encourages prevention and keeps people healthier, longer. We will see a return to a system where access is only provided to the ill. 
   Not only does this jeopardize health insurance, it jeopardizes biomedical research and development. Why invest in research that prevents illness or prevents hospital stays or detects cancer sooner, when no one will have access to it? Why double NIH research dollars, to prevent illness and to find cures for deadly diseases like cancer and MS, if patients are not encouraged to 
   seek care to prevent illness or to seek regular, prevention and early detection care? Doesn't it seem to be a contradiction to encourage biomedical research when we do not have a health care delivery system that invests in wellness? 
   Our Patients' Bill of Rights will not result in pushing people off of insurance. Our bill is a reasonable, cost effective proposal that does enhance managed care, not diminish it. It rewards those insurance companies that do offer a good package and a good product. They will no longer have to compete with companies that do not look at their beneficiaries as people, but rather premiums. There are good insurance companies out there. I know this to be true as there are several in Washington state. While I have heard of some problems in the state, I believe it is a combination of consumer misinformation and distrust. But, unfortunately these good companies have to compete in a very price sensitive market with companies that have policies in place to limit and deny access to quality care. 
   I am also disappointed that most of my Republican colleagues refused to engage in an open and honest debate. They offered amendments sold as access to emergency room coverage or improvements in women's health or access to clinical trials, when in fact their underlying bill is nothing more than a simple statement only saying we support patients, but not supporting and enforcing access to care. My Republican colleagues say they want these things, and as participants in the Federal Employees Health Benefit Plan we have these benefits and protections, but they do not provide them to all insured Americans because the insurance lobby has told them to say no. 
   This is a short sighted strategy as parents with sick children, cancer survivors, patients with MS or Parkinsons, and women denied access to ob/gyn care will ultimately be heard. Wait until they discover that for $2 more a month they cold have gone to the ER or they could have participated in a new life saving clinical trial at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center. They could have gone to see their ob/gyn when they first found the lump on their breast or their child could have seen a pediatric oncologist following a diagnosis of cancer. What do my colleagues think will happen when families realize that for the price of a Happy Meal each month they could have saved their child? There will be outrage and it will be heard all the way to Washington, DC. 
   I hope that this issue is not dead. I hope some how this is not the end of the debate and that like so many other issues we will be able to put aside partisan differences and work towards real patient protections.

   Mrs. MURRAY. Thank you, Mr. President. 
   I thank my colleagues who have been on the floor talking about an issue this morning that I think is becoming more and more critical, and that is access to clinical trials, the amendment by Senator DODD. 
   It seems to me that in the Senate we have talked, in a bipartisan way, about making sure we have increased funding for NIH so we can have access to the best new research for diseases such as cancer, diabetes, and multiple sclerosis. 
   A lot of great research is occurring right now at NIH. Members have said many times that needs to be increased. In fact, the Labor Committee has worked very hard, and I am very proud of the fact we have increased funding to NIH by almost 40 percent. 
   However, today, citizens, taxpayers, who are paying the dollars for that increased research at NIH, are being routinely denied access to that new research when their HMO says they will not pay for a new clinical trial--these are new medications, new medical devices that have 
   been researched and we have paid for the research through our own taxpayer dollars. 
   But when it comes to our constituents, who have paid for this research, having access to the clinical trials, having access to this new research, they are not allowed because their HMO denies it. That is why I think this amendment is so important to the taxpayers of this country. 
   I met recently with a number of cancer survivors in my own home State of Washington. Some of them were patients at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center, a very well known cancer research facility, one of the premiere centers in this country. The doctors and the patients told me about how they were routinely being denied access to these clinical trials--these people who have no other recourse, who may have MS or cancer or another severe illness, who have no other hope out there except for access to a clinical trial. It is their last chance at life and their doctors recommended it. The doctors at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center said: This is their chance at life, and their insurance company, their HMO, said: No, sorry; we're not going to pay for it. 
   One of the things the doctors said, which made an impression on me, was that a patient was going to receive some kind of care with some kind of cost that their insurance company was going to have to pay for, and, in fact, the clinical trials, for the most part,  cost less than the treatment this person was going to have. So they did not understand why the insurance company was going to decide which treatment they were going to have. They felt very strongly the doctors ought to be the ones deciding what kind of medical treatment this patient should be having. And the clinical trials were their best chance at recovery and hope for life. 
   I hope the Members of the Senate will agree with Senator DODD and the other sponsors of this amendment and allow people to have access to the research they have paid for by taxpayers when they need it, when they are victims of cancer, when they have MS, when they have diabetes, and allow them to have access to clinical trials. 
   We will all win in the end because, without these clinical trials, we will not have the research we need to make sure these kinds of medical devices or these prescription drugs are then available to the general public as routine care that is paid for by HMOs. 
   I commend my colleagues for their debate on this issue. I urge all of us who have said we are for increased funding at NIH and increased funding for research to now allow our constituents in this country access to that care. 
   I thank the Senator.

   Mrs. MURRAY. In response to the Senator from Massachusetts, the doctors at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center are very concerned about their patients who are being denied access to medical care because they say these trials are what will not only help patients but will help them give the best care to all of 
   their patients. They are not able to do the job we expect them to do any longer, not because of medical decisions they make but because of the decisions made by HMOs.

Not only will it hurt the health of the woman who has been denied access to the clinical trial who has ovarian cancer or breast cancer, but it also denies us, all the rest of us, access to good health care because we will never know whether or not that clinical trial works, which could then be available to the rest of us.

   Mrs. MURRAY. If the Senator will further yield, I understand that the Senator is a surgeon and has seen clinical trials and knows the benefit of them. I listened with respect to his arguments. 
   But in this amendment, we are simply assuring that the patients will get the best care. And if the best care for their particular condition is a clinical trial that will not only benefit themselves but the rest of the people with that condition as well--and NIH has paid for the vast majority of this. I understand from CBO that 90 percent of insurance companies have been paying for clinical trials. The amendment ensures that won't go away. We are seeing more and more HMOs look at their bottom line and that benefit is being taken away. We want to make sure the insurance companies continue to pay their part. Certainly, a patient who goes in cannot afford to pay for that clinical trial, but they have been paying premiums for years. Shouldn't that be part of what they expect when they pay a premium to an HMO?

   Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I have a great deal of admiration for the Senator from Maine, Ms. SNOWE, who, in my time with her over the last several years in the Senate, has worked long and hard on behalf of women's health issues. I appreciate she is offering an amendment that we offered yesterday on this side which deals with the issue of drive-through mastectomies. The language is very similar to the language offered by Senator ROBB from Virginia, along with myself, Senator MIKULSKI, Senator BOXER, Senator LANDRIEU, and Senator LINCOLN. It was defeated on a 52-to-48 vote yesterday. 
   We would have been delighted to work with our colleagues if they wanted to talk with us about a word or two about which they were concerned. We were not given that opportunity. The amendment was simply defeated. 
   We stand very strong on this side that we need to make changes in the health care delivery system in this country so that the woman from the State of Washington the Senator from Maine talked about is not sent home after a radical surgery, a mastectomy,  to care for herself when she is unable to do so. The doctor and the woman should make the decision based on the best medical judgment, not based on the bottom line from an HMO. I agree entirely with the Senator from Maine. 
   Unfortunately, because it is offered in this way, what this amendment does is it gives us a Hobson's choice regarding women who have had a mastectomy because this amendment wipes out the amendment by Senator DODD on clinical trials that we have debated for the last several hours on this floor, where we have talked about the need for women with breast cancer or ovarian cancer, or the gentleman with multiple sclerosis or the man with heart disease, or the young child with diabetes, to have access to clinical trials so they can get the best medical research possible. 
   Organizations such as the National Coalition for Cancer Survivorship, Cancer Care Incorporated, Candlelighters, Childhood Cancer Foundation, Susan G. Koman Breast Cancer Foundation, National Alliance of Breast Cancer Organizations--and the list goes on--want the access to clinical trials that Senator DODD's amendment offers because those are the clinical trials that will assure that women, maybe, in the future, will not have to have a mastectomy. 
   I agree with the Senator from Maine. We want to make sure HMOs are not having drive-by mastectomies, where a woman is sent home. I commend her for the language of her amendment, except for the very first line, which cynically wipes out the clinical trials that Senator DODD has offered.

   Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I am extremely concerned, as I am sure my colleague from Connecticut is as well, that an objection was heard and we were not able to just add this language directly to the underlying amendment on clinical trials, because what the Senator from Maine has now done is forced us into a vote where we would be voting against clinical trials in order for women not to have drive-through mastectomies. That is not a choice Senators ought to be having. 
   In addition, what it says to women across this country is you have a choice, a mastectomy or a clinical trial. That is not a choice we should be offering. 
   I really hope our colleagues on the other side of the aisle will reconsider their objection to this and we can work this out. The people of this country are watching this debate, asking whether or not we are going to move forward and give patients the ability to have the best care possible. If we can work out this amendment and add it to the clinical trials, we will have done the people of this country a service. 
   Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of our time, and I yield.

   Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, my colleagues have clearly spelled out the intent and necessity of this amendment so I will not take much time to go through its benefits. I came to the floor simply to urge my Republican colleagues to really think about how much more protection this amendment provides their constituents than their bill does. 
   The so-called access to speciality care provisions in the Republican bill are nothing more than a statement on the importance of speciality care. They do not guarantee the care; they simply reiterate current insurance practices. 
   During committee consideration of this legislation, a similar amendment was offered to ensure access to specialists and to ensure that patients could designate a specialist as their ``care coordinator.'' During that debate in committee, we heard a great deal about training and experience. We were told how an oncologist was a trained specialist in treating cancer regardless of the age or gender of the patient. We were told a neurologist was a trained specialist regardless of the age or gender of the patient. We were told the training was the same and practice experience was not important. 
   I find this hard to believe, I ask my colleagues again: is there a difference between treating a child with cancer and treating an adult? Are the treatment regimes for a 3-year-old with a brain tumor the same as those for a 50-year-old? I doubt it. It seems likely to me that a cancer treatment regime for a 50-year-old could kill a 3-year-old. That treatment could render the child disabled or seriously impair his or her developmental progress. 
   I urge my colleagues to talk to people at their children's hospitals, to their pediatricians, to their ob/gyns and to their cancer specialists. I have. And what I heard was that patients need to see the specialists most qualified and trained to deal with them and their specific illnesses. 
   If your child had a brain tumor, would you want to be told there are no pediatric neurosurgeons or pediatric oncologists in your network, but that on page 215 of your physician directory you will find a list of the oncologists approved by the plan? I certainly wouldn't. I would want a specialist trained in pediatrics. 
   The Republican bill does not allow for access to speciality care. It is that simple. You can say it does and in fact some of my colleagues may hope it does, but it does not. I can assure my colleagues that the language in both the bill and the committee report will allow plans--not your specialist--to make the final determination on access and treatment. 
   Here is what the committee report says:  
   This section would NOT prevent a plan from requiring that the specialists adhere to a treatment plan if it: (1) is developed by the specialist in consultation with the patient and the patient's primary care provider; (2) is approved by the plan; and (3) meets the quality assurance and utilization review standards of the plan.  
   What does this mean? 
   It means that if the patient is lucky enough to get a specialist, that specialist--who is a trained and qualified doctor--could be required to meet the plan's treatment standards. So maybe you could see a specialist, but you might not be allowed to be treated by one. 
   Yesterday we offered the Robb/Murray amendment to allow women direct access to their ob/gyns. It was defeated. 
   Today we are offering a broader amendment in the hopes of giving all insured Americans the hope that they can get the best care possible for their sick or injured child. If we do not adopt this amendment, once again the patient loses and the insurance company wins. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this amendment and yield back my time.

   Mr. MURRAY. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with Senator GRAHAM in support of access to emergency room care. During consideration of a Patients' Bill Rights in the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, I offered a similar amendment in an effort to prevent insurance companies from denying access to life saving emergency care. Unfortunately, my amendment was defeated on a straight party line vote. 
   I had offered the amendment because of problems that I have heard from emergency room doctors and administrators about creative ways insurance companies seek to deny access to emergency care. I offered the amendment because I have seen in my own state of Washington the inadequacy of simply saying care is provided if a prudent lay person deems it an emergency. We have a prudent lay person standard in the State yet we have seen where patients are turned away and reimbursement is denied. 
   The big flaw with the Republican bill regarding emergency room care is the lack of coverage of poststabilization care. This is the key different between our bill and that offered by the Republican leadership. We recognize the importance of not only administering emergency services but stabilizing the patient as well. 
   Let me give my colleagues an example of the important of poststabilization care; you rush your sick child to the emergency room with a fever close to 105. The fever escalates quickly and without warning. The emergency room doctors and nurses are able to control the fever and stabilize the child, but are concerned about determining the cause of the fever. They recommend poststabilization treatment to determine what caused the child to become so ill so quickly. The insurance company denies this treatment and the parents are told to take their child home and hope to get into see their own primary care physician the next day. Later that evening the child's fever escalates and the child begins to have seizures as a result. The child is then admitted to the hospital for more expensive acute care. 
   Why was follow-up poststabilization care not provided? What are the long-term effects on the child? Did the insurance company save a dime of the  premium paid by hard working Americans? No, in fact their callous behavior resulted in additional costs that could have been prevented. 
   I cannot imagine anything more frightening than holding a child who is experiencing uncontrollable seizures because their tiny body could not endure the impact of a high raging fever. Poststabilization is essential. 
   I urge any of my colleagues who think the Republican bill is sufficient to talk to ER doctors and nurses. Ask them how a patient is treated when brought into the ER. Let me give you another example that was discovered by the insurance commissioner's office in Washington state: 
   A 17-year-old victim of a beating suffered serious head injuries and was taken to an emergency room. A CAT scan ordered by an ER physician was rejected by the insurance company because there was no prior authorization for this test. In other words, we can stabilize the patient, but cannot do any post stabilization treatment to determine the extent of the injuries without seeking authorization from an insurance company hundreds of miles away. 
   Another example, in a state with a prudent lay person standard: The insurance commissioner's office found that an insurance company denied ER coverage for a 15-year-old child who was taken to the emergency room with a broken leg. The claim was denied by the insurer as they ruled the circumstances did not constitute an emergency. This is outrageous. A broken leg is not an emergency? By any standard, prudent lay person or medical standard, treatment of a broken leg would be considered an emergency. 
   I use these examples of real people and real cases to illustrate the flaws in the Republican bill. You can say you cover emergency room care and you can keep saying it hoping that it is true. But, unfortunately, the Republican bill does not provide adequate emergency room coverage. 
   I was disappointed in the HELP Committee markup when my amendment was defeated. I had truly hoped that we could reach a bipartisan agreement on emergency room care coverage. I had seen that we could reach a bipartisan agreement when it came to Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries. We approved these very same provisions for these beneficiaries during consideration of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997. I had assumed that we would give the same protections to all insured Americans. It was a priority in 1997 and should be a priority in 1999. 
   We have spent a great deal of public and private resources to build an emergency health care and trauma care infrastructure that is the envy of the world. This infrastructure has saved millions of lives and provides a standard of care that is hard to beat. Yet policies focusing on restricting access to this care threaten the very infrastructure of which we are so proud. The ER doctor must be the one to administer care without fear of insurance company retaliation. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this amendment to provide 160 million insured Americans with access to state-of-the-art emergency room and trauma care. Please do not close the emergency room doors on these families.

   Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise as a sponsor of this amendment to protect women's health. This amendment offers true security to women; it deals with women's access to health care and women's treatment when they receive that care. This amendment ensures women get more than just routine care when they visit their obstetrician/gynecologist and it protects women against the pain and danger of so-called drive-through mastectomies. 
   While the underlying Republican bill does allow access to OB/GYN care, the HELP Committee went to great lengths to ensure women only had access for routine care--and nothing more. Let me quote from the committee report, ``The purpose of this section is to provide women with access to routine OB/GYN care by removing any barriers that could deter women from seeking this type of preventive care.'' While the Republicans recognize the need for direct access, the language of their bill and their report makes it clear that direct access is guaranteed only for routine care. 
   Let me explain what that means. If during a routine examination, a woman's OB/GYN finds a lump or an inconsistency in her breast, the OB/GYN would not be allowed to refer the patient for further examination. Instead, the woman would have to go back to the gate keeper and hope that her primary care physician approved the referral. We should all agree this is a waste of time and energy--time and energy that would be better spent dealing with the potential breast cancer. 
   A recent study conducted by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists shows that managed care plans are keeping women from receiving the health care they need and seeing the providers they choose. Sixty percent of all women who need gynecological care and 28 percent of all women who need obstetric care are either limited or barred from seeing their OB/GYNs without first getting permission from another physician. Once the patient is able to gain access to her own OB/GYN, she is forced to return to her primary care gate keeper for permission to allow her OB/GYN to provide necessary follow-up care almost 75 percent of the time. 
   What my Republican colleagues fail to understand is that women need OB/GYN care for much more than simple routine care. They also fail to understand the important relationship between a woman and her own OB/GYN. OB/GYN providers are often a women's only point of entry into the health care system. 
   Our amendment would allow women direct access to OB/GYN care and follow-up care as well. It would also allow a woman to designate an OB/GYN provider as her primary care physician. We know historically that women have not been treated equally in receiving health care. We know that some physicians do not treat women with the same aggressive strategies as they treat their male patients, especially when women complain about depression or stress. 
   What we do know is that OB/GYNs have traditionally been strong advocates for women's health. They understand the physical and emotional changes a women experiences throughout her life. The 1993 Commonwealth Fund Survey of Women's Health found the number of preventive services received by women, including a complete physical exam, blood pressure test, cholesterol test, breast exam, mammogram, pelvic exam, and pap smear, are higher for those whose regular physician is an OB/GYN than for those whose primary care doctor is not. Women are simply afforded greater access to preventive and aggressive health care services with OB/GYNs. 
   I am not sure why some of my Republican colleagues want to deny unobstructed access to important health care services for women. It cannot be about costs. The Congressional Budget Office estimated that the cost of direct access and primary care by OB/GYNs as only 0.1 percent of premiums. If my colleagues are so concerned about costs, can't they at least guarantee that women get the quality health care they pay for? This amendment ensures they will. 
   The other important provision in this amendment prohibits drive through mastectomies. It is outrageous that current trends in health care could force women to endure a mastectomy on an outpatient basis. It is wrong to send these women home to deal with the emotional and physical pain of the operation--as well as with the responsibility for draining surgical wounds and performing other post-surgical care. These women should not be 
   abandoned during their time of need. 
   However, our amendment does not require a woman to stay in the hospital. Our amendment does not require a hospital stay for a set number of hours. Our amendment does require that the physician, in consultation with the patient, decides how long the woman should remain in the hospital. The physician determines what is medically necessary and what is in the patient's best interest. 
   I cannot believe there is anyone in this chamber who would want to see a loved one go through a mastectomy and be forced by her insurance company to go home immediately. If we have any compassion at all we should adopt this provision. 
   Let me respond to one criticism I've heard about this amendment from insurance companies. Some have claimed they do not have a policy of drive through mastectomies. I commend them and hope they would support this amendment to prohibit this cruel practice by other companies. I would also add that while most insurance companies may not engage in this kind of outrageous behavior today, how can we insure they will not tomorrow? 
   Our amendment is about protecting and improving women's health. For that reason, the College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists support it. If my colleagues truly consider themselves champions of women's health, they must vote for this amendment. I can assure you that women will not be fooled by the empty promises in the Republican bill. We know the difference between routine and comprehensive OB/GYN care. We know how traumatic and life-altering a mastectomy can be. We know we need real protection and this amendment provides it. 
   Mr. President, I especially thank Senator ROBB for his leadership on this issue. 
   He is right. There are only nine women in the Senate. We shouldn't have to rush to the floor to defend all of the women in this country every time an issue comes up that affects women's health. This is an issue that affects men as well. It affects their daughters, their wives and mothers, their aunts. I appreciate Senator ROBB and his leadership in making sure that women are protected when it comes to their health care. 
   Senator ROBB did an excellent job of outlining what our amendment does. It does two basic things: 
   It allows a woman the right to choose an OB/GYN as her primary care physician. As every woman in this country knows, their OB/GYN, their obstetrician/gynecologist, is the doctor they go to, whether it is for pregnancy, whether it is for breast cancer, whether it is for health care decisions that affect them later on in life. We want to make sure that women have access to those doctors without having to go back to a primary care physician. 
   When a woman is pregnant and she gets an ear infection, she may be treated dramatically different than someone  else who has an ear infection, for example. A woman needs to have access to the OB/GYN, and this amendment Senator ROBB and I and the other Democratic women are offering assures the woman that access. 
   Secondly, it deals with the so-called drive-through mastectomy legislation where too many HMOs today are telling a woman after this radical surgery----

   Mrs. MURRAY. Thank you, Mr. President, 
   Again, I thank my colleague from Virginia, Senator ROBB, and all of the women and men on the Democratic side who have come out to speak for the Robb-Murray-Mikulski-Boxer amendment, which is so essential to women in this country. 
   I am astounded that the Republicans have fled the Chamber and have not returned to either agree with us in fighting for women's health or to explain why they are going to vote no. 
   I was astounded in committee when I offered this amendment and it was defeated on a partisan vote. Where are our colleagues on the Republican side who have come before us so many times and said that they are going to be there at the Race for the Cure? Where are the men of the Senate, when they have been there so many times, saying: You bet we stand for women's health. 
   This is a women's health issue. Young girls go to a pediatrician until they are 12, 13, or 14. At that time, they change doctors, not a primary care physician but an OB/GYN. Why should they be subjected now to HMO rules that say: We are going to change this, and you are going to have to go to a primary care physician in order to be sent to an OB/GYN? OB/GYNs are our primary care physicians. 
   As I stated this morning, if you are pregnant and have a serious cold or ear infection, or any other challenging problem that develops when you are pregnant, you will be given a different medication, a different procedure that you need to go through than if you are not pregnant. 
   Your OB/GYN is your primary care physician from the time you are a teenager until the time you reach menopause, whether you are there because you are pregnant or there because a physician is examining you to determine treatment. But you are there. The OB/GYN is your primary care physician. This 
   amendment will guarantee it. 
   As Senator MIKULSKI so eloquently stated, a woman who has a mastectomy should not be sent home too soon whether she is 25 years old or 80 years old. In this country, on a daily basis, women are sent home too soon because it is considered, by HMOs, to be cosmetic surgery. This is not cosmetic surgery. A mastectomy is serious surgery. Women should be sent home when their doctor determines they are able to go home. That is what this amendment is about. 
   We urge our colleagues on the other side to vote with us, to join with us in being for women's health care. 
   I thank my colleagues who have been here to debate this issue. I especially thank Senator ROBB, who has been a champion for all of us. I look forward, obviously, to the adoption of this amendment since no one has spoken out against it.

   Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from California, Senator BOXER, who has risen to speak against this amendment, for her courage, and for her reminding all of us of how important this issue is to so many women across this country. 
   I speak today in strong opposition to the DeWine amendment, which once again, attempts to restrict access to safe, legal, affordable reproductive health care services for women. This amendment simply seeks to obstruct a women's right to choose. 
   I know the proponents of this amendment claim they are only prohibiting the use of federal funds to pay for abortion. The truth is this amendment is about the U.S. Senate determining what health benefits federal employees will receive. 
   Health insurance for federal employees is an earned benefit. It is part of an overall compensation package. It is no different than a salary. Through this amendment, Senator DEWINE and his colleagues attempting to give federal taxpayers a say in how federal employees spend their salaries. This is unfair. A federal employee's salary belongs to the federal employee and a federal employee' health benefits belong to the federal employee. 
   Yet, we are here today debating an amendment that is based on the premise that the taxpayer controls federal employee's benefits. Again, health insurance is an earned benefit offered in lieu of income. The value of this benefit is part of the overall compensation for work performed. Why are we attempting to dictate the value or scope of a benefit owned by the federal employee? The answer is because the majority believes it can and therefore that it should. That's unfortunate. 
   I have a solution for federal employees who object to receiving benefits that allow a women the right to a full range of reproductive health care services: refuse to purchase health insurance from a plan that offers these benefits. It's that simple. Since the Federal Employees Health Benefit Plan is, in part, funded by a premium paid by the employee that employee should have the right to refuse to support activities to which he or she objects. Those employees should simply not select these plans. 
   I think all federal employees should be outraged by this kind of amendment that we are debating. Dedicated, hard working federal employees are basically being asked to limit their constitutional right to choose when they enter federal employment. This amendment treats federal employees like second class citizens and gives them no ability to decide what kind of health insurance is appropriate to meet all of their health care needs, including reproductive health. 
   This amendment is not about the federal funding of abortions. This amendment is an assault on women's health. It is a creative way to deny access to abortion services for federal employees and their families. Federal employees should not be captive to the narrow views of a minority of the public. Allowing federal employees to purchase and receive insurance policies that allow them to have an abortion is not direct federal funding of abortion. It is a round-about way to limit some American's abilities to exercise the rights  granted them by the Constitution. I, and the majority of Americans, support that right and the Roe versus Wade decision. This Senate should not undermine the fundamental right of women to decide whether to bear a child. 
   Most of my colleagues know voters would be outraged if they sought to overturn Roe versus Wade. But instead of simply coming forward and admitting they oppose the idea that a woman has a constitutional right to decide what is in her best interest and the best interests of her family, they hide behind arguments about federal funding. Most of my colleagues know that a majority of the population supports the basic of privacy inherent in the Roe versus Wade decision. Abortion, up to viability, is a personal and private matter. Rather than seeking to overturn Roe versus Wade, they have decided to restrict access with a multitude of creative, but similarly offensive, ways. 
   By mandating that insurance companies participating in the Federal Employees Health Benefit Plan deny access to abortion services as part of their defined benefit package, the U.S. Senate is attempting to take a private and difficult decision and add to a woman's hardship by turning it also into a financial burden. 
   Many federal employees simply do not have the discretionary income to pay for an abortion. The cost of this procedure can be high. By removing this health care benefit from all federal insurance plans, we have placed a significant financial burden on employees and their families. For federal employees, the protections guaranteed under Roe versus Wade are seriously jeopardized. Financial barriers can be just as effective for many people as simply overturning Roe versus Wade. 
   I hope this amendment is defeated and that we can recognize the valuable contributions of all federal employees by not forcing them to surrender their rights and protections as a condition of being a civil servant. I also hope that we can stop these constant assaults on women's health care and that of their families. 
   Mr. President, I retain the remainder of our time.

   Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, in 1993, thanks to the hard work of Senator DODD and others, we passed the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA). It was one of the first pieces of legislation that I was intimately involved in passing. During the last six years we've come to realize that it has been a huge success. In fact, as we come to the close of the decade we can honestly say that FMLA has been one of the more useful laws we've passed in the last ten years. 
   Now I want to expand upon that success and allow parents a little bit of time under the current time constraints of FMLA to participate in school activities. The ``Time for Schools Act of 1999'' will allow a parent 24 hours per year to participate in the academic activities of his or her child. This 24 hour period comes from the already available 12 weeks under FMLA. 
   This is something our country needs. Parents overwhelmingly want more time to support their children in school. Businesses thrive when our schools produce well-trained graduates--and parental involvement helps kids succeed. 
   As a parent, I know how difficult and how important it is to participate in the education of children. I have been lucky to have had the opportunity to be involved in the school lives of my children. But many parents don't have the time it takes to do those little things that will assure their child's success in school, because they can't get away from their jobs. 
   By adding academic school activities to one of our most successful laws, we will give parents something they need: time off to become directly involved with their children's learning. 
   These days we have many dual-income families and single parents struggling to work to make ends meet. All of these families know how important it is to be involved in their children's learning. However, the single largest barrier to parental involvement at schools seems to be lack of time. 
   Studies have shown that family involvement is more important to student success than family income or family education levels. In fact, things parents can control, such as limiting excess television watching and providing a variety of reading materials, account for almost all the differences in average student achievement across states. 
   All sectors of our communities want more time for young people. Students, teachers, parents and businesses feel something must be done to improve family involvement. In fact, 89 percent of company executives identified the biggest obstacle to school reform as the lack of parental involvement. 
   And, a 1996 post-election poll commissioned by the national PTA found that 86 percent of people favor legislation that would allow workers unpaid leave to attend parent-teacher conferences, or to take other actions to improve learning for their children. 
   A commitment to our children is a commitment to our nation's future. I want to make sure all young people receive the attention they need to succeed. 
   My legislation will allow parents time to: (1) attend a parent/teacher conference; (2) participate in classroom educational activities; or (3) research new schools. 
   I look at the Family and Medical Leave Act--which has helped one in six American employees take time to deal with serious family health problems, and which 90 percent of businesses had little or no cost implementing--and I see success. People in my state have been able to deal with urgent family needs, without losing their jobs. 
   A 1998 study by the Families and Work Institute found that 84% of employers felt that the benefits of providing family or medical leave offset or outweigh the costs. Taking time out for children not only helps parents and children, but is also beneficial to business. 
   My bill extends the uses of family leave to another urgent need families face--the need to help their children learn. The time is right for the ``Time for Schools Act.''

   Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I am very pleased to join Senator JEFFORDS as he reintroduces the Employment Non-Discrimination Act. As before, I speak as a strong supporter of this legislation, because I have always believed that every single American deserves fair treatment under the law no matter his or her gender, race, religion or sexual orientation. 
   As one of only a few women to ever serve in the United States Senate, and the first ever from Washington state, I understand what it means to be part of a group that seeks fairness and equal opportunity. I have never advocated for any special class, just equal treatment and protection under the law. 
   Not long ago, many thought it would be impossible for women to serve in the Senate or an elected office of any kind. It was felt this was not a suitable occupation for a woman and that simply being a woman meant a person was incapable of meeting the demands of the job. These people alleged that women would somehow jeopardize the work done in the U.S. Congress. While these statements may seem impossible to believe today, they do illustrate what many women faced. However, to our country's benefit, these stereotypes were overcome. I am confident that none of my colleagues today would deny the tremendous contributions women have made here, in the House, in state and local government, and at every level of public service. 
   People suffer when stereotypes based on fear or ignorance are used to justify discrimination. I do not believe elected leaders serve our country well if they deny any citizen equal opportunities and equal treatment under the law. A person's success or failure must depend on his or her qualifications, skills, efforts, and even luck. But, no one, I repeat, no one, should be denied opportunities because of race, gender, religion, age or sexual orientation. No one should endure discrimination such as many people have endured in the workplace because of sexual orientation. 
   I am always disappointed to hear about cases of economic discrimination based solely on sexual orientation. It defies logic that in today's society any employer could refuse to hire an individual, deny them equal pay, or professional advancement and subject them to harassment simply because of their sexual orientation. Our country is based on the ideal of allowing equal opportunity and basic civil rights for all Americans, but we have not fully  achieved this goal. The Employment Non-Discrimination Act will correct that wrong. 
   As we would all agree, discrimination based on race, gender, ethnic origin, or religion is not just unfair, but illegal as well. ENDA would simply add sexual orientation to this list. It is written even more narrowly than current law for other areas of non-discrimination, because it does not allow positive corrective actions such as quotas or other preferential treatment. It simply says that a person cannot be unfairly treated in employment, based on his or her sexuality, whether that person is heterosexual or homosexual. Mr. President, this is a reasonable expectation. In fact, it has become a reality in nine states, including California, Massachusetts, and Minnesota, and in many local jurisdictions across the country. Also, many Fortune 500 companies, such as Microsoft and IBM, have adopted their own non-discrimination policies. Companies such as these recognize that it makes good business sense to value each and every one of their employees equally. It is time that our laws reflect these values as well. 
   Not only do these companies and governments support a non-discrimination policy in the workplace, but the public also supports ENDA by a wide margin, according to a bipartisan 1998 poll conducted for the Human Rights Campaign. This poll found that 58 percent of Americans support the Employment Non-Discrimination Act. This is compelling evidence that Americans are behind ENDA, support expanding these basic civil rights to all, and believe that everyone deserves these rights. They understand that our country will be a better place when discrimination based on sexual orientation in the workplace is put to an end. 
   Mr. President, this is not about one group's protection at another's expense. This issue is still not about allowing a greater window for litigation, as opponents have previously argued. It is about common sense, common decency and our fundamental values as Americans. 
   In the last Congress, we came within one vote of adopting this important, bipartisan legislation. I urge my colleagues now to support this measure so that we can continue our proud tradition of protecting basic civil rights and opportunity for all Americans. Let us join together to pass this bill so that our brothers and sisters, sons and daughters, friends and relatives will have protection against unjust discrimination. We have the opportunity to provide them with these basic civil rights now. I hope my colleagues will seize this opportunity to make our country the just, equal, and fair place it should be.

   Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I hope we can work out an agreement, but I rise today really to express my frustration and outrage with the inability of the Republican leadership to allow a fair and open debate on the real Patients' Bill of Rights. 
   I do not like the idea of tying up must-do appropriations bills to try and force a fair and open debate on access to health care services. However, due to the inability to find a reasonable compromise on the number of amendments, we have been forced to bring this issue to every possible vehicle. 
   I hope we can work out an arrangement with the majority party to do this and to have our opportunity to offer amendments that we think are very important. 
   Sometimes we spend far too much time on issues of little significance to the American people. One of the majority's showcase pieces of legislation in 1999 was to change the name of National Airport to the Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport. We spent more time talking about the name change than we have on debating the Patients' Bill of Rights. 
   When it comes to access to emergency room treatment, or access to experimental lifesaving treatments, we cannot seem to find 3 days for its consideration on the Senate floor. This is the kind of legislation that really does impact American working families. I would argue that it deserves a full and open debate on the Senate floor, allowing us to offer our amendments. 
   The Republican reform legislation reported out of the HELP Committee is not--and let me repeat, is not--a patients' bill of rights. Oddly enough, it excludes most insured Americans and, in many cases, simply reiterates current insurance policy. It does not provide the kinds of protections and guarantees which will ensure that when you need your insurance, it is there for you and your family. 
   Let's face it. Most people do not even think about their health insurance until they become sick. Certainly, insurance companies do not notify them every week or month, when collecting their premiums, that there are many services and benefits they do not have access to. It is amazing how accurate insurance companies can be in collecting premiums, but when it comes time to access benefits, it becomes a huge bureaucracy with little or no accountability. 
   The Republican leadership bill is inadequate in many areas. Let me point out a couple of the major holes that I see in this legislation. 
   During markup of this legislation in the HELP Committee, I offered two important amendments. The first one was a very short and simple amendment to prohibit so-called drive-through mastectomies. 
   My amendment would have prohibited insurance companies from requiring doctors to perform major breast cancer surgery in an outpatient setting and discharging the woman within hours. We saw this happen before when insurance companies decided it was not medically necessary for a woman to stay more than 12 hours in a hospital following the birth of a child. They said there was no need for followup for the newborn infant beyond 12 hours. There was no understanding of the effects of childbirth on a woman and no role for the woman or physician to determine what is medically necessary for both the new mother and the new infant. 
   I offered the drive-through mastectomy prohibition amendment only because an amendment offered earlier in that markup would continue the practice of allowing insurance personnel to determine what was medically necessary--not doctors, not patients, but insurance companies. I offered my amendment to ensure that no insurance company would be allowed to engage in drive-through mastectomies. 
   My amendment did not require a mandatory hospital stay. It did not set the number of days or hours. It simply said that only the doctor and the patient would be able to determine if a hospital stay was medically necessary. The woman who had suffered the shock of the diagnosis of breast cancer, the woman who was told the mastectomy was the only choice, the woman who faced this life-altering surgery, decides, along with her doctor. 
   Unfortunately, my colleagues on the other side did not feel comfortable giving the decision to the woman and her doctor. They did not like legislating by body part; and neither do I. But I could not sit by and be silent on this issue. Defeating the medically necessary amendment, offered prior to my amendment, forced me to legislate by body part. And I will do it again to ensure that women facing a mastectomy are not sent home prematurely to deal with both the physical and emotional aftershocks. 
   For many years, I have listened to many of my colleagues talk about breast cancer and breast cancer research or breast cancer stamps. When it comes to really helping breast cancer survivors, some of my Republican colleagues voted no. I hope we are able to correct this and give all of my colleagues, not just those on the HELP Committee, the chance to vote yes. 
   The other amendment I offered in committee addressed the issue of emergency room coverage. The Republican legislation falls short of ensuring that when you have a sick child with a very high fever, and you rush them to the emergency room in the 
   middle of the night, the child will receive emergency care as well as poststabilization care. The Republican bill simply adopts a prudent layperson standard on emergency care, not care beyond the emergency. 
   That means that a child with a fever of over 104 degrees may not receive the full scope of care necessary to determine what caused the fever to prevent the escalation of a fever once the child has been stabilized. As many parents know, simply controlling the fever is not enough; you have to control the virus or infection to prevent the fever from escalating again. 
   I tried in committee to address the inequities in the Republican bill regarding emergency room coverage. Unfortunately, my amendment was defeated. Let me point out to my colleagues, if they think their language will protect individuals seeking emergency care, they are sadly mistaken. 
   The insurance commissioner's office in my home State of Washington recently initiated a major investigation of insurance companies that had denied ER coverage based on a prudent layperson's standard. The commissioner's office discovered that despite a  State regulation requiring a prudent layperson standard, there were numerous examples of individuals being denied appropriate care in the emergency room. 
   In Washington State, a 15-year-old girl with a broken leg was taken by her parents to a hospital emergency room. The claim was denied by the family's insurer, which ruled that the circumstances did not constitute an emergency. 
   A 17-year-old victim of a beating suffered serious head injuries and was taken to an ER. A CAT scan ordered by the ER physician was rejected by the insurer because there was no prior authorization. This 17-year-old child was stabilized, but the physician knew that only through a CAT scan would they know the full extent of the child's injuries. Yet the insurance company denied payment because they had not approved the procedure. They obviously did not think that a CAT scan was part of ER care. 
   These are examples of gross misconduct by insurance companies in the State of Washington that are supposed to meet the same standard that is included in the Republican bill. As the insurance commissioner learned, a prudent layperson standard still allows for a loophole large enough to drive a truck through. 
   I also want to remind many of my colleagues who support doubling research at NIH that we are facing a situation where we have all of this great research we are funding, and yet we allow insurance companies to deny access. 
   Yesterday we heard testimony at the Labor-HHS Subcommittee hearing about juvenile diabetes. It was an inspiring hearing. We had more than 100 children and several celebrities testify. Yet as I sat there listening to the testimony from NIH about the need to increase funding for research and how close we are to finding a cure, I was struck by the fact that the Republican leadership bill would allow the continued practice of denying access to clinical trials, access to new experimental drugs and treatments, access to specialties, and access to specialty care provided at NCI cancer centers. 
   It does little good to increase research or to find a cure for diabetes or Parkinson's disease if very few people in this country can afford the cure or are denied access to that cure. We need to continue our focus on research, but we cannot simply ignore the issue of access. 
   I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting a real Patients' Bill of Rights that puts the decision of health care back into the hands of the consumer and their physician, that doesn't dismantle managed care but ensures that insurance companies manage care, not profits. 
   I don't want to increase the cost of health care. I simply want to make sure people get what they pay for, that they have the same access to care that we, as Members of the Senate, enjoy as we participate in the Federal Employees Health Benefit Program. The President has made sure we have patient protections. Our constituents deserve no less. 
   I thank the Chair.

   Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise today to express my frustration and outrage with the inability of the Republican leadership to allow a fair and open debate on a real Patients' Bill of Rights. I do not like the idea of tying up must do appropriations bills to try and force a fair and open debate on access to health care services. However, due to the inability to find a reasonable compromise on the number of amendments, we have been forced to bring this issue to every possible vehicle. 
   There are many things we do here that simply do not have the impact we seem to think they do. We spend more time debating a constitutional amendment to balance the budget instead of simply doing the hard work to balance the budget. We proved that despite weeks of debate all we needed to do was make the tough choices and balance the budget. Yet when it comes to something like access to emergency room treatment or access to experimental life saving treatments, we can't find three days on the Senate floor. This is the kind of legislation that really does impact American working families. I would argue that it deserves a full and open debate on the Senate floor. 
   The pending amendment before us is not, and let me repeat, is not a Patient Bill of Rights. Oddly enough it excludes most insured Americans and in many cases, simply reiterates current insurance policy. It does not provide the kind of protections and guarantees that will ensure that when you need your insurance it is there for you and your families. Let's face it, most people do not even think about their health insurance until they become sick. Certainly insurance companies do not notify them every week or month when collecting their premiums that there are many services and benefits that they do not have access to. It is amazing how accurate insurance companies can be in collecting premiums, but when it comes time to access benefits it becomes a huge bureaucracy with little or no accountability. 
   The Republican leadership bill is inadequate in many areas. Let me point out one major hole in this legislation. During markup of this amendment in the HELP Committee I offered a very short and simple amendment to prohibit so-called ``drive through mastectomies.'' My amendment would have prohibited insurance companies from requiring doctors to perform major breast cancer surgery in an out patient setting and discharging the woman within hours. We saw this happen when insurance companies decided that there was no medical necessity for a woman to stay more than 12 hours in a hospital following the birth of a child. They said there was no need for follow up for the newborn infant beyond 12 hours. There was no understanding of the effects of child birth on a woman and no role for the woman or physician to determine what is medically necessary for both the new mother and new born infant. 
   I offered the drive through mastectomy prohibition amendment only because an amendment offered earlier in the markup would continue the practice of allowing insurance personnel to determine what was medically 
   necessary. Not doctors or patients, but insurance company bean counters. I offered my amendment to ensure that no insurance company would be allowed to engage in drive through mastectomies. My amendment did not require a mandatory hospital stay. It did not set the number of days or hours. It simply said that only the doctor and patient would be able to determine if a hospital stay was medically necessary. The woman who suffered the shock of the diagnosis of breast cancer; the woman who was told a mastectomy was the only choice; the woman who faced this life altering surgery. She decides. 
   Unfortunately, my colleagues on the other side did not feel comfortable giving the decision to the woman and her doctor. They did not like legislating by body part. Neither do I. But I could not sit by and be silent on this issue. Defeating the medically necessary amendment offered prior to my amendment, forced me to legislate by body part. I would do it again to ensure that women facing a mastectomy are not sent home to deal with the physical and emotional after shocks. 
   For many years I have listened to many of my colleagues talk about breast cancer and breast cancer research or a breast cancer stamp. When it sometimes to really helping breast cancer survivors, some of my Republican colleagues vote ``no.'' I hope we are able to correct this and give all of my colleagues, not just those on the HELP Committee the chance to vote ``yes.'' 
   I also want to remind many of my colleagues who support doubling research at NIH, that we are facing a situation where we have all this great research and yet we allow insurance companies to deny access. Today we heard testimony at the Labor, HHS Subcommittee hearing about juvenile diabetes. It was an inspiring hearing with over 100 children and several celebrities. Yet as I sat there listening to testimony from NIH about the need to increase funding and how close we are to finding a cure, I was struck by the fact that the Republican leadership bill would allow the continued practice of denying access to clinical trials, access to new experimental drugs and treatments, access to specialities and access to speciality care provided at NIH cancer centers. 
   It does little good to increase research or to find a cure for diabetes or Parkinsons disease if very few can afford the cure or are denied access to the cure. We need to continue our focus on research, but cannot simply ignore the issue of access. 
   I urge my colleagues to join with me in supporting a real Patient's Bill of Rights that puts the decision on health care back into the hands of the consumer and the physician. It does not dismantle managed care. But it ensures that insurance companies managed care, not profits. 
   I do not want to increase the cost of health care costs, I simply want to make sure that people get what they pay for. That they have the same access to cure that we as Members of the Senate enjoy as we participate in the Federal Employees Health Benefit Plan. The President has made sure that we have patient protections. Our constituents deserve no less.

   Mrs. MURRAY. I thank the Chair. 
   Mr. President, I am very pleased to join my colleague, Chairman BURNS, in recommending the fiscal year 2000 military construction bill to the Senate for approval. 
   I begin by thanking him and his staff for being so great to work with. He is right, we are old hands but not that old; and it is great to work with him. 
   This bill, which was reported with the unanimous approval of the Senate Appropriations Committee last week, bears little resemblance to the spending structure proposed by the administration last winter. The administration, in what I consider to be a misguided effort to free up more money for defense spending, proposed a buy-now, pay-later military construction bill. The subcommittee carefully analyzed the administration's plan. We had numerous briefings as well as two subcommittee hearings. Our conclusion was that split funding not only would set a dangerous precedent but also would jeopardize the integrity of the entire military construction program. 
   At the recommendation of the Military Construction Subcommittee, the Appropriations Committee wisely rejected the administration's proposal for incremental funding. With the help of our chairman and ranking member, Senator STEVENS and Senator BYRD, we were able to fully fund our Military Construction Program. Moreover, we were able to surmount the woefully inadequate amounts of funding that the administration sought to spread over the full 2-year construction program. In the end, we increased construction funding for active duty components by $278 million over the administration's total request, and for reserve components by nearly $388 million over the request. 
   We achieved these increases by judicious reductions in other accounts, such as the base realignment and closure account, without jeopardizing the pace of ongoing work. Senator BURNS and his staff deserve a great deal of credit for the thoughtful and careful approach that they took in the drafting of this bill. As always, they have worked hard to produce a balanced, bipartisan product that takes into account both the concerns of the Senate and the needs of the military. 
   In particular, they have done a superb job of continuing to shine the spotlight on the quality of life projects that are so important to our men and women in uniform, and to their families. At a time when military enlistment and retention are in free fall, and the services cannot hope to match the financial incentives of the private sector, quality of life issues are magnified in importance. They do not diminish the importance of readiness projects, but they are a factor in recruiting and retaining our military personnel. 
   Within the budget constraints that we are all forced to operate this year, this bill attempts to meet the most urgent and most timely of the military construction projects available. All of the major construction projects that we have funded have been authorized. In addition, we have ensured adequate funding for family housing and barracks construction, and we have suggested that the Department of Defense revisit the issue of housing privatization to determine if it is a workable solution to our military housing needs. 
   Even so, this bill is $176 million below the military construction bill enacted last year. This continues the recent, and troubling, downward spiral in military construction investment. During a year in which the Congress has made great strides toward addressing the need to enhance defense readiness and military personnel spending, it is disappointing--and in my opinion, shortsighted--to see defense infrastructure needs struggling to keep pace. 
   This is an extremely important bill for our Nation and our military forces. I again commend Senator BURNS and his staff for their excellent work in producing the bill, and I urge the Senate to approve it.

   Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, included in the manager's package is an amendment designed to insert the United States Congress into the Bonneville Power Administration's rate setting process. I believe it is unnecessary and potentially counterproductive. Thus, I do not support it and will work to see it stricken in conference. 
   The BPA next month hopes to initiate the rate case to establish the cost of BPA power and set parameters for funding salmon recovery on the Columbia and Snake Rivers. As currently formulated, the rates established will fund projected fish and wildlife costs through customer rates. The process is working and this amendment could potentially jeopardize it. 
   I, along with other Democratic members of the Northwest delegation, recently sent a letter to Vice President GORE to reiterate our support for the so-called ``fish funding principles'' agreed to by the Administration and BPA. We sent this letter in response to a staff memo initiated by the National Marine FIsheries Service and the Environmental Protection Agency, recommending BPA charge its customers higher rates so it could establish a ``slush fund'' to pay the enormous cost of removing or breeching the four lower Snake River dams. As my colleagues know, there has been no decision that these dams should be removed and therefore there is no need to begin saving for such a controversial plan. Our letter firmly opposed collecting money from ratepayers for costs that may or may not be incurred in the future. Specifically, we opposed ``prepayment of speculative future costs, particularly if those costs are contingent upon congressional action.'' 
   There is no movement afoot by the Administration or BPA to establish such a slush fund. So, there is not a problem to solve regarding slush funds for dam removal. 
   However, we do have a problem to solve: saving our wild salmon. We are committed as a region and as a nation to doing so. These skirmishes over staff memos and rumors simply divide us and divert our attention from the real problems we must solve; the real creative solutions we must fund; the real consensus we must forge. I fear an unintended consequence of this amendment may be to reduce our region's ability to solve this problem on its own. 
   So, Mr. President, this amendment is not helpful. That said, I know I do not have the votes to prevent its inclusion in this bill and thus have worked with Senator GORTON to modify it to make it more acceptable. The amendment now will apply only to this fiscal year, instead of continuing in perpetuity. In addition, the BPA Administration now must set rates with the ``fish funding principles'' agreed to by the Administration and BPA in mind. 
   Let me conclude by reiterating that we have a process working to set rates for BPA customers, which I firmly believe will achieve the vital goal of helping us save fish, and will allow full public and stakeholder involvement. This amendment is unnecessary and diversionary. I look forward to working with Senator GORTON and the Administration to get this language dropped from the bill in conference committee.

   Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, just three weeks ago I joined with 12 of my Democratic colleagues to urge the leadership in both parties of the Senate to take up Y2K reform legislation as soon as possible. We got what we wanted and just completed debate. Many amendments were offered but several that would have improved the bill were defeated. Certainly the bill we passed today is much better than the proposal that passed out of the Senate Commerce Committee months ago. 
   Despite some reservations I voted for this bill, because potential problems associated with Y2K failures and subsequent litigation could be very harmful. Widespread litigation could harm businesses and hurt consumers through increased costs in the essential products and services we use in our information technology dependant lives. Moving the process forward is necessary if we are to adequately protect consumers and the businesses who have done all they can to ensure their products work at the turn of the century. 
   It is important we have mechanisms that will allow for quick remediation of Y2K problems, will encourage companies to correct their mistakes, and will fairly adjudicate cases when mediation fails. We all recognize that computer problems associated with the new millennium could be large. These problems need to be addressed. 
   Washington is one of the most high-tech-dependant States in the Nation. Technology companies make up the most energetic and fastest growing segment of the Washington State economy. Information technology has also become a major factor in the economic engine of the Nation. Many employees and consumers in my State depend on these companies' success. The people I represent could be negatively impacted if we fail to take action on this issue. 
   What we passed today could do much to encourage remediation of the problems we face in addressing the Y2K problem. The bill protects businesses that have acted responsibly and allows for consumers and businesses to punish those who have acted in bad faith. The bill is also limited in scope and time with a sunset date just three years after enactment, which focuses this bill  on the unique, one time event which we are seeking to address. What we have done today is an important step toward protecting consumers and businesses from Y2K problems. 
   That said, I have some concerns about the bill. Individual consumers were not as well protected as they should have been. While we've been able to retain for small businesses as large as 50 employees the ability to get a broad array of damages, we were unable to get a complete exception for consumers. Individuals have less bargaining power and generally don't possess the expertise or money required to protect themselves as well as businesses. Therefore, I am hopeful in conference we will get measures that exempt consumers from certain sections of the bill and allow them greater access and bargaining power when Y2K failures harm them. 
   I also have concerns about the bill's preemption of State contract and tort law. The class action provisions of this bill would allow for either party to remove an action from a State proceeding to Federal court at virtually any time. This impedes State's rights and could harm individual plaintiffs by forcing them to incur more litigation costs by having to start anew in federal court. Unlike large companies, individuals often have difficulty traveling to new venues and paying additional attorney's fees. The court system should encourage individuals who are harmed to seek redress, not discourage them as this bill does. I also hope we can work on this in conference. 
   It is important to note that the version that passed the House of Representatives is an even worse bill for consumers. It does not seek the balance between plaintiffs and defendants, but resembles the pro-defendant bill that originally passed from the Senate Commerce Committee. The House bill is a step backward from what was achieved in the Senate. If we move at all toward the House bill in conference, I would hope and I'm confident that many of my colleagues will join me in opposing the conference report. 
   Overall, passing this bill helps get the process going. It certainly is not perfect and I am hopeful the problems I have outlined can be dealt with in conference. It is also my desire to see the administration get involved in the negotiations at conference. 
   My constituents, high-tech companies, and consumers deserve a bill that is fair and just, allows for remediation before filing suit, and protects people and companies who have acted in good faith.

   Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, this is the Murray-Snowe amendment that concerns our brave young women who serve in the military and their right to pay for their own safe, reproductive health care services. I am here today, again joined by Senator SNOWE and many others, to offer our amendment to protect military personnel and their dependents' access to safe, affordable, and legal reproductive health care services. 
   That is exactly what this amendment is all about--access to safe, affordable, and legal reproductive health care services. That is why the Department of Defense supports this amendment, as does the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. The Department of Defense recognizes that it has a responsibility to ensure the safety of all of its troops, including our women. 
   Many of you may wonder why Senator SNOWE and I continue to offer this amendment year after year. Why don't we just give up? Let me tell my colleagues, the reason I come to the floor every year during the Department of Defense authorization bill is to continue to educate in the hope that a majority of you will finally stand up for all military personnel. 
   As I have in the past, I come here today to urge my colleagues to guarantee to all military personnel and their dependents the same rights and guarantees that are enjoyed by all American citizens. These rights should not stop at our border. We should not ask military service women to surrender their rights to safe, affordable, legal reproductive health care services because they have made a commitment to serve our country. 
   Many of our military personnel serve in hostile areas in countries that do not provide safe and legal abortion services. Military personnel and their families should not be forced to seek back-alley abortions, or abortions in facilities that do not meet the same standards that we expect and demand in this country. In many countries, women who seek abortions do so at great risk of harm. It is a terrifying process. 
   I heard from a service woman in Japan who was forced to go off base to seek a legal abortion. Unfortunately, there was no guarantee of the quality of care, and the language barrier placed her at great risk. She had no way of understanding questions that were asked of her, and she had no way of communicating her questions or concerns during the procedure. Is that the kind of care that we want our service personnel to receive? Don't they deserve better? I am convinced that they do. 
   This amendment is not--let me repeat is not--about Federal funding of abortions. The woman herself would be responsible for the cost of her care, not the taxpayer. This amendment simply allows women who are in our services to use existing military facilities that exist already to provide health care to active-duty personnel and their families. These clinics and hospitals are already functioning. There would be no added burden. 
   I also want to point out that this amendment would not change the current conscience clause for medical personnel. Health care professionals who object to providing safe and legal health care services to women could still refuse to perform them. Nobody in the military would be forced to perform any procedure he or she objects to as a matter of conscience. 
   For those of you who are concerned about Federal funding, I argue that current practice and policy results in more direct expenditures of Federal funds than simply allowing a woman herself to pay for the cost of this service at the closest medical military facility. 
   Today, when a woman in the military needs an abortion or wants an abortion, she first has to approach her duty officer to request from him or her medical leave. Then she has to ask for transport to a U.S. base with access to legal abortion-related services. Her duty officer has to grant the request, remove her from active duty, and transport her to the United States. This is an expensive, taxpayer-funded, and inefficient system. Not only is there cost of transportation, but there is cost to military readiness when active personnel is removed for an extended period of time. 
   As we all know, women are no longer simply support staff in the military. Women command troops and are in key military readiness positions. Their contributions are beyond dispute. While women serve side by side with their male counterparts, they are subjected to archaic and mean-spirited health care restrictions. Women in the military deserve our respect and they deserve better treatment. 
   In addition to the cost and the loss of personnel, we have to ask: What is the impact on the woman's health? A woman who is stationed overseas can be forced to delay the procedure for several weeks until she can get her travel to the United States where she can get safe, adequate, legal health care. For many women, every week an abortion is delayed is a risk to her health. 
   Why should a woman who is serving our country in the military be placed at a greater risk than a woman who is not serving in the military? 
   In talking about this amendment, I am often struck by how little some of my colleagues know about restrictions on reproductive health care services in many other countries. Many of my colleagues may be surprised to learn that in some countries abortions are illegal, and punishment is swift and brutal--not just against the provider but against the woman as well. In these cases, a back-alley abortion can be deadly. Not only are they risking their own health, but they are also risking their own safety and well-being. 
   We are talking about women who are serving us overseas in the military. Why should we put our military personnel in this kind of danger? 
   We are fortunate in this country, because abortion is an extremely safe procedure when it is performed by trained medical professionals. However, in the hands of untrained medical professionals in unsterilized facilities abortion can be dangerous and risky to a woman's health. The care that we expect--actually the care that we demand--is simply not universal. 
   Regardless of what some of my colleagues may think about the constitutional ruling that guarantees a woman  a right to a safe abortion without unnecessary burdens and obstacles, it is the law of our land. Roe v. Wade provides women in this country with a certain right and a guarantee. While some may oppose this right to choose, the Supreme Court and a majority of Americans support this right. However, active-duty servicewomen who are stationed overseas today surrender that right when they make the decision to volunteer and to defend all of us. 
   It is sadly ironic that we send them overseas to protect our rights, yet in the process we take their rights away from them. 
   I urge my colleagues to simply give women in the military the same protection whether they serve in the United States or overseas. Please allow women the right to make choices without being forced to violate their privacy, and, worse, jeopardize their health. This is and must be a personal decision. Women should not be subjected to the approval or disapproval of their coworkers or their superiors. This decision should be made by the woman in consultation with her doctor. 
   The amendment that is before us simply upholds the Supreme Court decision. It is not about Federal funding. It is not about forcing those who constitutionally object to providing these services. It is simply about the degree that we recognize the role of women in the military and whether we give them the respect that I argue they deserve. 
   Mr. President, I yield to my colleague from Maine, Senator SNOWE, what time she would like to use.

   Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, let me conclude by letting my colleagues know that under current law today, a woman who volunteers to serve all of us, to protect all of us and our rights, when she goes overseas to serve us and finds herself in a situation where she requires an abortion, which is a legal procedure guaranteed by the Constitution in this country, has to go to her commanding officer and request permission to come home to the United States, flying home on a C-17, or a helicopter when one is available, to have a procedure that women here in this country who have not volunteered to serve overseas have at their disposal. 
   We are asking a lot of these young women. We should at least provide them the opportunity, as we do under my amendment, to pay for that procedure in a military hospital, where it will be safe, at their own expense. That is the least we should be offering them. 
   In a few moments we will be voting on this amendment. My colleague from New Hampshire has said the vote is close. Every vote will count. There is no doubt about it. So when you cast your vote today, ask yourself if women who serve us overseas to defend our rights should be asked to give up their rights when they get on that plane and they are sent overseas. 
   This is an issue which sends a message to all young people today that when they serve us in the military to protect our rights, we are going to be here to defend their rights as well. I urge my colleagues to vote against the motion to table. 
   How much time do I have remaining?

   Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I will reluctantly vote for this supplemental appropriations bill for three primary reasons: to provide our agricultural producers at least a portion of the support they need; to support our troops in Kosovo; and to assist the desperate Kosovar refugees and Hurricane Mitch victims. I strongly oppose the mining rider added in the middle of the night to this emergency spending bill and am saddened this Congress will not require States to spend of the tobacco settlement funds on actually preventing teen smoking or protecting public health. 
   I very enthusiastically support the $109 million in this bill for direct and guaranteed loans to provide credit for American agricultural producers. This and the other agriculture-related provisions in this bill are vitally important to our growers, providing more than $700 million for important agricultural programs. Every single dollar of this aid is all the more critical because Congress failed to support a funding level that would help producers weather these difficult economic times. I support the Harkin-Dorgan amendment to add $5 billion to this agricultural aid package during the conference committee's consideration of this bill. Unfortunately, the amendment was rejected. Meanwhile, our growers are left waiting for more meaningful assistance as they struggle under the so-called Freedom to Farm Act. 
   This bill also contains vital funding for our military forces in the Balkans. I strongly support the Administration's original request for monies to support the Kosovo effort. I am fully prepared to meet our responsibilities to our troops and personnel involved in this important NATO effort. It is unfortunate the House insisted on adding billions of additional, unrequested funding for defense projects, many of which are unrelated to the NATO action in the Balkans. I also endorse our commitment to assist the millions of refugees, who are victims of this unfortunate conflict. 
   I, too, am pleased this bill provide critical assistance to the victims of Hurricane Mitch. This deadly and destructive hurricane decimated several Central American countries, and has been particularly difficult on families already surviving on subsistence levels. The U.S. should have long ago signaled our commitment to lead the international effort to aid the victims of Hurricane Mitch. 
   These important issues aside, I strongly oppose the rider on mining included in this bill. I do not accept the argument put forth by several of my colleagues on the conference committee that the supplemental appropriations bill was the proper place to address an administrative interpretation of the 1872 Mining Law. Within this bill are two provisions that simply are not emergencies and do not belong. One is the further blockage of the Department of Interior's implementing regulations on hard-rock mining. 
   The other provision is particularly troubling to me for it affects a proposed mine in my State of Washington. Included in this bill is a provision that blocks the Department of Interior 
   from enforcing a recent solicitor's opinion interpreting allowable mill site acerage. That opinion reinterpreted the 1872 mining law and limited the amount of mining waste companies could dump on public lands. For many years, my constituents and people across the nation have been calling for true reform of the 1872 mining law. This late-night change is not what they have been asking us to do. The industry knows these provisions would not win approval in the normal legislative process, so they sought riders on a military and disaster relief appropriations bill. These are issues that deserve to be debated in full and in public, not in a mere 10 minutes, late at night among conferees without the necessary expertise to determine whether this is the correct policy. 
   I want to add that I have spoken with officials at the White House who have shared their concern about these mining provisions. I told them we must not allow this action to be a precedent for how we authorize new open pit mines on our public lands. We should debate reform of the 1872 mining law fully and in the bright spotlight of public review. Protecting the public's interest in their federal lands must be a top priority. They agree. 
   I am also extremely disappointed this bill will allow the states to allocate the federal share of the multi-state agreement (MSA) with the tobacco companies to any program or project they desire. I strongly believe we have missed an historic opportunity to reverse the destruction caused by smoking. It is tragic to think that every day we delay reducing underage smoking, 3,000 children will try this deadly habit. Five million children today will face illness and premature death due to smoking. Yet we are allowing the states to spend the federal share on any program they may chose. 
   I am proud that in Washington state, the state legislature and Governor Locke chose to do the right thing and spend the settlement money working to eliminate the plague of tobacco. However, Washington state is only one of three states using the MSA settlement funds to support public health efforts and smoking cessation. 
   There is some irony in this debate about the role of the federal government in spending so-called settlement monies. The tobacco companies win immunity from future prosecution or liability from the states of federal government and because of states' inaction, the companies will be guaranteed a whole new generation of smokers. By not standing firm and using these monies to eliminate underage smoking and reduce adult rates, the cost of care for these individuals will be the burden of the federal government and federal taxpayers. As members of the Senate, we will have to find the additional funding to pay for increases in Medicare, FEHBP, CHAMPUS, and VA health care costs. 
   I am disappointed that we could not reach an acceptable compromise that would have protected our children, allowed states' reasonable spending discretion, and shielded the federal budget. I am hopeful we can continue to work at the federal level to enact tough, anti-tobacco restrictions, including FDA regulation of tobacco and increased efforts by CDC to help the states reduce the burden of tobacco. 
   Let me address one more topic. This bill transfers the Disaster Recovery Initiative (DRI) program, commonly known as the unmet needs program, from HUD to FEMA. While I do not oppose this transfer, my concerns about  it grew as Congress delayed its consideration of this supplemental bill. President Clinton declared two disasters in Washington state during calendar year 1998, including a slow-moving, on-going landslide in the Aldercrest community in Kelso. For a variety of reasons, FEMA public assistance dollars will not reach Aldercrest victims for some time. That makes the unmet needs money--now administered by FEMA--all the more critical. While I am frustrated with the delay in this process, I am pleased we are moving forward once again. This conference report highlights the conferees interest in ensuring Aldercrest victims get this disaster assistance as quickly as is possible. 
   Mr. President, this is a very difficult vote for me. I chose not to sign the conference report, but I support the bill to help our ailing agricultural producers, support our troops, and provide assistance to refugees and disaster victims.

   Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, there was yet another tragedy in Atlanta this morning. This is one more violent act that brings America together in sorrow. We hope that it is also an opportunity to bring us together to learn some important lessons. What are people--young people especially--saying to us all when they turn to violence to address their problems? 
   This is an American challenge. We all have to do our part--in partnership. We must each do our job, but we must all work together. We in Congress are trying to do our part--passing bills, appropriating funds. But the Congress, like all of us, will do a better job when it really listens to the American people, and listens to young people. Every young person has the capacity to grow up to be a constructive citizen or a violent criminal. It's our job--all of us--to listen better. 
   When we do listen, we find two issues at the core: working in partnership, and improving the tools to help build the adult/child relationship. 
   How do we work together? There are many people who have answered this problem in communities all over the Nation. They abandon turf issues and special interests, they listen, and they remember that the child is at the center of the work. There are specific things we can learn in Congress from these communities--where to find the money and time and energy to get the work done together. 
   How do we improve the relationships and connections that young people make with adults? 
   It frustrates me that we cannot do some fairly obvious things--for young people, families, teachers, and communities. 
   What can we do for students? Why is it that we can't figure out ways of building meaningful roles for young people in their own education, and in their own community? Why is it that if you are too young to vote, you are not taken seriously or treated as a citizen? Why is that when a child's hand goes up in the classroom, that child can't get the attention he or she needs from a teacher? 
   We can do some simple things. We can ask young people what they think about how to prevent violence. We can reduce class size. We can make sure that when we hire more teachers, we have better and smaller schools in which to put them. We all have a role in making these things happen. 
   What can we do to better support parents and families? We all know that a strong family unit is the engine that drives our economy, and that when it works well, it is the best and cheapest prevention program out there. So why is it so difficult to improve the tools and information available to parents? 
   All parents want to do their best, so why is it off limits to talk about the problems with our economy, to talk about how parents spend too much time at work and not enough time with kids? Why can't we do the simplest things to make life easier for people who work harder and harder to provide for their family and spend less and less time with their kids? 
   We can start with something simple, like making sure parents don't suffer at work just because they want unpaid leave time to go to a school conference, or take care of an emergency at their child's day care. We should improve the Family and Medical Leave Act. Again, there are things we all can do to make these things happen.  
   What can we do for teachers and other educators? Why can't we give them a small enough class so they get to know each child, and can find 5 extra minutes with the child who needs the most help that day? Why do we expect our teachers to deal with every educational and social issue under the Sun, but we can't treat them as professionals? 
   We need to reduce class size. We need to improve teacher training. We need to improve teacher pay and professionalism. And, we need to think about one thing we can each do to act as a resource to that classroom. Is there a phone call we could make? An educational tool we could 
   buy for the class? A day we could give to working for the passage of the school levy? There are things we all can do. 
   What can we do to help communities support the adult-child relationship, and build connections for young people? Why is it that we don't have more adults participating in the lives of young people? Why is it that a student can walk from home to school to the mall to the quickie-mart and back home again and feel invisible and anonymous? Why can't we allow our communities into our public school buildings at nights and on weekends? 
   We should expand community education opportunities, and when we offer tax incentives, they should be the right ones that help communities invest in young people. We should each make sure to smile at young people, to keep an eye on them, to set high expectations, and to give them meaningful opportunities. Again, there are things we all must do. 
   All over America, there is a conversation going on around the kitchen table, and on the school bus, and at the mall, and around the water-cooler. We need to listen carefully to this conversation--to what is being said and asked for, and what is not. We need to act carefully, and invest wisely. But, most importantly, each of us need to keep this conversation going--to find out what to do and do it--until we create the America we want for our children and young people. And you know one of the best, most overlooked resources for building the America we all want? The young people themselves. Let's start by listening to them. 
   The juvenile justice bill fails to fully address these problems. While many amendments have been adopted that focus on the right solutions, we failed to achieve support for most of those that would have focused this legislation on those things that could best solve youth violence. With that said, I will vote for the bill because I believe it has many positive provisions that combat youth violence. 
   The bill provides important block grants to States to assist them in their efforts to address juvenile crime. While I prefer a high percentage of these funds be required for prevention, I know my State of Washington intends to continue to invest in steering kids away from crime through proven community-based prevention programs. The bill also provides for Internet filtering and screening software that will allow parents to regulate what their children are viewing over the Internet. It also made transfers of several types of firearms to children illegal. 
   As I have already said, I agree with many of my colleagues who have said that there is no legislative ``quick fix'' to this terrible problem that is destroying so many young lives. The issue of youth violence involves complex and interrelated factors. From prevention programs that involve parents, teachers and communities, to strong law enforcement measures, there are many different tools we must use to attack the problem from all angles and prevent further tragedies like the one in Littleton. 
   We must punish those who commit crimes, but we must also do all we can to prevent crimes before they happen, to intervene before small problems grow to crisis proportions. We must give schools and law enforcement officers the tools they need to identify the warning signs that lead to juvenile violence and to let youth know that crime is not an acceptable answer. 
   While the bill does contain a ``prevention block grant,'' there is no guarantee the money will be used for prevention. Dollars from these grants could be used to build more prisons or increase enforcement. While these are laudable goals, without a guaranteed set-aside for prevention, a State could fail to attack youth violence before it starts. We must reach out to prevent at-risk youth from starting down a path of crime in the first place. While we were unable to secure specific amounts for prevention, I am hopeful that States will use their discretion and undertake prevention programs. An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. 
   Some of my colleagues have offered amendments to provide resources for effective violence prevention, and I am disappointed they have not been adopted. Last week, Senator ROBB offered an amendment that would have provided funds for schools and law enforcement to identify and effectively respond to juvenile violent behavior. It would have established a National Clearinghouse of School Safety Information and provided an anonymous hotline to report criminal behavior and 
   a support line for schools and communities to call for assistance. 
   In addition, the Robb amendment would have provided treatment programs that identify and address the symptoms of youth violence to steer juveniles away from criminal behavior. It also would have provided authorization for afterschool programs, which have been very effective at keeping high-risk youth off the street and involved in activities that assist in their education and growth. 
   I am hopeful that similar legislation will be offered again and that my colleagues will reconsider and give it their support. 
   In addition to my disappointment at the lack of adequate resources for violence prevention, I have other concerns about this bill. 
   I am very concerned about the fate of our youth serving time in prisons and other detention facilities. While we must certainly punish those who have committed crimes, we must make a serious attempt at rehabilitation and not allow juveniles to turn into hardened criminals in the course of their incarceration. It is well-known that juveniles who have contact with adults in prison are further indoctrinated into a life of crime or worse, assaulted or even killed. Current requirements prohibit juveniles, whether they were tried as adult or juveniles, from being kept in any adult jail or corrections institution where they have regular contact with adult inmates. 
   The Hatch bill weakens that standard by allowing ``incidental'' contact and permitting construction of juvenile facilities on the same site as those for adults. Even convicted juveniles should be protected from hardened criminals. Those youth who are the most successful in a mixed juvenile-adult environment will be the ones we will least want back on the streets once they have served their time. It is my understanding that the Feinstein-Chafee amendment improved this provision, for which I am thankful, increasing protection of our children while they are in state custody. 
   I also feel the Hatch bill critically weakens measures to address disproportionate minority confinement. The legislation replaces references to ``minority'' or ``race'' with the vague phrase ``segments of the juvenile population.'' Further, the Hatch bill is less instructive on what must be done to address the problem of discrimination, essentially making the issue a mere concern rather than a problem we must correct. This is the wrong direction to be heading if we truly seek to achieve fair and unbiased treatment of all people within the judicial system. An amendment to correct this problem was defeated. 
   The Hatch bill also contains very troublesome provisions to allow the prosecution of children as young as 14 as adults, and gives prosecutors--not judges--the discretion to try a juvenile as an adult. Judges make judgments; prosecutors prosecute. It is obvious who is better qualified to render an unbiased decision on whether a 14-year-old should be considered an adult. 
   There is another idea missing from this bill. To solve youth violence we must all talk to the true experts: young people themselves. We need to listen to more than the student body presidents and the class valedictorians. We need to hear from ``regular'' kids. 
   I know that I have learned a tremendous amount from doing that. Two weeks ago, I met with 10th graders in Kent, WA who told me some shocking  things. They said that nearly all of them knew where they could get a gun within a day. That is a sad statement abut the lives of our youth. They are afraid and they are thinking about how to defend themselves with a gun. 
   In the end, we were able, through the Lautenberg amendment on gun shows, to close one of the more glaring loopholes that allow young people and children to get guns. After much flip-flop on the issue by Republicans, a handful of their courageous Members lent enough support to this amendment by Senator LAUTENBERG to close some of these guns show loopholes, but this was not until they had tried two amendments of substance on the issue. Furthermore, it took the Vice President of the United States, acting in his role as the President of the Senate, to cast the final vote to break the tie that will help keep kids and guns separate. 
   Overall, S. 254 does much to tackle the tough questions surrounding juvenile justice. But as I have stated, there are a number of ways we could have improved this bill. We need to focus on preventive measures that bring together parents, kids, counselors and teachers; provide resources to enable people to identify and intervene in potentially dangerous situations; and give law enforcement the tools it needs to deal with the symptoms of youth violence not just the results of the violence. 
   I hope in the future we can pass legislation that will address the remaining problems and can come up with even better solutions. We owe that much to our children.

   Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I am pleased to rise today to introduce the ``Community Forestry and Agriculture Conservation Act of 1999.'' 
   Mr. President, all across America we are losing hundreds of thousands of acres of productive forest and agricultural land to urban uses. And with the loss of these lands, we also lose some of our ability to protect watersheds, fish and wildlife, and the rural character and economies of many communities. 
   Local governments and non-profit organizations, including growing numbers of land trusts, are responding to these issues, and to citizen demand that private land provide more public benefit. They have made significant progress by purchasing land outright or protecting it through conservation easements. 
   Unfortunately, communities and non-profits simply do not have the resources to meet public demand for open space protection. And the most traditional means of protection--outright purchase of land or conservation easements--are inadequate to protect larger tracts of forest and agricultural land. 
   Mr. President, the bill I am introducing today would give communities a flexible and dynamic tool to protect forest and agricultural land. In fact, some communities, including at least one in the State of Washington, are already mobilizing to take advantage of the legislation I am introducing today. 
   The concept behind this bill is straightforward. 
   Under my bill, a group of community members and leaders who are interested in protecting a tract of forest or farm land would work with one or more landowners to reach a voluntary sale agreement at fair market value. 
   The community group would then form a non-profit 501(c)(3) corporation with a diverse board of directors. The board of directors could include landowners, conservationists, financial and business leaders, forestry and agricultural professionals, and others interested in managing the land. 
   The non-profit corporation would develop an agreement on what land would be acquired and at what price. 
   In addition, the corporation would develop a binding management plan. The management plan would provide for continued harvest of trees and crops, but in a manner that exceeds federal and state conservation standards. 
   A local government would then issue tax exempt revenue bonds on behalf of the non-profit corporation to fund the acquisition of the land. The bonds would be held and serviced by the non-profit with revenue raised by the continued harvest of trees or crops in accordance with the management plan. The non-profit corporation would also hold the title to the land. 
   In forming the non-profit corporation, community leaders would be required to meet strict standards before bonds were issued. These standards will ensure that public benefits are achieved and abuse is prevented. 
   First, the non-profit corporation must draft a land management plan that exceeds state and federal law. 
   Second, the corporation must enter the land into a permanent conservation easement. 
   Third, the corporation must secure the commitment of a third party 501(c)3 organization or governmental entity to hold the conservation easement. It must also provide the third party with the financial resources needed to monitor compliance with the easement. 
   Last, the corporation must establish a diverse board of directors. No more than 20 percent of the board members can represent a for-profit entity that does business with the non-profit. 
   Mr. President, let me explain why my bill is necessary to make this new approach possible. Current law allows for the issuance of tax-exempt debt on behalf of non-profit corporations, such as hospitals and higher education facilities that require large amounts of capital. This bill ensures forest and agricultural based non-profits can enjoy the same benefits. 
   Once the interested parties complete the management plan, issue the bonds, acquire the land and place it in trust, landowners, local governments, the environment, and the public all benefit. 
   Mr. President, foresters and agricultural producers are often land-rich and cash-poor. My bill would allow landowners to capitalize some or all of their assets. It would also allow landowners to continue harvesting timber from the land but at a lower harvest level. While the non-profit could manage harvest activities on the land, it is more likely it will contract out for these services. This will allow the original landowner or other interested natural resource businesses to manage and receive economic benefits from the land. In addition, this tool will allow the landowner to escape the management problems that arise when urban growth begins to encroach on forestry or agricultural operations. 
   Local governments benefit by continuing to receive tax dollars that result from economic activities on the land. 
   And the land receives better stewardship because broad-based conservation efforts can be undertaken at a lower cost than under more traditional land acquisition methods. Through these conservation easements, non-profits will have the financial flexibility to apply lighter resource management practices on the land. 
   This is an important point. The lower cost of capital and non-profit land management would allow communities to increase conservation benefits. I know many landowners and companies would prefer to increase conservation practices. However, they also have to meet the demands of the bottom-line and stockholders. By reducing these financial pressures, we can provide a higher level of resource protection on these lands. 
   And the higher levels of resource protection can respond to the greatest environmental needs in that region. For example, in my home state of Washington, the non-profit corporation could increase buffer areas along streams to protect salmon runs and engage in habitat restoration. These steps would help my state respond to salmon listings under the Endangered Species Act. 
   Finally, the American people benefit the most. They will have more environmental protection and recreational opportunities without sacrificing an important part of their community's economic and tax base. This tool will also allow communities to promote local ownership of their land and to better control their destiny. 
   Mr. President, in the last three years, Congress and the Clinton Administration have been discussing more and more the issues of ``sprawl'' and ``livability.'' We are finally starting to see at the national level a recognition that the federal government's actions play an important role in how communities grow. These are not new ideas--they have been discussed at the local and state levels for decades. I am  pleased to see Congress and the Administration joining this discussion. 
   We have heard and seen many good ideas and proposals for improving the quality of life in our communities, from greater open space protection to improved transportation infrastructure. I support many of these efforts. 
   However, my bill addresses one aspect of this discussion that is not drawing as much attention in the press. And that is the destruction of farm and forest economies in many regions that are rapidly urbanizing. In the Puget Sound region, growth has choked the economic viability of forest and agricultural operations in many areas. Concerned citizens and governments are forced to try to save forest and farm land on a smaller, more piecemeal basis. As successful and rewarding as many of these efforts have been, we need to give communities the option to save larger tracts of land that cannot be acquired outright. By doing so, we can maintain viable farm and forest operations near growing urban areas, and help strengthen the connection between rural producers and urban consumers. 
   Today, Representatives DUNN and TANNER are introducing this legislation in the House. I am pleased to join their effort on this important issue by sponsoring companion legislation. 
   In closing, I want to emphasize that this is an approach that every Senator can support. It is bipartisan. It is voluntary. It maintains private land ownership and embraces private landowners. It limits government involvement but establishes proper enforcement to prevent abuse. It protects the environment. It provides local control.

   Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, the Senate is focused on many important issues this week, including youth violence, the important Y2K issue, emergency appropriations for our Nation's farmers, victims of Hurricane Mitch, and funding NATO's efforts in the Balkans. These are all very timely and important debates, and I look forward to joining my colleagues in discussing these important issues. 
   For a moment, though, I would really like to focus the Senate on the recent accidental bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade and on the U.S.-China relationship. 
   The bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade cannot be trivialized. As President Clinton has repeatedly expressed, the U.S. and NATO accepts full responsibility for this terrible mistake. We all extend our apologies to the Chinese people and the families of those who were killed and injured. 
   I am prepared to accept that this unfortunate accident caused a lot of anger among the Chinese Government and the Chinese people. That is to be expected. Certainly our country would be outraged and saddened if our embassy had been bombed under such circumstances.  
   But our regret and apologies to the Chinese people do not diminish the fact that we cannot accept the deliberate harassment of U.S. citizens and destruction of U.S. property in China. The reports from China--the television images of our embassy targeted by orchestrated mobs--troubled me a great deal. 
   Americans are dismayed at the growing animosity of the Chinese people towards the United States. For the U.S.-China relationship to succeed, both countries must take strides to ensure that the presentation of the relationship is balanced and fair. Clearly, this did not happen in the days before or after the tragic embassy bombing. 
   I am heartened that things do seem to have calmed down throughout China. It is encouraging that President Clinton and President Jiang have spoken and resumed high-level discussions over the bombing and other important U.S.-China issues. 
   Some of my colleagues have mentioned the phenomenal work of our Ambassador in China, Jim Sasser, who is our former Senate colleague and a close friend. He has served our country with great honor. I commend him and all of our embassy and consulate officers who are serving in China. 
   Ambassador Sasser has given us great insight as he addressed the tragic bombing of the Chinese Embassy and the demonstrations and violence that followed in Beijing and other Chinese cities. 
   Let me share a few of Ambassador Sasser's comments with my colleagues as I do believe they serve as a reminder that the U.S.-China relationship is, in my opinion, one of our most difficult and most important relationships. 
   Ambassador Sasser said,  
   When all the emotion has drained out of this terrible tragedy, then wiser heads in both China and the United States are going to realize it's in both countries' interest to try and resume constructive ties. ..... When we are all through grieving over this very tragic event that occurred, the United States will still be the economic superpower in the world and China will still be the most populous nation in the world and an emerging power in this region.  
   Once again, our former colleague has offered wise counsel to the Senate that will be very important to future China debates. 
   The unfortunate Embassy bombing should not be used by those in China as a justification for severing or postponing ties with the U.S. Nor should China think that this incident will lessen America's resolve as we address the issues of human rights, weapons proliferation, or the issues related to espionage targeted at U.S. nuclear facilities. 
   One of my hometown papers offered the following in an editorial last week, the editorial reads, ``China is furious and rightly so. The test, however, is whether China plays the incident like the country it wants to be, a world leader that sees events and relationships in a larger context.'' I completely agree and I believe that many in Congress will judge China's ability to play a larger role on the international scene by her handling of this temporary crisis in the relationship with the U.S. 
   The United States, and particularly the Congress, must also demonstrate our commitment to responsible global leadership. We should be cautious as last week's unfortunate events enter the contentious political debates over U.S.-China relations. I continue to believe a mature and stable relationship with China is in our national interest. It is not a goal we should be prepared to abandon. A mature and stable relationship is certainly in the best interest of the American and Chinese people. Though progress toward this goal has been hampered by the events of this last week, it is still a goal we should strive for. We must continue our dialogue with China. 
   China should expect continued U.S. interest and in fact, vigilance, on the variety of issues important to the U.S. government and the American people. There will not be widespread concessions granted by the United States. The Embassy bombing was a tragic mistake, not a propaganda tool to be deployed at the bargaining table. 
   Consistent with admitting the mistake and accepting responsibility, the United States and NATO should be prepared to enter into talks with China about appropriate compensation for individual and government losses. This is not unprecedented. In the late 1980's, Iraq paid compensation to the families of U.S. sailors killed in the accidental bombing of the U.S.S. Stark during the Iran-Iraq war. Following the downing of an Iranian passenger plane, the United States offered to compensate the victims families. And the U.S. is now in the midst of paying compensation for property damage and to the victims' families for last year's cable car accident in Italy.

   Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I am pleased to be joined today by Senator WELLSTONE to introduce the Battered Women's Economic Security Act. This has been a seven year effort and one that I will continue to pursue. I want to thank Senator WELLSTONE for his efforts on this important legislation. I also need to recognize the leadership of  Senator BIDEN regarding the Violence Against Women Act. Without his work on this historic legislation since 1994, we could not be here today talking about the economic needs of victims of domestic violence. 
   In 1994, we enacted the landmark Violence Against Women Act. For the first time, Congress said violence against women was a national disgrace and a public health threat. We had to act. This was no longer just a family matter or a family dispute, this was and is a serious threat against women and a serious threat to the community. We have had police officers in Washington state killed responding to domestic violence calls. We have seen too many women in the emergency room and too many families devastated by violence. 
   VAWA set in motion a national response to this crisis. We are now in the process of reauthorizing and strengthening VAWA. This is my major priority. Reauthorization of VAWA cements the foundation we need to build the structure that will ultimately end domestic violence and abuse. 
   The Battered Women's Economic Security Act takes the next logical step. As a result of the work that I have done concerning family violence, I have come to understand that the real long-term solution is to tear down the economic barriers that trap women in violent homes and relationships. 
   Our legislation addresses many of the economic barriers that I know force a cycle of violence. I have met with many of the advocates in the state of Washington and heard from them first hand, about how these barriers make long term security for women and their children difficult. From housing to child care to job protection to welfare waivers, our legislation attempts to deal with the long term economic problems. 
   Women should not have to be forced to choose between job security and violence. Each year one million individuals become victims of violent crimes while working on duty. Men are more likely to be attacked at work by a stranger, women are more likely to be attacked by someone they know. One-sixth of all workplace homicides of women are committed by a spouse, ex-spouse, boyfriend or ex-boyfriend. Boyfriends and husbands, both current and former, commit more than 13,000 acts of violence against women in the workplace every year. This does not include harassment or the threat of violence. Clearly, women face a serious threat in the work place and yet if they leave to avoid harm, they are denied workers compensation. Perhaps even more offensive is the fact that some states require victims of domestic violence to seek employment in order to receive TANF benefits. To have any economic safety net some women are forced to jeopardize their own safety. 
   This is not just an issue that effects victims of domestic violence. We all suffer the economic consequences of violence. it has been estimated that work place violence resulted in $4.2 billion in lost productivity and legal expenses for American businesses. From what I have heard from victims and advocates, this is a very conservative estimate. The health care costs are also equally staggering. Both the American Medical Association (AMA) and the Surgeon General have labeled violence against women a public health threat. Violence is the number one reason women ages 19 to 35 end up in the emergency room. One out of every three women can expect to be the victim of violence at some point in her life. 
   Our legislation would also prohibit discriminating against victims of domestic violence in all lines of insurance. If a woman seeks treatment in an Emergency Room and reports this as domestic violence, she should not be denied disability or life insurance. If an estranged husband burns the house to the ground the woman should not be denied compensation simply because it was an act of domestic violence. To say that victims of domestic violence engage in high risk behavior similar to sky diving or race care driving is simply outrageous. It is the ultimate example of blaming the victim. 
   Our legislation is not the final solution, but it begins the process of addressing long term economic needs. I am hopeful that once we have secured reauthorization of VAWA we can begin to focus on these economic problems. Without VAWA we have no foundation. 
   I will be working with PAUL and other Members of the Senate towards enactment of key provisions of the bill. I am also committed to continuing my work with Senator BIDEN in an effort to enact Violence Against Women Reauthorization during this session. 
   I urge all of my colleagues to review the Battered Women's Economic Security Act. I encourage all of you to talk to your advocates and your police, ask them what issues keep women trapped in a violent home or relationship. Ask them what needs to be done to provide long term solutions. I know that after careful review and consideration, you will reach the same conclusions. There are economic barriers that must be torn down. I hope that many of you will join in cosponsoring this legislation and work with me to enact this comprehensive solution to ending the cycle of violence that too many women and children face every day.

   Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about an issue of great importance to Washington State and our country. I know it is an issue the Presiding Officer, the Senator from Washington, shares concern with me. There has been a lot of talk in recent months in the media and on the Senate floor about Microsoft and the Department of Justice. I want to take a few minutes today on the Senate floor and share a few of my thoughts on Microsoft. 
   Recently, Microsoft's competitors and critics have portrayed Microsoft as a serious threat to the technology sector. I can speak from experience about Microsoft. The Microsoft I know is far different than the ruthless company that has been described in newspaper articles. My own professional and political career covers the 20-year period of Microsoft's growth from the first personal computers to today's innovative software programs which have spurred consumers and educators and students and the business community to the reinvention of their daily lives. 
   Almost everyone is familiar with Microsoft and its products. Bill Gates and Paul Allen, the company's founders, had one vision in mind--that one day every home and family would have a PC. It was an ambitious goal but one that seems more attainable every day. Through the years, the company has developed tremendous innovations in the technology industry, but Microsoft is more than the product it makes. I want to take some time today to talk about the things Microsoft does to make the lives of everyone in our country better. 
   I have spent most of my career as an advocate for education. I have traveled all across my State visiting schools and talking to students, parents, teachers, and local business leaders. I have worked hard to put computers into schools and train teachers in the use of technology and make sure that all children, no matter who they are or where they come from, has access to technology and the opportunities such skills and knowledge bring. 
   If there is one thing I have learned, it is that providing a good education, if we want to do it, takes the involvement of everyone, and that is particularly true of businesses. Microsoft believes one of its most important goals is to build technology to empower teachers and families to make lifelong learning more dynamic, more powerful, and more accessible. To this end, Microsoft contributes more than a half billion dollars annually for education, workforce training, and access to technology programs. 
   Microsoft is a leader in education technology. Through its connected learning community effort, they help students and educators and parents access technology, and through its ``Working Connections'' program, Microsoft supports technology training for underserved populations through the Nation's community college system. If we want our young people to compete for high paying technology jobs, we need to make sure they have the right skills. 
   Microsoft is also a leader in addressing the technological gap in many communities across our country. The Gates Library Foundation grants provide public access to the Internet in underserved areas in both rural and urban settings. Their ongoing financial commitment to this effort is making a real difference for underserved populations and areas. 
   I tell you these things today because I know firsthand of all the great things Microsoft and its employees are doing to bring new inventions and opportunities to American consumers. 
   When a grandfather learns how to e-mail his grandchild and play a larger role in that child's life, I appreciate Microsoft's efforts on behalf of families. When a Washington State family finds work in the technology sector, I appreciate Microsoft's contribution to my State's economy. When a child discovers the Internet as an educational tool for the first time, I see a child filled with excitement, for learning and hope for the future, 
   and I thank Microsoft for helping to make that possible. That is the Microsoft I see and that is the Microsoft I represent in the Senate. 
   Now, we all know that high technology, and particularly the software business, is immensely competitive. Certainly, Microsoft, and all the other Washington high-tech firms, compete vigorously. That is the nature of these industries. Washington State has become a high-tech leader through hard work, a dedicated and creative workforce, and an unmatched quality of life. 
   Microsoft has enjoyed immense success over the years and continues to grow at an impressive rate. This success has been hard fought, however, and has recently drawn the oversight of the Department of Justice. 
   The Department of Justice has alleged consumer harm, but I have to ask: Where are the consumers who have been hurt? There is no consumer uproar over Microsoft or its business practices. Microsoft's business model--high volume, product sales at low prices--is both successful and proconsumer. 
   Microsoft's consumer benefits are well understood by the American public. A recent nationwide poll conducted by Hart-Teeter found that 73 percent of those polled believe Microsoft has benefited consumers, and 69 percent of those individuals have a favorable impression of Microsoft. 
   While those results do not surprise me, I was surprised to learn that 66 percent of those polled believe that the Government should not be pursuing this case against Microsoft, and more than half of the respondents believe that this case represents a poor use of tax dollars. 
   I have read the complaint filed by the Justice Department and I have followed the court proceedings in this case. I have seen how easy it might be to conclude, based on press reports, that Microsoft is faring poorly in the courtroom. The vigorous courtroom presentations during the trial have led to an aggressive public relations effort outside the courtroom. I think it is time for the parties in this case to move to a more productive dialogue. 
   The judge in this trial has implored both sides to seek a settlement. And I agree. Microsoft and the Justice Department should do all they can to meet the judge's request. Both sides should be free to pursue a settlement in private and free from the influence of the public and their competitors. Settlement of this case will mean that consumers will continue to benefit from Microsoft's innovative products and the antitrust claims will be put to rest. 
   At issue here is more than just the fate of Microsoft. The resolution of this trial will have broad implications on the software industry as a whole. Microsoft employs more than 30,000 people, including 15,000 from my home  State. The U.S. software industry employs more than 600,000 people and enjoys an annual growth rate of 10 percent. 
   The industry paid more than $36 billion in wages to U.S. employees in 1996. Software and high-tech companies have been the driving force behind the economic expansion that we continue to experience here in the United States, and much of our economic future lies in these knowledge-based industries. We have to be cautious and thoughtful about Government intervention so that we do not stifle the economic promise that software and high-tech companies offer. 
   Of course, we should not protect companies or guarantee profits and market share. But we--as legislators and as the Federal Government--must be careful to correctly interpret the state of competition. My own view is competition is alive in this industry. Any tech company that rests on its current product line or stock price risks a quick and decisive downfall. 
   While Microsoft is headquartered in Redmond, WA, my remarks are more than a defense of a constituent company. My concerns should be felt by every Senator on this floor. 
   A recent piece in the Wall Street Journal offered the following passage:  
   Dominant firms are the norm in high tech. TV ads boast that virtually all internet traffic travels on Cisco systems. Quicken has 80 percent of the financial-software market. Netscape once boasted of having 90 percent of the browser business. Intel still has 76 percent of the microprocessor business. America Online, Lotus Notes and Oracle all dominate their respective markets. Executives who work in such glass offices should think twice before encouraging zealous prosecutors and gullible reporters to define monopoly as a large share of an artificially tiny market.  
   The high-tech industry employs 4.5 million workers across this country. According to the American Electronics Association, 47 of the 50 States added high-tech workers between 1994 and 1996. It is not just States such as Washington and California and Texas that are booming as a result of technology jobs. Georgia, Colorado, North Carolina, Oregon, Illinois, Virginia, Florida, and Utah are States that are experiencing phenomenal job growth in the tech sector. 
   To maintain this impressive nationwide job growth in the technology sector, the Congress and the Federal Government must be careful. Let's not forget that most of this phenomenal growth occurred over the last decade when technology was not on either the Federal or congressional radar screen. 
   Before yielding, let me reiterate the points that brought me to the floor today. I hope each of my colleagues will give serious consideration to these issues. 
   Microsoft is a true Washington State and American success story that is still unfolding for the benefit of consumers, business and the general public. Microsoft has a particularly impressive record of community activism, and I am especially proud of the company's efforts in the area of education. 
   The ongoing court case is of utmost interest and importance to me in the work I do in the Senate. I implore all parties to give the legal system an opportunity to work. Judge Jackson has urged both parties to seek a settlement, and I strongly encourage them to heed the judge's advice. 
   Finally, the outcome of the Microsoft case will have long-term ramifications on our Nation's economy. Technology is growing rapidly, and we all know many technology jobs are high-paying, family-wage jobs. The United States is a technology superpower. The Federal Government must use its immense powers with care and caution in monitoring the technology sector. When the Federal Government interjects itself in this intensely competitive sector of our economy, it must ensure that it does not do serious damage to our economy. 
   Mr. President, I again urge my colleagues to pay attention to the Microsoft case. I look forward to discussing this issue with my colleagues again on the floor of the Senate.

   Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, while I have the floor, I want to turn quickly to a different topic, and that is on the issue of education and class size. 
   I know my colleagues have watched me come to the floor and talk numerous times about how important it is that we reduce class sizes in the grades of 1 through 3. I have talked about the research in this country which has shown that reducing class size makes a difference for our students.

   Mrs. MURRAY. This is a report about a study that researchers in Tennessee began many years ago in relation to reduced class size in the first through third grades. They followed those young people all the way through to the point where they are now graduating this year. 
   It is a very impressive study. It shows exactly what I have been debating on the floor of the Senate; and that is that students who are in smaller class sizes in the first through third grades are more likely to pursue college, have higher graduation rates, they achieve at higher levels, and it makes a difference in discipline. 
   Mr. President, it seems to me that we have to get back to this issue. I urge all of my colleagues to take a second look and recognize that we can make a difference by continuing our support of class size reduction and teacher training here in the Senate. 
   I ask unanimous consent that the 23 Senators on the list that I send to the desk be added as cosponsors to my bill, S. 564, the Class Size Reduction and Teacher Quality Act of 1999.

   Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, yesterday's tragedy in Littleton, Colorado has brought the nation together in our sense of shock and horror. I want the people of Littleton to know that they are in our thoughts and our hearts. We cannot know the devastation they must feel, and we can only imagine, ``what if that were my child?'' In this time of terrible sorrow, your nation sends its profound sympathy. 
   Yesterday, two heavily-armed students went into Columbine High School in Littleton, in what has been described as a suicide mission, to bring violence and death on their classmates, their teachers, and themselves. 
   One student last night, a girl from another high school who visited Columbine to show her support, made a very important observation: ``People always say `it couldn't happen here; it couldn't happen to me,' well, it did happen here; it did happen to us.'' We must ask ourselves what we can to stop this senseless violence from happening again in another town, another community, another school. 
   As we begin to sort through the aftermath of this terrible tragedy, inevitably we will arrive at the question ``why?'' It is too easy for a young person these days to feel anonymous--to go unseen. Too many young people in America will wake up today, walk through the neighborhood, attend a crowded school, walk through the shopping mall, and return home--without ever getting acknowledgment or recognition or support from even one adult. 
   As a nation, we must make a determined effort to change this unfortunate fact. We have a responsibility to the nation's young people to do better. I have talked to too many young people who say that ``adults just don't seem to care about me.'' Sometimes just a conversation or even a smile can send an important message to a young person--``You matter. I want things to go well for you. If you need help, I'm here.'' 
   Young people today are different in many ways than when we were young, but one thing hasn't changed. They still need our understanding, and our compassion. And they need to know that someone cares about them so that they don't see violence as a solution. Violence is not an option. We cannot tolerate violence in our schools. 
   Tragically, these two students at Columbine High School, who so desperately wanted someone's attention have finally succeeded. In their cry to be heard, they have done irreparable damage to the families and community of Littleton. And as we search for an explanation, we find ourselves struggling to understand who those two boys were and how they could commit such an awful crime. 
   There is not a legislative solution to the problem of violence in our schools. Instead, we must begin a national dialogue about what we all can do to let children know that violence is simply not acceptable. As we all reflect on yesterday, each one of us should ask ourselves what we can do to make a difference. We each must take responsibility to do a better job in letting all children know that adults care about them ..... that there are other ways to make their voice heard ..... that they matter. 
   For the last three years, I have cosponsored, with former Senator Kempthorne, a resolution establishing the Day of Concern About Young People and Gun Violence. Every year we have received dozens of Senate cosponsors--56 last year--and widespread support from the Parent-Teacher Association, Mothers Against Violence in America, the National Association of Student Councils, and others. 
   But more importantly, last year more than a million students signed a pledge promising they would never take a gun to school, would never use a gun to settle a dispute, and would use their influence to prevent friends from using guns to settle disputes. I hope all of my Senate colleagues will join me this year in cosponsoring and passing this important resolution establishing the Day of Concern on October 21, 1999. 
   Thank you, Mr. President.

   Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, today we have an opportunity to discuss passage of the first education legislation of the 106th Congress. My sincere hope is that this is only the first step in bipartisan agreement about the path we are traveling toward improving America's schools. 
   The Education Flexibility Partnership Act itself is not an earth-shaking proposal. Essentially, for a set of provisions under a list of Federal programs, school districts will be able to get waivers from their States instead of having to ask Secretary Riley. Since Secretary Riley grants these waivers fairly routinely, some might ask why we need this bill. There has been so much talk about the great things this bill contains that I just want to clarify what we are talking about. 
   Within the bill, we are not reducing paperwork or bureaucracy or cost or time spent away from the classroom. You will hear from some of my colleagues that this bill does all those things and probably many other claims. To some people, Ed-Flex has become the great tonic that will fix all the ailments of our schools. 
   I want you to notice something that Senator FRIST has mentioned that I agree with. Ed-Flex is not a silver bullet or a panacea. It will not solve all the challenges our schools face. 
   The important part of the message that does not always get through is that no effort in the Congress or in your local school is that silver bullet or that panacea. The problems that affect today's schools, as we saw yesterday in Colorado, are never easy to solve. They are always more complex than a sound bite. Always. 
   Each part of the American school community, from classroom to committee room, must do its part. Every student, every family, every educator, every community leader, every local school board, every State government, and every national policymaker--all of us must do what we can. 
   The language of the Ed-Flex bill does not really provide any direct relief to any of these problems. All it really does is say that in addition to asking Secretary Riley for a waiver from a provision of a Federal program, you can now ask your State officials. 
   So why would someone like me, someone who is a parent, a preschool teacher, a former school board member, why would I come to the Senate Chamber and proclaim that we should pass the Ed-Flex bill? Because it can help change thinking, and that is a vital and important goal. 
   Education flexibility is an important idea and concept. If, by passing this expansion of the education flexibility program, we can change the thinking in just one community about what steps they can take to improve their local public school, then that is a major victory. 
   Too many local decisions, things that would directly improve the learning of hundreds of children, are stopped before they get started. The message this Congress needs to say to local communities is, if you have a proven, effective way to improve learning for your students and you have your community behind you and you are willing to be held accountable for the results, we should be doing everything we can to get the obstacles out of your way. 
   Sometimes the obstacle is a Federal law or regulation. Sometimes the obstacle is a State law or a State regulation. Sometimes the obstacle is a local school board policy that needs to be changed. Sometimes the obstacle is the bus schedule or the school lunch schedule or the sports schedule. Sometimes, believe it or not, the obstacle to improvement does not have anything to do with education law or with government at all. 
   Whatever the obstacles are, we all have a responsibility to do what is best for the students by holding the school accountable and helping them get the obstacles out of the way. 
   My belief is that we should all be thanking Senator WYDEN and Senator FRIST, Senator KENNEDY and Senator JEFFORDS for giving us an opportunity with this bill to help change thinking across this Nation, to remind communities that they have more power than they know to make improvements in their schools, and to say in a meaningful way that their Federal Government is their partner in making their best schools better or in helping their struggling schools to thrive. 
   There are plenty of great schools and plenty of great thinking out there right now without any further action on our part. But this bill will encourage the discussion that is happening at every local school about how to improve student 
   learning and how to get even our best schools performing at higher levels. Great thinking alone will not do it. 
   That brings me back to my statement that although the Ed-Flex bill is the first education bill in this Congress, it cannot be the last, because what local school communities need more than flexibility are the resources and support to do something positive with it. 
   The Ed-Flex bill alone will not give your students more individual attention in the classroom. The Ed-Flex bill alone will not stop up a leak in your school's roof, unless it is a very small one. The Ed-Flex bill alone will not improve teacher training or any number of other important issues that real people across this Nation have to deal with every day, which is why it is important for me and many of my colleagues to start the larger debate about education with this bill. 
   We know we will not have many opportunities this year. This Congress must continue to address the very real needs of school communities. The public school is a powerful engine for social improvement and equity of opportunity. Millions of Americans have created lives that were measurably better in all ways than that of their parents because of something they learned in a public school. 
   As communities continue to update and improve and redesign their own public schools to meet the changing needs of our economy and society, they will need a very real, measurable investment from the other members of this great community we call our Nation. 
   We must continue our important national investment in reducing class size by helping communities to hire 100,000 well-trained, high-quality teachers. We must do everything we can to improve the professional development and ongoing education of our teachers to make sure they are ready for each challenge they face with each student each day they enter the classroom. 
   We must use every tax bill this year as a vehicle to help school communities modernize their school buildings and technology capabilities. 
   None of these, nor the many other important investments we should make, should be seen as a silver bullet or a panacea. But when you give local communities the freedom from regulation that we continue by expanding the education flexibility program today, and then combine that flexibility with the very real investment in the communities' ability to hire good people, to improve school buildings, to pay for improvements to the teaching process, and to choose the very best educational tools possible, then you are doing  something really big, then we are talking about a major investment in our Nation's future which will pay off for us in many ways--reduced crime, more economic opportunity for people, the improved well-being of our neediest citizens, better citizenship, stronger communities with an improved quality of life for all of us. 
   That is why I and my colleagues have come to the debate on the Ed-Flex bill and also talked about the other important national investments we must make and continue to make in our schools. 
   In the process, there have arisen some threats to that overall, more important national effort. There was an amendment to this bill that would have undone the very important, vital, bipartisan agreement we all came to last year in helping communities reduce class size. If that amendment had prevailed, 
   we would have seen communities--communities that are now struggling to put together their budgets for next year--we would have seen them forced to make some very ugly choices in school board meetings that already have enough disagreement and contention. 
   The good news is, that amendment which would have forced school districts to pit special education and regular education students against each other has been dropped. In its place, we have bipartisan language which will allow more flexibility to the very small school districts who have already reduced class size. That is progress. 
   This year, we can have the opportunity to debate class size reduction and many other efforts to improve communities' abilities to improve their schools. My hope is that we take that opportunity. My hope is that we have a full discussion and make some compromises and get to further progress. 
   Passing the Ed-Flex bill is a good first step. Continuing with our effort to leverage class size reduction across the Nation will be a good next step because school boards are making those decisions now. Moving forward on school construction this year will be another good move. 
   Increasing funding for special education by at least $500 million will be another step towards progress. Improving the resources communities have to improve teacher training will be progress. We should reauthorize the elementary and secondary school bill this year, just as we are scheduled to do. 
   We must continue talking and working. It is what the American people expect of us. It is our responsibility. 
   We must increase flexibility and resources at the same time. People want their schools to have the freedom to act and the funds to pay for it. Most people are, frankly, shocked by the fact that less than 2 percent of our overall national spending goes to education. We must make that a higher priority. We have started our work. Now let's continue and do our part in the great partnership we call America's public schools. 
   Thank you, Mr. President. 
   I reserve the remainder of our time.

   Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I came here today to talk about the work we are doing to protect our environment, but first I would just like to express my deep sorrow over yesterday's tragic shooting in Littleton, Colorado and to tell the students, teachers and their families that they are in our thoughts and our hearts. 
   Mr. President, we are here to celebrate the last Earth Day before the 21st century. As a nation, we have made great strides in the last three decades in protecting important ecosystems, cleaning up past mistakes and improving the environmental records of industry and agriculture. I am confident that as we move into the 21st century, our Nation will continue to be a leader in both environmental protection and economic strength. 
   In the Pacific Northwest, one of our most pressing challenges is to restore our dwindling wild salmon stocks. This year, the Puget Sound chinook salmon  was listed on the endangered species list, making it one of the first species in the Nation to require protection efforts in an intensely developed metropolitan area. 
   This will give our region an opportunity to highlight again how we can both thrive economically and provide critical protection to other species. Already we have seen examples across our State. Farmers have modified irrigation systems to make them more salmon-friendly. Forest landowners have foregone timber harvest in sensitive areas and replanted along streams with vegetation particularly beneficial to fish. Citizens of our urban areas have taken the first steps toward a comprehensive plan to restore urban salmon and have joined forces to restore devastated wetlands and streams. 
   One of the important lessons we should have learned about environmental protection is it is much easier--and far less costly--to preserve an ecosystem rather than try to repair it once it has been destroyed. That is one of the reasons I am pushing my colleagues so hard to pass my legislation to create a Wild and Scenic River on the Hanford Reach of the Columbia River. These are the last free-flowing 51 miles of this mighty river and they contain some of the most productive and important fish spawning habitat in the lower 48 States. The reach produces 80 percent of the Columbia Basin's fall chinook salmon, as well as thriving runs of steelhead trout and sturgeon. While most of the Columbia River Basin were being developed during the middle of this century, the Hanford Reach and other buffer areas within the Hanford Nuclear Reservation were kept pristine by the same veil of secrecy and security that lead to the contamination of the central Hanford Site. 
   Mr. President, we have been offered an opportunity to continue to grow the rural economy of central Washington while protecting this vital source of our economic strength that the Columbia River provides. Creating a Wild and Scenic River could help us avoid drastic protection measures, like breaching the dams along the Columbia Snake River systems to save salmon. This simple step will demonstrate our commitment both to protecting wild salmon and to the economic and social structure of the inland West. 
   Today, we also celebrate the introduction of legislation to protect another national treasure: the wilderness of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. Senator ROTH will again introduce, and I will cosponsor, his bill to protect one of the only remaining complete and undisturbed arctic ecosystems in the world. It is home to an abundance of wildlife, including grizzly and polar bears, musk-oxen, wolves, and a host of migratory bird species. It is also home to the magnificent porcupine caribou herd, whose 160,000 members rely on this coastal plain for their calving grounds. 
   This bill will prohibit development of oil within the fragile wilderness of the refuge. Oil development would likely disrupt the porcupine caribou and force them to change their calving grounds and migratory routes. This, in turn, will adversely impact the lifestyle and culture of their neighbors, the Gwich'in people. 
   Proponents of development claim that only 13,000 acres of the refuge will be impacted. While this may be true, that development will take place in the biological heart of ANWR and have a devastating impact on the wilderness values of the area. In this biological heart, developers will create a major industrial complex. They will build hundreds of miles of roads and pipelines, erect housing for thousands of workers, and construct two sea ports and one airport. These developments will lead to mining of enormous amounts of gravel, will require diversion of streams and will result in pollution of fragile tundra. 
   Mr. President, as we celebrate the last earth day before the 21st century, I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to come together to support both of these bills in order to hand down to our children and grandchildren a part of America's great natural legacy.

   Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise today to express my deep disappointment with the budget we are going to be voting on today. And while I applaud the efforts of the Republican leadership to have a budget resolution, I believe that in the haste to get something out by April, we have put together a budget that really lacks any sense of fiscal responsibility. 
   Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this conference report. This report before us fails our families and it fails our children. This is the first budget for a new century, but it does very little to prepare us for the challenges we are going to face. It ignores key investments in education, health care, environmental protection, and child care. Regrettably, it ignores our obligation to current retirees and those who will retire within the next 20 years. 
   Mr. President, I have listened to many of my colleagues who talk about returning the people's money to the people, and I could not agree more. We should allocate part of the surplus to saving Social Security and Medicare. Hard-working Americans have paid their FICA and Medicare payroll taxes with the understanding that when they reach the age of 65, or become disabled, they will be guaranteed Social Security benefits and Medicare. Social Security and Medicare allow the elderly independence and dignity in the years spent after a lifetime of work. We must reserve part of today's surplus to honor this commitment, and this budget does not do that. 
   We all know that Medicare is in real crisis. Yet, the only recommendations this budget offers are vague statements about reform. There is no talk about investing in prevention benefits that ultimately will save Medicare dollars. There is no language to improve the program so that senior citizens and the disabled can take advantage of new advances in biomedical research to improve the quality of their lives and their health. The priority of this budget before us appears to be to simply raid the Federal Treasury for an across-the-board tax cut. 
   We need to follow the example of working families. We have a budget surplus for the first time in decades because of tough fiscal discipline and wise economic investment. Just like families, we tightened our belt and restored fiscal soundness to the Federal Government. We should now use this surplus to save for and invest in the future. These are simple choices: Invest in our children and save for our retirement. That is the goal of most families. 
   I also point out to my colleagues the unfortunate fact that the conferees, in the middle of the night, behind closed doors, stripped out important language we had passed in the Senate regarding women and Social Security. Based on my reading of the conference report, it appears that my language was dropped. At the end of the report, there is a listing of all sense-of-the-Senate amendments adopted during consideration of the budget, but there is no explanation from the managers as to the status of these amendments. In addition, these amendments are clearly not part of the conference report pending before us. 
   Mr. President, an amendment I offered in committee and on the floor put every Senator on the record as being committed to protecting the safety net for women and making real change, to pull more older women out of poverty as we move forward with Social Security reform. My amendments were aimed at expressing our support of maintaining a guaranteed inflation-protected benefit for women and working to reform benefit calculations for Social Security. The amendment I offered on the floor made it clear that, through the process of Social Security reform, we would recognize the sacrifices women make to take care of their families. 
   I was proud to offer these amendments and had hoped that instead of just talking about taking care of women in the course of Social Security reform, there would be a solid, bipartisan commitment to addressing the unique economic situation faced by most women today. But it seems that, once again, the needs of women have been ignored or forgotten. With no women on the Senate Finance Committee, I wanted a strong statement from the Senate that the real interest of women who depend on Social Security would not be negotiated away. I wanted to be sure that all Members understood the changing dynamics of the workforce and the difficult choices women must make every single day.  
   Women make decisions in their thirties and forties for the welfare of their families, like raising children, only to find out in their sixties and seventies that this sacrifice has cost them their economic security in old age. A surviving spouse can also face a dramatic change in her standard of living immediately following the loss of her husband. 
   Women, on the average, give 11 and a half years of their working lives to their families. They jeopardize their long-term economic security and retirement income to meet the immediate needs of children or aging parents. A surviving spouse can see a reduction of as much as 50 percent of her Social Security income following the death of her husband. Is this the reward women deserve for caring for their families? Social Security reform gives us the chance to make things right for working women and protect their guaranteed benefit. We owe this to all families. 
   Unfortunately, when given the chance to assure women that their interests and real economic situation would not be forgotten, it would appear that the Republicans have now turned their backs. The failure to include my amendments will only make me work harder to educate women and to fight for women during the debate on Social Security reform. 
   I will not let the administration or Members of the Senate off the hook. There is no greater threat to women and families than a Social Security reform proposal that ignores the economic disadvantages still faced by working women and older women. I hope that all working women and older women are watching the debate on Social Security reform and taking note. 
   Mr. President, I also want to say again how disappointed I am in this budget process. When I decided to serve on the Budget Committee, I wanted to return some common sense to our fiscal policy. I wanted to bring the voice of working families to the table, and I don't think this budget passes the test. It is seriously flawed when it comes to the issue of education. 
   When I talk to my constituents about education and the efforts of Congress, most people are very surprised and angered to learn that less than 2 percent of overall Federal spending goes to education. 
   They think education should be a higher priority, that we should improve and increase education spending, and so do I. 
   Instead, other than an increase for the Individuals with Disabilities in Education Act--an important $500 million increase that I think we all support--we will see cuts in education funding, and cuts in other important areas in social services and job training. 
   Even with the increase for IDEA, this budget agreement assumes $200 million in other funds--or $700 million if IDEA is included--in cuts below a freeze that would have to come from other discretionary programs in education, social services and job training. 
   Where will the axe fall? The Senate's budget specifically focused on subfunction 501--K-12 education. But after working with the House, this conference proposal now is silent on K-12 education as a specific subfunction. Can we then assume that our public schools will bear the burden of these cuts? Or will the cuts be in other important areas? The list is long. Will it be Head Start or national service, job training or juvenile justice, student aid or nutritional programs? 
   The American people in overwhelming numbers support increased funding for education. The Congress of the United States has not yet heard the message. This budget conference agreement does not place education as a high enough priority. Among other things, this budget completely ignores the pressing need to continue in the national effort to help local school districts hire 100,000 new, well-qualified teachers. 
   In the classroom, when students wonder why their teacher is not prepared to help them learn math and science--they can look to this budget. When they are stuck in an over-crowded classroom, they can look to this budget. When they learn that there will be less student aid this year than last year, they can look to this budget. When the American people see that fewer children are graduating with the skills they need to participate in our fast-changing economy, they can look to this budget and the short-sighted priorities of the 106th Congress. 
   A small bright spot in this otherwise bleak budget is the important expansion to child care funding. The Senate overwhelmingly supported the Dodd child care amendment to the budget resolution. I cosponsored that amendment, and while only part of it was retained, I think we have the beginnings of real, bipartisan progress on child care funding. 
   What the Senate supported yesterday in an overwhelming 66-33 vote, was a historic first step that would have increased child care funding by $12.5 billion over 10 years--nearly doubling our federal investment in quality child care. 
   What the Senate is being asked to support today is not the complete Dodd amendment, but with a $3 billion investment in the child care and development block grant, and $3 billion in tax incentives, we are making a good start. 
   Child care questions are becoming more and more pressing for more parents every day. With concerns about affordability, quality, and access--and with more low-income parents going into the workforce--the needs are changing and increasing. More child care is needed during ``off hours''--such as evenings and weekends. More child care is needed in rural settings, impacting transportation, work schedules, and the amount of licensed family child care providers. 
   It is vital that we make improvements for child care; the provisions of this conference agreement are a beginning to real progress. 
   But Mr. President, the glimmer of hope offered by the language on childcare is not enough reason to support the FY2000 Budget before us and I urge a no vote on the Conference Report. Under the unrealistic limits set under this budget, as a member of the Appropriations Committee, I know we will be unable to protect the real concerns of working families. Our hands will be tied when it comes time for us to invest in important priorities like education, health care, environmental protection, agriculture, biomedical research, and early childhood development. 
   Mr. President, finally, I commend Senator LAUTENBERG for his leadership in attempting to work for real progress and for a true fiscal plan that will guide us in the new millennium. I know he shares my disappointment in this resolution. But I thank him for the tremendous amount of work and leadership he has given us on the Budget Committee as we move forward. 
   Thank you, Mr. President. 
   Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum, and I ask that it be equally divided.

   Mrs. MURRAY. Thank you, Mr. President. 
   Mr. President, before the body at this time is an amendment on education. We have heard from this floor many times over the course of this Congress that education is a priority. And that is a fact; it is a priority here in the Senate. I am delighted to say that. It is certainly a priority for thousands of families across the country who have children in school who want them to get a good education. But it is also a priority for many businesses who want to make sure that we are educating young people today in order to give them the skills they need to be able to hire them. It is a priority for our police officers and the community leaders, because they know that investing in education and making sure that young people get what they need in our  schools means the safety, the health, and the viability of our country for many years to come. 
   The pending amendment talks about education. But talking about education is not what our constituents are asking for. They are asking for us to invest in education. We can all talk about quality, but unless we provide the resources for those schools out there, we will not be providing them with the kind of education they have to have in order for our country to be strong in the future. The amendment that my colleagues, Senator KENNEDY and Senator DODD, have introduced offers us a way to do that. 
   Too often on this floor we have set up challenges between different funding. We can either support IDEA funding for special education, or we can support teacher quality, or class size. The amendment that Senator KENNEDY will offer at a later time provides us with the alternative to make sure that we do provide the funds for special education under IDEA and complete the promise we have made to young students and teachers and communities to reduce class size. It simply says that this is an investment we are going to make. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. It will make a difference in our classrooms across this country. 
   Mr. President, too often we are told that we are providing a tax cut and returning money to the people. I can think of no better way to return money to our constituents than by investing it in education so that our young people get the skills they need, so they can get jobs and become a viable part of our 
   economy in the future. A budget is not just about putting dollars out there today, it is making good investment so that our budgets will be strong in the future. 
   That is why I am going to support the Kennedy amendment, which gives actual real resources to our students, and not just another empty promise and another way of moving bureaucratic paper around. 
   Thank you, Mr. President. I yield my time back to the Senator from Massachusetts.

   Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to establish the Hanford Reach of the Columbia River as a Wild and Scenic River. Simply stated, this is the best, most cost-effective, and smartest way to protect the Northwest's dwindling wild salmon runs. 
   The Hanford Reach is an extraordinary and unique place. 
   While most of the Columbia River Basin was being developed during the middle of this century, the Hanford Reach and other buffer areas within the Hanford Nuclear Reservation were kept pristine, ironically, by the same veil of secrecy and security that lead to the notorious nuclear and chemical contamination of the central Hanford Site. Today, these relatively undisturbed areas are the last wild remnants of a great river and vast ecological community that have been tamed by dams, farms, and other development elsewhere. 
   As the last free-flowing stretch of the Columbia River, the significance of the Hanford Reach cannot be overstated. Mile for mile, it contains some of the most productive and important fish spawning habitat in the lower 48 states. The volume and velocity of the cool, clear waters of the Columbia River produce ideal conditions for spawning and migrating salmon. The Reach produces eighty percent of the Columbia Basin's fall chinook salmon, as well as thriving runs of steelhead trout and sturgeon. It is the only truly healthy segment of the mainstem of the Columbia River. 
   The Reach is also rich in other natural and cultural resources. Bald eagles, wintering and migrating waterfowl, deer, elk, and a diversity of other wildlife depend on the Reach. It is home to dozens of rare, threatened, and endangered plants and animals, some found only in the Reach. Native American culture thrived on the shores and islands of the Reach for millennia, and there are over 150 archeological sites in the proposed designation, some dating back more than 10,000 years. The Reach's naturally spawning salmon and cultural sites remain a vital part of the culture and religion of Native American groups in the area. 
   It is remarkable that the Reach offers so much in such close proximity to the cities of Kennewick, Pasco, and Richland, Washington. The Reach offers residents and visitors recreation of many types--from hunting, fishing, and hiking to kayaking, waterskiing, and birdwatching--and adds greatly to the quality of life and economy of the area. 
   Back in 1994, only the locals in and around the Tri-Cities had heard about the last-free flowing stretch of the mighty Columbia River. Several residents had been working more than  thirty years to save the Reach and they got me involved to do the same. They showed me what a precious resource the Hanford Reach is, and I promised to do everything in my power to protect it. 
   I convened a Hanford Reach Advisory Panel to develop a consensus plan to protect the river corridor. Their work has been the basis of the bills I have introduced in the past and that I am introducing today, and builds on the foundation begun by Senators Dan Evans and Brock Adams, and Congressman Sid Morrison who enacted legislation imposing a moratorium on development within the river corridor in 1987. 
   I am confident this is the year we will finally achieve our goals and create a new Wild and Scenic River. We cannot wait any longer to save the Reach. Since the recent listing of the Puget Sound chinook, everyone across the Northwest is focused on what we all must do to save our wild salmon. 
   Designating the Hanford Reach as a Wild and Scenic River is the simplest and most effective way to provide real, permanent protection for our wild salmon stocks. Only under the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act will we get the expertise, resources and permanency that federal management agencies, like the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, provide. The Wild and Scenic Rivers Act is recognized as the best way to protect endangered rivers across the nation. The Reach deserves no less than the best. 
   And this designation will not cost a penny. The land surrounding the river is already publicly held. The Department of Energy owns land on both sides of the river, so no private lands will be acquired or taken out of production to save this special place. 
   In addition to public ownership, this section of the river is in superb ecological condition. It offers the best salmon spawning grounds on the mainstem of the Columbia. It will not require the millions of dollars for remediation that we've spent on other rivers and streams across the country. All the Hanford Reach requires is our protection, and it will continue to produce salmon runs unsurpassed anyplace in the region. 
   Creating a Wild and Scenic River will help us avoid drastic measures like breaching the dams along the Columbia and Snake River systems to restore salmon. The recent Endangered Species Act listing of nine more northwest salmon runs as threatened, is another indication that we must take immediate action. Protecting the Reach is an insurance policy against the future possibility of expensive clean-up efforts and lawsuits. We must make this investment now to demonstrate we're serious about protecting not only wild salmon, but also the economic and social structure in the inland West. 
   This bill differs from my previous legislation in some important ways. Not only does it create a federally-designated recreational Wild and Scenic River, it also establishes an innovative management approach through the creation of a multi-party commission. The management commission will develop a plan to guide the US Fish and Wildlife Service and will be comprised of three federal representatives from the Departments of Energy, Interior, and Commerce (National Marine Fisheries Service); three Washington state representatives from the Departments of Fish and Wildlife, Ecology, and Community, Trade and Economic Development; three representatives of local government from the counties of Benton, Grant, and Franklin; three tribal representatives from the Yakama, Umatilla, and Nez Perce peoples; and three local citizen representatives from conservation, recreation, and business interests. 
   This bill also takes us a step closer to consolidating lands on the Hanford reservation itself in order to facilitate economic development, preservation of sacred tribal sites, and protection of important biological resources. It requires the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and the Department of Energy to examine the best ways to consolidate BLM lands on the south side of the river on the Hanford site. It establishes the objectives of the study to clear title to lands along the railroad and in the 200 Area for industrial development; to protect wildlife and native plants; and to preserve cultural sites important to Native Americans. 
   This bill does not address the critical and sensitive lands of the North Slope (also known as the Wahluke Slope) because the land is still needed by the Department of Energy for safety reasons. However, I hope to work through the administrative process to ensure these lands are not disturbed in any way that could possibly impact the healthy salmon spawning grounds below the White Bluffs. I remain committed to enlarging the existing Saddle Mountain National Wildlife Refuge because, again, I am convinced we must provide the strongest, surest protection for the North Slope to offer our wild salmon their best hope for survival. 
   At a time when the Pacific Northwest is spending hundreds of millions of dollars annually on restoration and enhancement efforts, and struggling to restore declining salmon runs, protecting the Hanford Reach is the most cost-effective measure we can take. That is why the Northwest Power Planning Council, Trout Unlimited, conservation groups, tribes, and many other regional interests involved in the salmon controversy all support designation of the Reach under the National Wild and Scenic Rivers Act. 
   These are some of the many good reasons for this Congress to take up and pass this legislation to ensure the Hanford Reach becomes a part of the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System. I urge the other members of Congress to join us in demanding the permanent protection of this river. It has given us so very much. The least we can do for the Columbia River is to protect the last fifty-one miles of free-flowing waters and the wild salmon that call it home.

   Mrs. MURRAY. I thank my colleague from New Jersey, the ranking member on the Budget Committee, who has worked with us for a number of years in putting together these budgets. I join my colleagues in wishing him well on his retirement and thank him for the work he has done for so many people throughout his career. 
   Mr. President, I rise today to express my strong opposition to the pending fiscal year 2000 budget resolution that is before us here today and my deep concern and disappointment with the priorities that have been laid out in this budget. I remind my colleagues that budgets are not about today; they are about tomorrow. Failure to establish a framework for Federal spending that focuses on the future is a serious mistake. 
   Last week during the consideration of the resolution in the Budget Committee, I was really amazed at our lack of focus on investing in our future and our complete disregard for the impact of the decisions we were making on hard-working families. The mistake that we all made during committee consideration was our failure to put a human face on our discussions. We simply lost sight of the human and social costs of our decisions. 
   The focus of this budget that is before us and the focus of the debate in committee seemed to be based solely on politically expedient tax cuts. There was no discussion on extending the solvency of Social Security or Medicare and what our failure to address these issues will mean for working families. There was no attempt to address the shortfalls in our investment in public education, our public health, environment, veterans health care, child care, food safety, Older Americans Act, Medicare, Medicaid. These are not just spending programs, these are investments in our quality of life and in our future economic security. 
   When we talk about education, a lot of the talk we hear on the floor is jargon--jargon--about flexibility and block grants and Federal mandates. No one talks about walking into a classroom of 40 young children and looking into their faces as they struggle to learn. I cannot say strongly enough, there are human costs to the decisions that we are making in this budget. 
   I have talked to children our decisions affect. I have talked to their teachers and their parents. I know they are not interested in political 
   double-talk. What they want to know is, What are we doing to prepare them for the challenges of the next century? What are we doing to invest in our young children so that they have the ability to get a job when they graduate? Are we addressing the huge class sizes that our children face every day and their inability to learn math and reading and science? Are we addressing the issue of the crumbling schools that many of our children go to every day? Are we addressing the fact that our teachers need to be educated and trained to be able to teach the skills that we require of them today? 
   That is what parents and students and communities and business leaders are looking for in this budget. That is what we have failed to address. 
   I see the same lack of focus in dealing with Medicare. I am glad there is a bipartisan agreement to protect the Social Security trust fund. That one step alone will do a lot to restore integrity to the program and return confidence to the Social Security system. However, I am very troubled by the lack of commitment to Medicare. 
   In reviewing the committee's report to accommodate the resolution, the priority appears to be one thing, and that is tax cuts. The resolution assumes tax cuts totaling almost $700 billion over 10 years but very little mention of how we are going to invest the surplus in providing equal, affordable health care for our Nation's senior citizens. Again, this resolution places a higher priority on compensation as opposed to investment. 
   I want to know how we are going to explain to an 83-year-old widow that Congress has decided that a tax cut is more important than providing her with quality, affordable health care. 
   The fastest growing segment of our population living in poverty is those over the age of 65. All of the investments we have made, from Social Security to Medicare to the Older Americans Act, that have ensured a quality standard of living for those over 65, are jeopardized by a simple fact, and that simple fact is that the population over 65 is increasing faster than we are ready for. We have an opportunity, with the surplus in front of us, to invest a portion of that into Medicare in order to extend the solvency without making devastating and dangerous cuts. 
   Reform of Medicare must be carefully considered and executed. We cannot change the program overnight without harmful implications. The budget resolution we are dealing with here today fails to address the immediate and long-term problems of Medicare, and, once again, there is no discussion of the human cost of the decisions we are making. 
   I have spoken with that 83-year-old widow who sometimes has to choose between hundreds of dollars a year in prescription drugs and food. How do I explain that, under this, she could face an additional $2,498 a year in Medicare premiums? How do you justify increasing the burden on individuals whose average income is slightly less than $13,000 a year? 
   I ask my colleagues to stop and reconsider their priorities. I have heard some of my colleagues talking about the need to return the ``people's money'' to the people. Well, I agree. Families have worked hard and paid their taxes with the belief that Medicare would provide for their parents as well as themselves when they retire. Medicare allows the elderly independence and dignity in the final years of their lives. I 
   believe investing the surplus into Medicare is returning the people's money to the people. 
   As I stated earlier, I am pleased that there is a bipartisan commitment to save the Social Security trust fund surplus. This will allow greater flexibility in reforming the system and improving current benefits. And I was pleased with the bipartisan support for the amendment I offered in committee regarding the impact of Social Security reform on women. 
   Up until now, the only discussion about women and Social Security reform has been very vague statements about ``taking care'' of them. I believe that very few understand the unique circumstances of women who, throughout their working life and in retirement, face very different decisions and circumstances, where women tend to be out of the workforce to raise their children, or later on in life to take care of elderly parents, where women earn, on the average, 75 cents on the dollar of what men do; when we look at Social Security reform and realize right now that Social Security is based on the top 35 years of income, and for many women who do not work 35 years, their income is averaged by adding a number of zeros into that calculation because they have not worked those years. 
   We have to use this opportunity to make sure that how these decisions are made does not negatively impact women. It is actually this lack of understanding of women in the workforce that has resulted in many more women who are living in poverty today after the age of 65. Single older women are more than twice as likely as men to face poverty today. 
   The bipartisan support of my amendment in committee has encouraged me to offer an amendment to the pending resolution which I hope my colleagues will again support. We have to use reform and this added financial flexibility to address the specific shortfalls in the current structure that penalize women and oftentimes leave them in poverty following the death of their spouse. 
   My amendment would simply illustrate the support of the Senate for using reform as a mechanism, not just at protecting the status quo but actually improving the economic security of older women. I hope that the same commitment to address the needs of women in reform prevails when I offer  this amendment in the next several days. 
   Finally, Mr. President, I want to caution my colleagues about the dangers we face when fiscal policy development breaks down into partisan politics. We will not be successful unless we have a bipartisan effort. I urge my colleagues to think carefully about the constituents they have met and the people who have come to them asking them for help and support. 
   We need to stay focused on these faces and remember that the budget is not just about economic or policy decisions but about decisions with real consequences and real human costs. 
   I am hopeful that as this budget process continues we can redirect our efforts and shift our priorities from short-term diversions to savings and investing in the future. We have made the tough decisions that have given us a budget surplus today. Like every family, we cut back and for several years maintained strict fiscal discipline. Let's follow the example of many families and use our surplus to invest and save--not to rush out to spend on lavish vacations or luxury items. Let's use basic common sense in deciding on the priorities of the first budget of the millennium.

   Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, we have a difficult decision before us. I believe most, if not all of us, hope the states will do the right thing and spend the tobacco litigation money to stop underage smoking, reduce adult smoking, and provide critical public health services. I know I am unequivocally committed to those objectives and will  therefore support the Specter-Harkin amendment to ensure they do so. 
   That said, I want the states to have the greatest degree of flexibility and discretion in allocating these settlement funds to the health needs of their residents as possible. This amendment does just that. It broadly requires states to spend 20 percent of the settlement on programs to reduce the use of tobacco products, including enforcement, school education programs, and advertising campaigns. It also requires 30 percent to be spent on public health. 
   If we do not reduce smoking and stop at least some of the 3,000 new kids per day from smoking, the federal taxpayer will end up the loser. That is why we should have a voice in directing use of these funds. The Medicare Trust Fund is financially solvent only until 2009, so we need to do everything possible to reduce overall health care costs. If one state does not reduce the deadly impact of smoking, the federal taxpayers will foot the bill. So, all American taxpayers have a big stake in reducing smoking. They have the right to push all states to save their tax dollars by reducing health care costs. 
   Still, the Specter-Harkin amendment targets only a portion of settlement dollars; just that portion that could be attributed to the federal share of Medicaid. Because Medicaid is a federal-state partnership and the settlement includes claims arising out of this program, federal taxpayers have a valid claim to make in how those settlement dollars are spent. 
   I am proud of my home state of Washington. It has already made a commitment to public health and smoking reduction. The Specter-Harkin amendment only reinforces what my state has done. Once again Washington state is a leader on protecting public health and saving the premature death of five million of today's children. I have attached a letter I received from the Western Pacific Division of the American Cancer Society urging me to support this amendment for these very reasons, to support the ``health of our kids and our families.'' 
   I also continue to support Senator HUTCHINSON's work to ensure the states receive the credit they deserve. They have scored a major victory for public health. The success of the Attorney's General in their settlement with the tobacco companies is unprecedented. I applaud them and especially Washington's Attorney General, Chris Gregoire, who has been a champion in this cause. 
   The federal government must not rely on the states to do all of its work for them. It is the responsibility of the federal government to recover Medicaid funds and I will urge the Administration to move forward with necessary litigation. The federal government must seek restitution from the tobacco companies for the years of lies and deception that have resulted in the premature deaths of millions of Americans. Smoking-related illnesses are still the number-one killer of Americans. 
   I am pleased Senators SPECTER and HARKIN could find the appropriate balance between the rights of the states to enjoy their well-deserved settlement funds and the rights of federal taxpayers to ensure those funds are spent to protect the public health and reduce their future tax obligations under Medicare and Medicaid by reducing the cost of tobacco-related illnesses.

    Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, it is my pleasure to rise today to congratulate Ms. Nora Hill of Yakima, Washington, who celebrated her 108th birthday on February 1, 1999. 
   Nora Maddie Wilson was born on February 1, 1891 in Benton County, Arkansas and is the youngest of twelve children. Nora never had a formal education, but was educated by her older brothers and sisters. She loved to read and had beautiful penmanship. Nora was also an avid quilter, making extra money by making quilts for other people. In 1911, Nora married John Bunyon Hill and had four children. In 1940 her family moved to the Yakima Valley in Washington state. Nora could handle a team of horses and a wagon with the best of them, however, she never wanted to learn how to drive an automobile, as it made her too nervous. 
   Nora is a survivor of cancer at the age of 99 and a broken hip at the age of 104. Both of Nora's sons, who served in World War II, have since passed away. Her daughters are still living. Nora has over sixty grand, great grand, great-great grand and great-great-great grand children. 
   Please all join me in wishing Ms. Nora Hill of Yakima, Washington a very happy 108th year.

    Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, it is my great pleasure to recognize Ms. Hazel Wolf of Seattle, Washington, in honor of her 101st birthday on Wednesday, March 10, 1999. Ms. Wolf, a great, great grand-mother, is a tireless advocate for conservation, environmental protection and social justice throughout the Pacific Northwest. A dedicated volunteer, community activist and leader, Ms. Wolf serves as an outstanding example for all Americans. 
   Ms. Wolf became involved in the Audubon Society in the early-1960s and had a hand in starting 21 of the 26 Audubon Society chapters in Washington State, plus one in her birthplace of Victoria, British Columbia. In 1979, she worked to organize the first statewide conference to bring together environmentalists and Native American tribes. For three decades she has served as Secretary of the Seattle Audubon Society chapter, and for 17 years she has edited an environmental newsletter, ``Outdoors West''. In addition, she is among the founders of Seattle's Community Coalition for Environmental Justice. She is a frequent speaker at schools and environmental conferences throughout the Northwest. 
   In 1997, the National Audubon Society awarded her the prestigious Medal of Excellence. The Seattle Audubon chapter has created the Hazel Wolf ``Kids for the Environment'' endowment, which will help educate youth about conservation. Ms. Wolf is also the recipient of the 1997 Chevron Conservation Award, the $2,000 prize from which she contributed to the Seattle Audubon Society. In Issaquah, Washington, there is a 116-acre wetland named after her and on the other side of the Cascade Mountains near Yakima, a bird sanctuary bears her name. 
   Hazel Wolf retired from her career as a legal secretary in 1965. She has proven repeatedly that significant and lasting contributions to society are a function neither of career nor of age, but of hard work, perseverance and vision. As her family and friends gather to celebrate her 101st birthday, I want to wish Ms. Wolf continued success and good health, and to thank her for being an inspiration to me and countless others. Happy Birthday, Hazel.

   Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, in a short while we will begin the debate again on the Ed-Flex bill that has been on the floor for the last several weeks. It is a bipartisan bill. Democrats and Republicans alike are supporting this bill. It is a simple bill, essentially, that will allow some of our school districts to be more flexible with their education dollars; for the liability for some of the waivers to be transferred from the Department of Education directly to the Governors, so the Governors in our States can provide some of the waivers based on some specific clauses that are in the bill. Essentially, it is a matter of paperwork being moved from the Nation's Capital to the Governors' desks. It is a bill, again, that is supported broadly. 
   I have come to the floor numerous times over the last week to talk about an amendment which I hope to offer today regarding class size reduction. A year ago, the President talked about the most important goal in education, one of the most important goals we have--that of reducing class size in grades 1 through 3. Studies have shown us consistently that reducing class size in those grades makes a tremendous difference in the learning of young children--in their math, reading, language scores, and in their ability to go on to college. It improves discipline problems, as shown by numerous studies that I, again, hope to be able to talk about once my amendment comes to the floor. 
   We talked about this amendment all last year during the 
   session. Then, in a bipartisan bill last October, in the budget process we passed the beginning phase of reducing class size and began a commitment to this country that we would help our schools across this country begin to reduce class sizes in grades 1 through 3, where it makes a difference. It was a bipartisan effort last year. It should be a bipartisan effort this year. 
   This is a critical issue right now in this country, today, where school boards across our country are looking for whether or not we just made some kind of political offering last October, right before the elections, or whether we really meant it when we said we were going to join with our schools across this country in this commitment to reduce class size. 
   It is extremely timely that this Senate go on record right now with a commitment to our school districts, to let them know that we are there for them, that this wasn't just a fly-by-night political operation in October, it was a commitment from us at the Federal level to work hand in hand with schools across this country to begin to reduce class size. My amendment will authorize this program for the next 6 years. It is extremely important, because our school boards right now are putting their budgets together. They are determining what kind of money they will have. 
   They want to know, is this real or is this not, because they begin right now the process of hiring teachers to begin next fall. They do not want to hire a teacher, find out we did not really mean it last October, and make that commitment. They want to know whether we stand there ready, confirmed, and committed to this process. That is why it is so critical that we go on the record now with the class size authorization bill. 
   I hope to offer that today. I am looking forward to working with my Republican colleagues, again, in a bipartisan effort to let our school boards know we are with them in this critical process. We will obviously have other times to talk about this, certainly in the appropriations committees, as we did last year. I know we will have a big discussion on it in the budget. It is extremely important that we make this kind of commitment now. 
   I have heard my colleagues from the Republican side say that Ed-Flex needs to go cleanly right now, because it is bipartisan and because it is timely. The same goes for class size reduction. It is timely, so school boards can make those commitments, and it is bipartisan, if we all believed what we said and how we voted last October. 
   I really hope I can work with my Republican colleagues to, again, put this amendment up this afternoon or whenever the majority leader agrees, have a time commitment to it. I am willing to negotiate that. If it can be done quickly, that is fine by me. We need to have an up-or-down vote on this amendment, and we need to do it as quickly as possible. 
   I, too, want the Ed-Flex bill to pass. This is an amendment I think is critical and important and timely, and I hope to work with my Republican colleagues to make sure it happens today. I am looking forward to our discussion, which will begin in about a half hour. I hope to offer my amendment and to work with all of our colleagues on the floor to send a message that we do believe in this U.S. Senate that reducing class size in 1 through 3 is a commitment we can and should make.

<TEXT>
   Mrs. MURRAY. Thank you. Madam President, let me just commend the Senator from Massachusetts for his tremendous work on the education issue and for his repeated help with those of us who would like to offer amendments that would make a difference for young children in this country--in their education and in our responsibilities to live up to promises we made to our voters to deal with the issues of education, whether it is reducing class size; training our teachers; dropout prevention, as Senator BINGAMAN has brought to us; afterschool care, as Senator BOXER has talked about; and numerous other issues that will affect children's education. 
   I listened to the chairman this morning as he talked about my amendment, which has yet to be offered, on class size. I agree with him that the best thing we can do for our kids in our classes is to have a quality teacher. That is exactly what this amendment that we would like to offer does. 
   Reducing class size allows 15 percent of the funds to go to recruiting, hiring, and training certified, regular, and special education teachers, and teachers of special needs children, including teachers certified with State and local governments. 
   I am reading from my amendment, Madam President. This amendment makes sure that the teachers who are put into our classrooms are well qualified. In fact, I worked with Senator JEFFORDS, chairman of the committee, last year, along with our ranking member, in order to deal with the issue of quality teachers. We passed an agreement last year that began to make sure that our young people out in the colleges today who are learning to be teachers are given skills in technology, a very important issue, making sure that every new teacher who is certified from here on out has training in technology. We intend to work with the chairman of the committee when we reauthorize the ESEA, to make sure that our teachers who are out there are already getting the training and help they need so they can be the best teachers possible. 
   But it isn't good enough to just have a teacher in the classroom. We need to make sure that those teachers have enough time with individual students to help them with their reading skills, to help them with their math skills, to help them with their introduction to science, to help them with their writing skills. There is nothing more frustrating to a first-grade teacher who is trying to help the young student in her classroom learn to read, and one young student can't get the time and individual attention he or she needs so that they can break through the barrier and learn to read. And there is nothing worse than for a teacher to go home at night and be completely frustrated because they had 30, 35 kids in their classroom and they weren't able to help one child. There is nothing more difficult for a teacher than to recognize that they left the child behind that day or that night or that year because they didn't have the individual attention they needed. 
   We go out to our communities--all of us--and we talk to business leaders in our communities. Every one of them tells us that they want to hire kids from their local schools to go into their businesses. They look directly at us, and they say, ``We want to know when those kids graduate from high school that they know how to read, write, that they have the basics in science and math.'' What we have found from all of the studies we have seen is that when class sizes are reduced in the first through third grades, those students go on through high school and they graduate with competency in those requirements. It does make a difference. 
   Madam President, last year I introduced legislation on reducing class size. It was turned down on a partisan vote in the beginning of the year. But we did have a bipartisan agreement. We changed the language of my original bill to add training for teachers, because that is what my Republican colleagues wanted. We added language that included local alternative routes. That was directly in relation to the Republicans asking us to put this in the amendment. We worked the wording back and forth and, last October, agreed with Congressman GOODLING, Senator GORTON, Senator KENNEDY, and others who were in the negotiations, who were representing all of us in those negotiations, to come up with a bipartisan agreement. And it was passed in a bipartisan fashion. 
   It is now not only extremely timely but necessarily timely that we go back to those districts and tell them that this wasn't just a commitment from October; we are firmly committed to making sure that young children in our schools get the class size reduction that they need to have the ability to learn the skills they need so that we can make a real commitment to education. 
   Don't just look at me for this. I am a former teacher. I am a former school board member. I am a parent of two students who went through our public schools. I have been out there as a PTA member. I have been a State legislator dealing with education. And I have been on the committee here that deals with education. I have seen education from every angle--from being a teacher, a parent, a school board member, a legislator--and I can tell you that all of those groups, every one of them, know that when you reduce class size you make a difference in a child's learning. 
   We all agreed on that last October. We all agreed on that language. We said yes, this is a commitment that we need to make as a Federal Government. We looked at the bill and did everything we could, and brought our Republican colleagues into the discussions, so that there were no new reports, there was no additional paperwork, that the money went directly to our school districts so they could hire qualified teachers. We worked this through in a bipartisan fashion. 
   Today school boards are out there and they are calling my office--I am sure they are calling every office here--saying, ``We are putting our budget together for next year. We are beginning the hiring process to hire our teachers. Is this a commitment that is just a hollow promise, or are you going to follow through?'' Our amendment, a 6-year authorization, says we are going to follow through, that we didn't just do it last 
   October, that we meant it as a commitment, that we as a Congress know that class size reduction is absolutely critical. 
   Madam President, the President has made this a top priority. The Vice President issued a statement in support of it today. The administration is going to be there with us. We will get class size reduction. We all know that. We know we are debating an amendment now. But the school boards don't know that. They need a commitment now so they can put their budgets together and hire those teachers. 
   I was a school board member. I can tell you, we didn't deal with promises when I was a school board member. When you are putting the budgets together to hire these teachers, everybody loves you. But you don't want to be the school board member a year from now or 6 months from now who tells those teachers, ``We are going to fire you, let you go.'' They do not care if it was the Federal Government or not. They will come to your school board meeting saying, ``How can you fire our teachers?'' School board members can say, ``Well, the Federal Government didn't follow through on their  promise.'' But that doesn't make a difference when you are a school board member and you have to go to the grocery store the next day with all the parents who are going to be affected by a decision we made. 
   Madam President, we made a good, solid commitment. We worked a year, along with our Republican colleagues, to add their language to our proposal. That is what was agreed on last October. That is what we have in front of us today, if we are allowed to offer it. And that is a commitment that we ought to make to parents, to students, and to school boards who are doing their budgets, and to our Government, which is also counting on us to make sure that we have our commitments in order to our young children across this country. 
   Madam President, I have worked long and hard with my Republican colleagues on this issue. It is an extremely timely and necessary issue. We agree that the Ed-Flex bill is one that we can all agree on. But why not do what is really important in this country on this bill? Why should we be precluded from offering these amendments? If our Republican colleagues now don't agree with those on class size, fine; vote no. But let's let our school board members know. They have a right to know. We have an obligation to tell them. That is why we feel so strongly about offering this amendment. 
   Again, I offer to my Republican colleagues, we would like to work with you on this. We believe this is a commitment that was made last year that we should stand up to. The administration stands with us. Let's put the words in writing, and then we can go on to other issues. 
   I heard the chairman of the committee say, ``Well, let's wait until the ESEA is reauthorized.'' I have been here in the Senate for 6 and a half years. I know that reauthorizing a bill, bringing it here to the floor, and having it move forward is no guarantee. I know it could be a year from now. It may not happen. I have seen reauthorizations not agreed to. I want to make sure that our class size allocations don't get lost because we can't get a bill through the floor 6 months from now or 8 months from now. Again, our school boards are hiring teachers. They need to know now. They cannot wait. 
   I have studies, which I will go through when we get our amendment to the floor, which show that reducing class size makes a difference. I have many, many letters, and I have had phone calls from parents. I have heard from students. I have teachers who would like to have their words be put on the floor of the Senate in support of this proposal. I am hearing from them. I am sure many of our colleagues are as well. 
   This is an important and timely issue. I sincerely hope that our Republican colleagues will allow us to vote on it. I heard the chairman of the committee, the manager on the floor, talk about the fact that perhaps it would be agreed on now. I again urge you to allow us to vote on it. Let's have the debate. 
   I heard the chairman talk about the fact that he would second-degree my amendment with legislation to take all of the class size money that was allocated last year and give it to IDEA funding for special education children. 
   Madam President, I agree with the chairman of the committee, funding for IDEA is absolutely essential. I offered this amendment on the floor during the budget process last year to fund IDEA. I believe in that commitment. But let's not rob those schools of money that we promised them last October for this year to reduce class sizes in first through third grade and give it to IDEA. We can't pit student against student. What an empty promise, to anybody who depends on the future of education, if we come back 6 months later, after a bipartisan agreement has been reached, and say, ``Well, gee, sorry. Politics have changed. We are taking the money that we promised you and giving it to another group.'' 
   Madam President, kids in the first through third grade in school districts, whether they are in Shoreline, or Seattle, or Wanaque, Kentucky, Florida, or any other community, know that reducing class size makes a difference. Ask any parent how many times, when their child comes home on the first day of school--every parent--the first question is, ``How many kids are in your classroom?'' Every parent knows that if the class size is small enough--we are asking for 18 in first through third grade--their child is going to get a good education. If the answer is 32, as it was for a friend of mine just a few days ago in enrolling her child in kindergarten, you know your child is not going to get the help they need and deserve in this country today to get a good education. 
   Madam President, I will retain the remainder of our time. I am happy to hear what our Republican colleagues say. 
   But I again offer to them that I am more than willing to have a time agreement on my amendment and an up-or-down vote. I am more than willing to do it in an expeditious fashion. I am positive we could finish the bill in the next 24 hours. With a time agreement on my amendment and the other amendments that I am sure our leader, along with yours, can work out on the floor, we can finish this bill by tomorrow and have the whole bill done in a week. But it will allow us to let people in this country know that this is a commitment we have an obligation to keep. 
   Madam President, I retain the remainder of my time, and I look forward to the debate, and I again plead with our colleagues to allow us to offer these amendments. 
   Mr. GREGG addressed the Chair.

   Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, if I could take just a few minutes, the vote is going to occur here on cloture in a few short minutes. I have to say, I have listened to the debate over the past week, and we are coming to the last several minutes. We are going to be voting at 5 o'clock whether or not to have cloture on the Ed-Flex bill that is before us. If cloture is invoked, essentially what will happen is, all of the education amendments we have been talking about--class size reduction, dropout prevention, parent accountability that Senator REED of Rhode Island just talked about, afterschool care--we will be precluded from offering these amendments. 
   I have been out here for the last week ready to offer my amendment on reducing class size, willing to work with my Republican colleagues on a time agreement, willing to do what we needed to do in terms of any language that they would like to be amended or changed, but knowing that school boards across this country are waiting for us to make a decision on whether or not we are actually going to authorize reducing class size and make a firm commitment to putting 100,000 new, well-trained teachers in classrooms. 
   Madam President, I have to say that I am baffled as we come into the last several minutes before we vote on cloture. We worked very hard last year, last fall, as we put the budget agreement together, to put together a bipartisan agreement on class size, and we got that. Republicans and Democrats alike said yes, we are going to make a commitment to reduce class size in the first through third grade. We agree with what the studies show. We agree with what parents are asking us to do. We understand that it makes a difference in the learning of a child in the first, second, and third grade if they are in a class size that is reduced. We understand that their grades will be better as they get into high school. We understand that discipline problems will be reduced. We understand they will have a better and higher likelihood of going on to college. 
   We understand that as the Federal Government we need to reach out and be a part of the solution and give a commitment of dollars to those school districts to hire teachers. It was a bipartisan agreement. I am baffled today by my Republican colleagues who now no longer are supporting this. 
   Last fall I watched the campaign and elections, and, as did many in my State, I am sure, I watched the ads from the Republicans saying they support reduced class size. Madam President, this is our opportunity to vote to authorize this program and really say we are committed to doing this. It will make a difference. It is absolutely essential. It is important that we be a part of this. 
   Over the last 6 1/2 years that I have been here, I have listened to a number of my colleagues come to the floor to speak as ``a businessperson who has run a major million-dollar business.'' I have listened to my colleagues, who come here as former Governors or former attorneys general or former State legislators, talk about their experience in their fields. Madam President, I stand before you today as a former teacher. I can tell you that it makes a difference whether you have 18 students in your class or you have 24 or you have 30. It makes a difference whether or not you have the ability to take that one young boy or girl and help that child really get his or her alphabet down so that child can read later, or if you ignore that child and say, ``Gosh, I really would like to help, but I have 30 kids here and there are winners and losers.'' 
   Those young children you cannot help because your class size is too large still grow up. They go on to high school. They probably don't go on to college. They become failures at an early grade. 
   We have a responsibility. We actually have an ability right now to send a message to those little boys and girls, to young students, to teachers, that we are going to give them the attention they need in first, second and third grade. Our amendment authorizes a 6-year investment in helping school districts hire 100,000 well-trained teachers. If we follow through on this commitment I guarantee, as a former teacher, as a parent, as a school board member, that 12 years from now we will have  young boys and girls, young students, graduating from high school who will be competent in reading, writing and math, because they were in a class with a size we helped reduce today. 
   If we do not make that commitment, there will be kids who may not graduate from high school, may have discipline problems, will not go on to college. They will become a burden to all of us. They will not be able to get a job in the high-tech industries that are saying, we need highly skilled students who graduate. They will not be able to compete and go on to college. They will become economically disadvantaged, and the Senate will be here, 12 years from now, wondering how we, as a nation, are going to be able to afford to continue to help kids who we didn't help 12 years ago. 
   Madam President, we have an opportunity to vote on this amendment and on the amendments of several of my colleagues who have made very good, strong arguments about what we can do to make education better in this country; reducing class size, training teachers, school construction, afterschool programs--real issues that will help young students. We will have the opportunity to do that if the majority leader will only allow us to offer our amendments. 
   We should not be precluded on the floor of the U.S. Senate from offering our amendments. If our colleagues want to vote no, they can vote no. If they want to vote with us, they can vote with us. But no one should come to this floor and be told that you cannot present your amendment. 
   I am ready to go. I am ready to have a time agreement. I ask my colleagues to support us in opposing cloture, and I will be back again and again until I can make a difference with class size reduction. I yield the floor.

   Mrs. MURRAY. Thank you, Mr. President. 
   Let me thank the Senator from Massachusetts for his statement. He has been a strong supporter of education. He understands that on this issue of class size reduction, parents, families, community members, police, mayors, school board members have all stood behind us and said this will make a difference for young children's learning. 
   I remain baffled by the majority leader not allowing us to simply offer the amendment with an up-or-down vote. We are more than willing to have a time agreement, a short time agreement, and move this bill along. 
   We all know that Ed-Flex has been asked for by 50 Governors. Well, reducing class size has been asked for by thousands of parents. It has been bipartisan--maybe it is not anymore; it certainly was last fall--a bipartisan initiative to reduce class size. I still believe that is true. It is timely, again, as school boards are looking at those budgets. If we can come to an agreement that will allow us to have an up-or-down vote, I am happy to offer my amendment. I will stay tonight; I can be here tomorrow morning. 
   Let me conclude by saying it is frustrating to be told no and no and no time and time again when we want to offer an amendment. I am beginning to feel like one of those kids in one of those large classes who has been told by the teacher time and again, ``You have to wait.'' When that happens, you get frustrated, you start to think of other things to do. You can become a discipline problem. I don't want to be, but I will tell my colleagues that we want to offer this amendment, we want an up-or-down vote, and as long as we are told we can't move ahead with it, we will think of other things to do. 
   I yield the floor.

   I ask my colleague from Texas what his intent is on this amendment. I know we are expected to go to a vote shortly. There are a number of us here who did want to talk about education before a vote occurred. Do you intend to vote in the next several minutes without yielding any Democratic time?

   Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I commend my colleague for his work on the  Ed-Flex bill as well as the other cosponsors of this initiative. I know he feels passionately about bureaucratic paperwork and has worked very hard to try to reduce some of that, as well as Education Secretary Riley, who has made a major effort in his tenure at the Department to reduce paperwork. We have heard some really good stories in the last year back from him. 
   We agree with you on Ed-Flex and want to move that forward. I think the Democratic leader this morning, offering to come up with limited amendments and limited time agreements, made a very generous offer, because there are a number of Senators, I think on both sides of the aisle, who want to spend some time talking about education, talking about what is happening in our schools, talking about our responsibility as Senators to be in partnership with those local schools and teachers and school board members; making sure that our kids, no matter who they are 
   or where they come from or how much money they have, have the best education possible. That is the debate we want to have on the floor of the Senate. 
   I am extremely disappointed because I came over here this morning, hoping to offer my class size amendment. I have been precluded from doing that by the actions of the majority leader. I am ready to offer my amendment so we can send a message to those school board members who are meeting right now, today, trying to figure out their budgets, who last October listened to us tell them in a bipartisan way, Republicans and Democrats, Senate and House Members, that we are committed to helping them reduce class size so our kids can get the adequate learning they need to compete in today's global economy. 
   But we are here today, once again precluded from being able to offer that amendment, to have a debate, to have an up-or-down vote, so those school board members can put their budgets together and begin to hire those teachers, as they must shortly do, so they can have a commitment that is real. 
   Let's tell them this was not a political promise before the election by Republicans and Democrats. This was a real commitment on our part to make a difference, to reduce class size in grades 1 through 3. We began that process last year. We have an obligation, and this is our opportunity to make a real difference.

   Mrs. MURRAY. The Senator from Massachusetts is absolutely correct. When we passed this last October, Republicans and Democrats stood up, stood together, and said: This is a commitment from the Federal Government. No additional redtape, no bureaucracy, the money is going to go out there to those local schools to hire teachers to reduce class size. We stood together, shoulder to shoulder. 
   I am having a difficult time going home now, talking to school board members and my friends who are teachers--many of whom are Republicans--and saying, well, gee, now maybe they might not support us. 
   They don't understand that because they are putting together a budget right now. They need to hire those teachers. They need to make a commitment to that teacher, to that class, to those parents who are enrolling their kids, that they are going to continue to do this. They need us in that partnership. They don't want political maneuvers. They don't understand why Ed-Flex is a bill we can't do this on. We are talking about education. The time is right. It was bipartisan before. They want us to give that commitment now, and that is why I came to the floor today to offer this amendment.

   Mrs. MURRAY. I thank my colleague from California for her tremendous work on education, her passion, and in particular, her afterschool programs and appreciate her remarks this morning and agree with her. Education is absolutely the No. 1 priority for families across this country, but it is not just families. We go and talk to businesses, and business people tell us we need to be able to hire students out of our schools with math and science and reading and English skills. Studies show--and I will be delighted, when we get to the debate on this, to go through the studies again--that reducing class size makes a difference in a child's ability to learn to write and to read, to do math and to do science, just the skills our businesses are looking for. They are looking to us to make a commitment on this. 
   I commend my colleague from Oregon, as well, for his work on this. I know he is committed to this issue and has pledged his support as well. He knows, too, how important class size is. 
   Let me end by reminding my colleagues this is a bipartisan effort. It was passed in a bipartisan way last October. There is no reason not to do this now. In fact, a former Republican House Member said, on education, We should champion communities and parents, reduce class size, and increase accountability.

   Mrs. MURRAY. Let me just conclude, because I know the Senator from Maryland would also like to speak, education is an issue that is important to all of us. Education is an issue that is important to everyone at home as well. I will again plead with the chairman from the committee to allow us to offer our amendments, to get an up-or-down vote, to limit the number of amendments, but to let us move forward on issues like this, like class size, that are bipartisan, that have been agreed to before, that the American public wants and that makes a difference for all of our children. 
   Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.

   Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I commend my colleague from Montana, Senator BAUCUS, for his work on education and his understanding that this is a key issue we need to address from the Federal level. Too often today we hear from people who say, ``No, this is a local issue, this is just a State issue.'' Of course it is; it is absolutely a local issue; it is absolutely a State issue. But we have to do our part, too, whether it is passing the Ed-Flex bill so we can reduce some of the bureaucratic regulations or whether it is providing additional resources for those districts to shrink class size or working with teacher-training and technology. These are things we have to address, and I thank my colleague from Montana for his work on this. 
   Mr. President, I rise today to talk about an amendment I will be offering shortly on the Ed-Flex bill, which is going to be on the floor probably in the next several minutes. The amendment I offer is one that many of my colleagues have come to the floor to talk about and to support, because it is an issue that parents and teachers and community leaders and business leaders truly understand when it comes to the issue of education. That is the fact that too many of our classrooms are overcrowded; too many of our teachers are trying to teach to classes with 30 or 35 students. They are not giving students the individual attention they need in order for them to learn the skills that we need them to learn, whether it is reading or writing or math or science. 
   The Murray-Kennedy amendment which I will be offering will simply authorize a 6-year effort to help our school districts hire 100,000 new, well-trained teachers in grades 1 through 3. School districts will be able to use up to 15 percent of those 
   funds for professional development activities so they can improve the quality of their teaching pool--something that all schools tell us they need. And, after meeting the target ratio of 1-to-18 in grades 1 through 3, school districts will be able to use the funds for professional development activities. This is an amendment, again, that parents and teachers and community leaders support. We have heard from law enforcement, we have heard from businesses, that we need to help address this from the national level. 
   When parents send their children to school next fall--next fall, 6 months from now--they are going to do what they do every fall when their child comes home from school on the first day. They are going to sit them down and they are going to ask them: Who is your teacher and how many children are in your class? They ask those questions because they know the number of students in the child's classroom will make a difference in their child's ability to learn that year and they know who their teacher is. If it is the best qualified teacher, their child will have a successful year. 
   Next year, next fall when they ask that question, those schools that those children attend will have a new tool for helping students to learn. That is because of the budget bill we passed last year. Because of our actions, approximately 30,000 new, well-prepared teachers will go into classrooms across this country and we will be able to say we have made progress. 
   Last year, as all of you will remember, I came to the Senate Chamber many times to fight to pass my bill, S. 2209, which was the Class Size Reduction and Teacher Quality Act of 1998. 
   You will also recall that I finally got my language into the appropriations negotiations and then worked closely with the administration and with leaders here on Capitol Hill to get it passed, and it did pass, after a bipartisan discussion and in a bipartisan way. Last fall, last October, Republicans and Democrats alike touted their success at providing local school communities with much-needed help to improve learning for every child by reducing class size in grades 1 through 3. 
   The American people are watching this week as we talk about education. They fully expect this Congress to continue to support education efforts that really work, such as reducing class size and hiring quality teachers. They want to know whether what we did last October was just for a political moment or whether we really are committed to reducing class size so our children across this country will get the kind of education they need. We started the job last fall and now we need to finish it. We have to provide the schools the remainder of the funding necessary to hire 100,000 new and better prepared teachers over the next 6 years. 
   Our first and best opportunity for a bipartisan solution is this debate on S. 280, which is the Ed-Flex bill that we are going to be discussing shortly. This is a perfect opportunity for early positive success, and people are watching to see if we are going to work together on this critical issue this year. This week Americans are telling Congress they want to see passage of the Murray-Kennedy amendment to reduce class size and improve teacher quality. 
   Mr. President, my class size reduction proposal honors the bipartisan agreement we achieved last year. It requires no new forms and no redtape. It focuses on hiring new teachers, but it 
   also makes investments in teacher quality from the outset. It allows districts that meet their goals of getting to 18 or fewer students in classes in grades 1 through 3, to be able to use that money to improve class size in  other grades, or to take steps to improve the quality of their teaching pool. 
   Class size reduction isn't some new national idea. Local students, parents, teachers, State and local policymakers have asked for this kind of national investment in class size reduction for years. My proposal emphasizes local flexibility in making improvements. 
   Mr. President, let me talk for a minute about the Ed-Flex bill. Both last year and this year I have been very supportive of the Education Flexibility Partnership Act. That is because I think to change thinking among local and State policymakers is a good thing. It frees them from some of the restrictions that may keep them and our public schools from becoming the best that they can be. But a change in thinking alone is not enough. Local schools need action. They need investment. They need resources in order to show measurable improvement for all children. 
   With class size reduction funds, we will have new, well-trained teachers so every child, every child in this country, grades 1 through 3, can get the attention they need and that they must have in order to improve the quality of their learning. 
   Once local educators have a plan for improving student achievement, we must make key investments at the national level to help them get the job done. This means funding class size reduction, teacher quality improvement, and school construction. It also means passing Ed-Flex, which we all want to do. Today is our best chance to pass both Ed-Flex and class size reduction and send a strong message to local educators that we have heard their concerns and we are responding. Congress does need to pass Ed-Flex, but, more importantly, it must pass the Murray-Kennedy amendment to reduce class size and improve teacher quality. 
   Mr. President, we have to continue to improve the effort that we began last year, right here, in a bipartisan effort to help local schools, local teachers, and local communities get the results they need. Schools across this Nation are fully engaged in this debate right now over quality in learning and in identifying what works to improve learning for students. Local education leaders know that class size reduction is effective. They know as they reduce class size they can also improve the quality of their local teaching pool by improving professional development, training certification and recruitment. 
   Local communities are using the Federal class size and teacher quality effort as a way to beef up their own investment in the future of young people. Governors and State legislators across this country are proposing class size investments this year based on our successful efforts of last year. They are watching to see whether or not we really mean that we are committed to class size reduction or it was just a political move from last year. 
   In Washington State, my home State, Governor Gary Locke and key State legislators are debating these investments right now in Olympia and watching what we are doing so there is an important reason right now to pass the class size amendment today. Local school districts, school boards across this country--and I was a former school board member so I know what 
   they do in February and March; they put their budgets together for the following years--are looking to us to see if we are going to continue this investment so that they can begin to put their budgets together and hire the staffs they need to make a commitment to now, so when those first hires are made in July, they know that this just wasn't a one-time bill, but this bipartisan Senate and Congress, this administration meant what they said last fall when they said class size reduction is a national priority. 
   We cannot wait to pass this amendment. We need to do it now so that those school boards and those local communities know that we say what we mean and we follow up on it right here in Washington, DC. 
   I will be offering this amendment later. I hope to be talking again about it today. This is clearly an issue for which parents and communities are looking to us, to trust the Federal Government. Will they follow up on their word? Will they make an investment that actually makes a difference? As we go through this debate, I will show you, all of my colleagues, and the country, studies that show that class size reduction makes a difference in student learning. We have a responsibility as the Federal Government. We have to live up to our commitment and not just make promises about education but truly make investments that work. 
   I thank my colleagues for the time this morning. I look forward to their support in a bipartisan way for the class size amendment. 
   Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mrs. MURRAY. I thank the Presiding Officer and thank my colleague for yielding me time. 
   Mr. President, I was out here earlier today to talk about the issue of class size. And we are currently discussing the Ed-Flex bill which is a bill that simply means the Federal Government transfers its paperwork to the State governments in terms of flexibility in allowing the school districts to have waivers for different requirements, which I do not oppose, and I think a number of our colleagues will support that. 
   But what is really expected of us in today's world, where parents and students and teachers and business leaders and community leaders are asking us to deal with education, is to deal with issues that really make a difference in the classroom and in learning. 
   I will be offering my amendment, as a 6-year effort, to help school districts hire 100,000 new, well-trained teachers in grades 1 through 3. I talked a little bit about that this morning. I wanted to come to the floor this afternoon because one of the questions surrounding reducing class size is whether it is really connected to learning. 
   When I offer my amendment, I will be talking about four different issues which I think are important reasons that we do this: 
   First, that it is a bipartisan effort. This is an effort that we began last October. It was supported by Democrats and Republicans. It was supported in both Houses, and it was supported by the administration. We all told our school districts across this country we were going to help them reduce class size. They are now putting their budgets together, and we need to show them that in a bipartisan way we are going to continue this partnership and reduce class size. 
   Second, I will be talking about research. I will be talking more about that in just a minute. So I will come back to that. 
   The third reason to do this is that there is broad public support. I hear from law enforcement officers, I hear from business leaders, I hear from teachers, I hear from school board members, I hear from parents, in particular, and I hear from young people that reducing class size is critical and that we need to be a part of the solution on this. 
   Finally, I will next week talk about the fact that there is a compelling policy reason to pass this amendment now. That is because school districts across this country, school board members, are making their decisions about their budgets right now. They need to know whether last October was just a fluke. Was last October just a political message because of the election or are we really committed to class size reduction? 
   I will be talking about all of those arguments next week. But this afternoon I really want to focus on the research because I think it is very important that we show why class size reduction really works. 
   Mr. President, I have behind me a chart which shows that K-12 enrollments are at record levels. That is why we need to deal with this issue. If you will look, we have gone from 45,000 in 1985 and will go all the way up to just under 55,000 in the year 2005. Our school districts are dealing with jammed class sizes, and they are going to get worse if we do not begin to deal with this issue. 
   All last year, when I talked about my amendment on class size reduction, I talked about research and what it shows. I referenced a 1989 study that was done of the Tennessee STAR Program, which compared the performance of students in grades K through 3 in small and regular-sized classes. They found that students in small classes significantly outperformed other students in math and reading; every year, at all grade levels, across all geographic areas, students performed better in math and reading. 
   Ask any businessman out there, ask anybody who is hiring a student, ask any teacher, ask any professional, and they will tell you, we need to focus on math and reading in our young 
   students. Reducing class size makes a difference. We knew that from the 1989 study. 
   A followup study of that STAR Program in 1995 found that students in small classes in grades K through 3 continued to outperform their peers at least through grade 8. They followed these kids, if they started in 1989, and they continued into 1995 outperforming their peers, with achievement advantages especially large for minority students. 
   Other State and local studies have since found that students in smaller  classes outperform their peers in reading and math, perform as well or better than students in magnet or voucher schools, and that gains are especially significant among African American males. 
   Mr. President, many of our colleagues have come to the floor decrying the state of education and talking about the performance of our students in math and in reading. Small class sizes make a difference; students perform better. A 1997 national study by Educational Testing Service found that smaller class sizes raise average achievement for students in fourth- and eighth-grade math, especially for low-income students in ``high-cost'' regions. 
   Particularly of note in the 1997 ETS study was the finding that in eighth grade the achievement effect comes about through the better discipline and learning environment that the smaller class size produces. As policymakers try to make decisions that will affect students in the critical years of middle school, class size makes a difference in terms of behavior and academic achievement. Class size in those early grades transfers to better achievement in the middle grades. 
   Mr. President, there is good news. These students who were followed in 1985 have continued to be followed, and many of them have now graduated or are just graduating. And last week--just last week--on February 25, I received letters from the head researchers who have been studying the success of the STAR project. As of June of 1998, most of the students from STAR have graduated. A pilot study showed that ``more [of these] students from small classes [in the early grades] had enrolled in college-bound courses (foreign languages, advanced math and science), and had higher grade point averages than students who attended regular or regular-aide classrooms. 
   ``The findings also suggested that small-class students''--students who have been in small class sizes in the early grades --``progress through school with fewer special education classes, fewer discipline problems, lower school dropout rates, and lower retention rates than their peers who had attended regular-size and regular-size classrooms with teacher aides.'' 
   Mr. President, they are now showing us that not only did it make a difference when they were in kindergarten, first, second, and third grades because they were in a small class size, but it made a difference when they graduated. It made a difference on whether or not they went on to college. It made a difference with their grades. It made a difference with their learning. 
   I have behind me a quote from a letter by Helen Pate-Bain and Jayne Boyd-Zaharias, who were part of the STAR research. They said, ``We can say with full confidence that the findings of this landmark study fully support class size reduction.'' These are the researchers who have been following these young kids who are now graduating. And they began in early grades some years ago. 
   They said students from small classes--this is what their research shows--enrolled in more college-bound courses, such as foreign languages and advanced math and science. These were kids who came from small classes. They were confident when they graduated. They knew these tough subjects. And they felt qualified to go on and enroll in tougher courses as they went on, because they had a smaller class size when they were younger. They learned the skills they needed. They got the confidence they needed. They had the one-on-one with an adult that allowed them to go on to these kinds of courses. Students from small classes had a higher grade point average. They did better in school. Learning, small classes: Completely connected. They had fewer discipline problems. 
   You can ask why. I can tell you as a former teacher and a parent of kids in public schools and having been out there many, many times with young kids, when you pay attention to a child when they are having a discipline problem, and you deal with it directly, then you can move on and not continue to have a child with a discipline problem. If you are in a large class with 30 kids, you can't pay attention enough to those kids who have learning difficulties or who are just needing attention, and they tend to be discipline problems later. And this study backs this up. Students from small classes have fewer discipline problems. 
   Finally, they had a lower dropout rate. These students from small classes stayed in school. Students in smaller classes, especially minorities and low-income students, are more likely to take college admission tests. The chart shows this. The graph on the left is large classes; on the right is small classes. Looking at all students, if you were in a small class, you are much more likely to take college admission tests. 
   Students in smaller classes had significantly higher grades in English, math and science. Again, how many times have we heard from our colleagues on the floor that we need to make significant gains in learning, particularly in English, math and science. Talk to any business leader today. They will tell you they are looking to hire students who come out of our K-12 programs who have a good, solid background in English, math and science. Smaller classes meant higher grades in every part of the study. 
   Dr. Krueger said:  
   These results suggest that reducing class size in the early grades for at least one year--especially for minority or low-income students--generates the most bang for the buck.  
   No surprise. 
   I will be offering an amendment to make our commitment to reduce class size continue over the next 6 years. This is a commitment we made last October. We need to continue to stand behind it. 
   We have teachers, we have school boards, we have communities, we have businesses, we have young students out there today who know what these studies show--that it will make a difference if we reduce class size. We need to do this now. We need to keep our commitment. 
   It is going to be bipartisan. If we don't get it done today, I will keep doing it until we get it done, because it is the right thing to do. We hear a lot of rhetoric on the floor about education. We hear that we need to make a difference. My amendment will make a difference. Ask any parent, ask any teacher, ask any student. 
   I thank my colleague from Vermont for yielding me the time, and I look forward to the debate we will have next week on this amendment.

   Mrs. MURRAY. I thank the Senator from Nevada. 
   I wanted to ask a question and share a story with him, because I think what we are talking about in terms of the dropout prevention is so important today. 
   I am sure the question that the Senator from Nevada hears so often, and the Senator from Illinois hears so often in these debates today is, What role does the Federal Government have in this? Should this be a local decision? Should we just hand the dollars down to our local districts? 
   What I want to share with you is that I met with a number of students last week in Washington State who had fallen through the cracks. I come from a State where the constitution says it is the paramount duty of the State to provide funding for education, and we do a good job. But we are struggling like everyone else with our budgets at home. This school happened to be in a district that has well-founded schools. This was a young student who had fallen through every single crack and dropped out of school. What brought him back was the Federally funded School-to-Work Program. When I asked the student if the Federal Government had a role, he said, ``Absolutely yes. You need to be there when everybody else fails.'' 
   I am wondering if the Senator from Nevada has heard that as well.

   Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Illinois. I thank the Senator from Nevada for his work on this extremely important issue and wish him well as he offers this amendment next week on this important bill. I thank my colleagues for allowing us today to talk about issues that are really going to make a difference in our classrooms across the country. 
   Mr. President, across this country families are having conversations at their breakfast tables about how we can improve education. They are talking about reducing class size. They are talking about afterschool programs. They are talking about dropout prevention. They are talking about teacher training, because parents know that is what is going to make a difference for their own child, for their family, for their neighborhood, and for their community. That is the type of conversation we need to be having on this floor in this Senate in this Congress, as well. I am delighted that we are finally going to have the opportunity to do that. 
   Mr. President, I am pleased that one of the first bills that is going to be considered is S. 280, which is the Ed-Flex bill. It is a bill that will help States develop new and innovative programs, and it is an important issue and one that I am glad we are going to address and that I am happy to support. 
   I think it is really important to note that merely improving the process is not enough. We also have to make an immediate and a direct impact on the overcrowded classrooms that our children across this country find themselves in every single day in this country. 
   That is why I am going to be introducing an amendment that will authorize a 6-year effort to continue to help local school districts hire 100,000 new, well-trained teachers nationally to begin to reduce class size in first through third grade where it will have the most impact.  
   My amendment builds on the bipartisan success of last year's agreement. It is based on local control and flexibility, and it focuses on improving teacher quality, which is so important. Local school districts will make all the decisions about hiring and training their new teachers. Any school district that has already reduced class size in those early grades to 18 or fewer students will be able to use the funds to either further reduce class size in the early grades or to reduce class size in other grades or carry out activities to help improve teacher quality. 
   My amendment will also provide accountability and ensure that schools communicate with parents which is so essential today. These funds are supplementary, and they cannot replace current spending on teachers or teachers' salaries. School districts will be required to send a report card in easily understood language to their local community including information about how achievement has improved as a result of reducing class size, and they won't have to fill out any new forms. Reducing red tape and improving local decisionmaking in education programs is a bipartisan effort, and both Ed-Flex and my class size reduction amendment accomplish both. 
   Last year's bipartisan agreement that we reached included my legislation to provide $1.2 billion as a downpayment on the goal of hiring 100,000 new teachers, and it did it without requiring any new reports or any new forms. Governors and legislators across this country are now responding to our budget agreement last year and addressing this at their local levels. Local school districts are putting together their budgets right now as we speak and teachers are writing their lesson plans for next year with the expectation that we will deliver on the promise that we made to them last year. They are all counting on us. We must take this opportunity to now fulfill our commitment to reduce class size. 
   Mr. President, smaller classes mean a better education for children. Studies have shown it. Teachers know it. Parents know it. And they know it from experience. I have seen it with my own eyes. Controlling a room of 30 children is not teaching. It's crowd control. We need to return to teaching. 
   Just yesterday, I heard from Christi Rennebohn-Franz, who is a first and second grade teacher in Pullman, WA, and she wrote and told me that ``without small class sizes, we cannot reach all children and give them the time that they deserve. If you have too many students in your class, you go home every day knowing that you came up short giving them the attention they need.'' 
   Another teacher from Fircrest, WA, wrote to me to say that ``since I teach at an at-risk school, lower class size means that I can more effectively work with students on a variety of problems they bring to my classroom every day.'' 
   Mr. President, I am looking forward to working with Senators from both sides of the aisle to ensure that we meet our promise to these teachers and all the other parents and students across America to reduce class size and truly make a difference in the education of our children and our country's future. 
   Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.

   Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, the Senator from Illinois brought up an extremely important point, and that is that hiring new teachers is one part, hiring well trained teachers is the second part, and providing classrooms for them clearly is a critical part. That is one of the reasons why in my amendment we make sure that it is very flexible language, so that local school districts that do have a school construction, a very real school construction crunch can use those dollars in a very flexible way so the teachers can work jointly in classrooms, that it isn't just one teacher per classroom, that we can do some local ways of providing extra 
   one-on-one help with youngsters who need it the most. 
   We also must address the school construction problem. It is a real challenge to crumbling schools that exist across our country where our kids are in unsafe classrooms, where they are crowded simply because there is no space to put them. It is an area we have to address, and I am delighted the Senator from Illinois recognizes that.

   Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I come to the floor to urge my Colleagues to support the pending Wellstone amendment. I want to thank Senator WELLSTONE for his efforts on behalf of battered spouses in the military and commend him for his diligence on this issue. 
   As many of you know, both Senator WELLSTONE and I have worked hard to address the needs of victims of domestic violence. Stopping domestic violence should be a priority regardless of whether or not the batterer is a civilian or member of the military. Unfortunately, we have not yet done enough to protect military dependants who are victims of abuse. 
   The Wellstone amendment would protect the privacy of military dependent's medical and counseling records. Currently, dependents of the military are not afforded the same assumption of privacy as civilian are for their medical records. If a spouse of a member of the military is battered and she seeks health care services for the treatment of the abuse, her records should not become public where they could later be used against her. 
   We know one of the most important factors for domestic violence victims is privacy. If a battered woman seeks help in an emergency room or through a counselor, her medical records remain private. The records cannot be released without her consent. This assumption of privacy is crucial for women to come forward and ask for help. Because there is no assumption of privacy for military dependents, the chances that these women to will seek medical help and counseling is severely reduced. 
   We have heard from advocates that work with battered military dependents. They have seen how this lack of privacy protection affects their ability to help victims of domestic violence and their children. They have told us that this change is necessary and important. I urge my Colleagues to listen to the recommendations of those who are truly on the front lines in preventing domestic violence. They know this is the right thing to do. 
   This amendment has been adopted in the past by the Senate and I urge my Colleagues to again send the message to battered military dependents that they should never fear seeking medical help or counseling and that they do not have to remain in violent, abusive relationships. 
   I urge my Colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this amendment. 
   Mr. WARNER addressed the Chair.

   Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. Chief Justice, this past year certainly has been a difficult time for America. I have to say, as a citizen, as a woman, and as a parent, I cannot begin to describe how deeply disappointed and angry I am with the President. 
   I came to Washington, D.C. in 1992. Over the last 6 years I have worked with Bill Clinton. I trusted him. I thought I knew him. I refused to believe he would demean the presidency in the way that he has. His behavior was appalling and has hurt us all. 
   But as a Senator, I have an obligation under the Constitution that transcends any sense of personal betrayal I might have. I am sworn to render my judgment based on the evidence presented and the larger question of what the framers of the Constitution meant when they wrote the impeachment clause. 
   I have listened carefully throughout this debate. I have read and listened to every available article and argument. Like all of you, I have spent more hours on this case that I ever wanted to and have felt the tremendous weight of this decision. 
   I believe that perjury and obstruction of justice can be considered high crimes. The question is whether the facts in this case support the allegations that the President committed these crimes. 
   The Republican House managers presented a theory. But after listening carefully to both sides and, most importantly, reviewing the words of the witnesses themselves, they did not prove their theory of perjury and obstruction of justice beyond a reasonable doubt to me. If we are to remove a President for the first time in our Nation's history, none of us should have any doubts. 
   We must also ask ourselves how it would affect the country to remove this President after such a partisan process. A conversation I had with a constituent not long ago really struck a chord with me. He said to me,  
   I am old enough to remember President Nixon's resignation. I know how deeply it affected the psyche of an entire generation. I know it made many of us cynical of politics for a long, long time. Please don't put us all through that turmoil again. This country would be punished and hurt by a presidential removal. This country doesn't deserve to be punished for this President's behavior.  
   So despite my personal disgust with the President's actions, I intend to vote ``not guilty'' on both articles of impeachment. 
   Our founders were wise. They knew the President would be imperfect. They knew he would stumble and fall. While it would be wrong to suggest they approved of such behavior, they were not interested in the individual and his flaws. They sought to protect the nation. 
   They set a very high standard for the legislative body to meet before overturning the results of an election--the very basis of our democracy. They declared it would only be for the crimes most threatening to our nation. They did not establish the impeachment process to punish a wrongdoer; they established it to protect America. 
   This President's behavior was reprehensible, but it does not threaten our nation. In the past year, despite the scandal that ran on the front page nearly every day, our country has prospered. Our economy is growing. Our waters and air are cleaner. Our communities are safer. Our education system is stronger. America is not poised on the brink of disaster. Our democracy is safe. 
   But what of our legacy in this process? What will I tell my daughter, or  tell a classroom of young students? Well, it doesn't take a lawyer or a constitutional scholar to tell them that no matter how difficult it is, tell the truth. The lie will hurt you much, much more. It can consume you, your friends, your family, your nation. It can destroy those you love and diminish you forever in their eyes. 
   This President now knows that. His legacy will be tainted with the anguish he inflicted on the people and country he loves because of his selfish and disgraceful behavior. It is a weight that he alone will bear for the rest of his life. 
   We have heard a lot of emotions and strong feelings on this floor from both sides. I respect the deep convictions of everyone in this room. I am saddened it has appeared partisan. But it is my hope that we can now turn the page on this sad part of America's history and put an end to the recriminations. 
   Mr. Chief Justice, point of personal privilege. 
   It is hard to stand before you without Scott Bates behind me. I knew him as all of you did as a loyal, excellent Senate employee. But I also knew him as a Dad. We stood together as parents on a soccer field cheering on our daughters in victory and hugging them in defeat. He will be missed. 
   But his absence should serve as a reminder that although we have been totally engrossed in this issue for far too long, there is life outside of these doors. There are friends to be hugged, kids to be educated, parents to take care of. 
   I hope when this day is over, we will set aside our differences and remember there are a lot more important things each of us needs to be concentrating on, both professionally and personally. It's time to move on.

   Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, today I have introduced legislation designating the federal building located at West 920 Riverside Avenue, Spokane, Washington, as the ``Thomas S. Foley Federal Building and United States Courthouse.'' The bill also designates the plaza located immediately in front of the building as the ``Walter F. Horan Plaza.'' 
   Speaker Tom Foley had a long and distinguished career in the United States House of Representatives. He served for 30 years, concluding his service as Speaker of the House in the 103rd Congress. He was also Speaker in the 102nd Congress, and held positions as Majority Leader, Majority Whip, and Chairman of the House Agriculture Committee. Speaker Foley now serves as our nation's Ambassador to Japan. 
   Tom Foley is a native of Spokane, Washington, and earned his undergraduate and law degree from the University of Washington. His parents were highly respected citizens of Spokane. 
   Mr. Foley personified the high ideal to which all of us aspire as public servants and Members of Congress. First and foremost he was a gentleman who sought consensus, recognizing the value of maintaining a good working relationship among colleagues. He loved Congress, and believed it to be the best forum for democracy in the world. 
   Speaker Foley worked tirelessly to promote and strengthen the Northwest's economy. During my first two years as a Senator, I enjoyed working with him and I am proud of our joint efforts to help our constituents, especially in the successful promotion of Washington wheat and apples on both domestic and international markets. Without Mr. Foley, we would likely not be exporting our agricultural products to as many destinations across the globe as we do. Today, he continues to see that our goods are sold in places, such as Japan, that historically have had tightly controlled markets. 
   Today I also honor another Washington native, Walter F. Horan. He served 22 years, from 1943 to 1965, as the Congressman from eastern Washington. Representative Horan was raised in Wenatchee, served in the Navy during the First World War, graduated from Washington State University in Pullman, and raised apples on his family farm. 
   As a member of the Appropriations Committee, Representative Horan was an excellent advocate for western interests, especially those of his constituents in eastern Washington. As a farmer himself, he knew the needs of the people he served and urged the Congress to pass laws to ensure their economic prosperity. He died in 1966 and is buried in his beloved hometown of Wenatchee. 
   It is my honor to sponsor legislation that permanently recognizes the contributions these two Washingtonians have made to my state and our nation.

   Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I come here today to talk about our Nation's first investment in the next century: the budget for the year 2000. I want to say how great it is that we are turning our attention to the issues that are important to America's families. 
   When I first came to Washington, DC, the deficit was $290 billion. We had to make some very tough budget decisions to get the Nation's books back in balance. Now our economy is growing and it is strong. This year, the Office of Management and Budget projects a surplus to be $79 billion. That is the biggest surplus in American history. It hasn't been easy to get to this point and we still have a lot of work to do. 
   Now we have to use this opportunity to make critical investments in our Nation's senior citizens and in our children. We have an obligation to ensure the dignity of the previous generation and to prepare the next generation for a successful future. The budget we have before the Senate will help us do that. 
   This budget keeps our commitment to save Social Security first. It will set aside more than 60 percent of the surplus to extend the solvency of the Social Security trust fund until 2055. And it takes important steps to protect older women who depend on Social Security, but must continue to work to supplement their incomes. This budget will increase their survivor's benefits after the deaths of their husbands and eliminate the earnings limitation. 
   This budget will strengthen Medicare and provide more stability. It also gives assistance to the elderly and disabled who need long-term care in their families by providing a $1,000 tax credit. 
   We have to also make education a top priority. This budget provides desperately needed funds to fix our Nation's worn out schools and our overcrowded classrooms. It provides tax credits to help States and local school districts build and renovate public schools, 
   and it continues our commitment to hiring 100,000 new and well-trained teachers. In addition, it provides flexibility at the local level for schools to ensure all children receive a quality education, and it calls for tough new accountability measures to hold schools and teachers to high standards. 
   This budget is by no means perfect. The funding for educating children with special needs is inadequate, and I will work to address this inequity. The Federal Government has made a commitment to meet 40 percent of the cost of educating disabled children, but we have yet to come close. As we work to improve our schools and raise our academic standards, we must not leave disabled children behind. 
   I know that as we go through the budget process we will have our disagreements, but I am looking forward to an open discussion of the issues and working together to accomplish a bipartisan agreement that serves the American people well. 
   This budget provides a real framework for action. I applaud the President's pledge to save Social Security and prepare for the challenges of a new century. Now we must move forward. The clock is ticking. It is time for us to work on the issues and the priorities of America's families. 
   Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor. 
   Ms. COLLINS addressed the Chair.

    Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, on January 13th, a Fairchild based KC-135 crashed near Geilenkirchen Air Base in Germany. Today, Team Fairchild and its many supporters gathered at the Spokane Opera House to grieve and to honor the memories of four members of the Washington Air National Guard who perished aboard the KC-135 in the service to our country. 
   I have had the pleasure of traveling to Fairchild Air Force Base on numerous occasions and meeting with the fine men and women there. They provide an indispensable part of our nation's defense and serve with pride and professionalism. I know that this tragedy hits especially hard on that close-knit community, and so it is with a heavy heart that I join them in their grief. 
   The four who died in the crash were members of the Washington Air National Guard 141st Air Refueling Wing, based at Fairchild Air Force Base near Spokane, Washington. Members of the 141st Air Refueling Wing were in Germany for training purposes and were participating in a routine NATO flight to refuel surveillance planes. The fallen men were all from Washington state, all family men, and all heroes. 
   Major David W. Fite, the pilot of the KC-135, was a resident of Bellevue, Washington. He began his service in the Washington Air National Guard in 1991. He is survived by his wife, a brother and his parents. 
   Captain Kenneth F. Thiele, co-pilot, was a resident of Spokane, Washington and served in the Washington Air National Guard since September 1998. He is survived by his wife. 
   Major Matthew F. Laiho, navigator, was a resident of Spokane, Washington and served in the Washington Air National Guard since 1989. He is survived by his wife, two children and his parents. 
   Technical Sergeant Richard D. Visintainer, boom operator, was also a resident of Spokane, Washington. His service in the Washington Air National Guard began in 1972. He is survived by his former wife and children. 
   Colonel James Wynne, the Wing Commander, was quoted, ``The guard is such a close-knit extended family that this will certainly send a wave of grief throughout the unit. This is a tragic loss.'' Colonel Wynne is right. Fairchild grieves today, its spirit challenged by tragedy. I know Team Fairchild will serve as a comfort to grieving families and fellow Air Force personnel. 
   My thoughts and prayers are with the families of Major Fite, Captain Thiele, Major Laiho and Sergeant Visintainer. Each will be missed. Each will be remembered.

   Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Illinois for his work this morning, with our leader Senator TOM DASCHLE, in setting out the Democratic priorities that are so important to us and to the American people. 
   Having just returned from a very short weekend in my State, 2,500 miles away, it is clear that the American people are waiting anxiously to hear what the 106th Congress is planning to do regarding the business of the people. At the top of the list of people's concerns is the education of our young people. 
   Today, as you heard from our leader, we are presenting a comprehensive set of investments in America's public schools--school construction, before-and-after school care, improvements in teacher quality and class-size reduction. 
   In the fall of 1998, the U.S. Senate took the first important step on the path to reducing class size. In the fall of 1999, just a few months from now, when parents send their children off to school, they will ask them on the first day, as they always do: ``Who is your teacher? And how many children are in your class?" 
   But the schools those children attend next fall will have a new tool for helping students learn. Approximately 30,000 new, well-prepared teachers will go into classrooms across this country. Demonstrating that Capitol Hill can listen to the people and get things done, we got the 105th Congress to agree to starting on this important path. 
   This year, we must finish the job we started last fall. We must provide schools the remainder of the funding necessary to hire 100,000 new and well-trained teachers over the next 6 years. This year, our work will include the reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, the major law that governs K-12 education in this country. 
   As part of our work, we must authorize the class-size reduction effort we started last year in appropriations. We must finish the job for the people in local school communities who are relying on us to do our job. 
   People in schools across this Nation are fully engaged in the debate over educational quality and in identifying what works to improve learning for students. Local education leaders know that reducing class size is an effective part of local school improvement. 
   Research shows that it works and so does the experience of teachers and parents and students. Policymakers and educators know that as they reduce class size, they can also improve the quality of their local teacher pool by improving professional development, training, certification and recruitment. 
   Local communities are using the Federal class size and teacher quality effort as a way to beef up their own investment in the future of their young people. School boards are taking action. Governors and State legislators are proposing class-size investments this year based on our successful effort last year. 
   All of these people are moving ahead with class-size reduction, because last year their representatives in Washington, DC, finally heard the call for funding for more and better teachers. They are counting on continued funding, and we have come back this year to get it for them. I just want to take this opportunity to tell people directly--we intend to keep class-size reduction a national priority. 
   The proposal in the bill that was outlined by our Democratic leader today, and in a bill I will be introducing separately, honors the agreement that we achieved last year. It requires no new forms and no red tape. It focuses on hiring new teachers, but it also makes investments in teacher quality from the onset, and it allows districts that meet their goals of getting to 18 or fewer students in classes in grades 1 through 3 to use the money to improve class size in other grades or to take other steps to improve the quality of their teaching pool. 
   I can't tell you how many times I have heard from people since the end of last Congress, how thankful they were that their Congress started this important investment in class-size reduction. Students learn better when they get the help they need in their classroom. I have been hearing it from students themselves. They want to thank us for doing the right thing, and they want us to keep it up. 
   Mr. President, education really matters. This year, we have the country behind us and several major opportunities to seriously improve American schools to meet American expectations. But it will take a lot of hard work and courage to get there. We need all our school laws to work better for local communities, for our teachers and staff, for parents and families, and most importantly, for our students. We must keep in mind that the students are our real clients and organize our work around their needs and not ours.  
   We need better flexibility, better accountability, better 
   efficiency and better funding. We need to make some important investments in the nuts and bolts of providing education, class-size reduction, better facilities, better training for teachers and more opportunities for students to be safe and to learn. These investments cost money, and we just need to make it happen. 
   We also need better leadership and vision and articulation of why we are all working so hard--so that students learn better and faster and have more hope for the future. 
   As a former school board member, I can tell you that sometimes the decisions are not about money, they are about finding the best way to do things so students can learn. And we need to support those decisions as well. 
   A great example of this was our superintendent, John Stanford, of the Seattle school district. Superintendent Stanford, who died this year after a heroic battle with cancer, showed people in Seattle and around the Nation just what we can accomplish in our schools by setting the right tone, asking for the best effort possible, and not accepting less. Many adults in a community know the superintendent of their district, but never have I seen so many students, young children who knew that John Stanford was their superintendent and that he wanted desperately and personally for them to succeed and they responded. 
   You will see elements of all these ideas today that address all of these issues--clear vision, more flexibility, better accountability, increased efficiency and improved funding. You will see here what America is asking for its public schools: We need to set high standards, articulate a vision, and give people the support and backing they need to get the job done. When these bills pass into law, you will see American schools that work better, for better results, for all of our children. 
   I look forward to working with my colleagues and the American people to take these important steps for better schools across our land. As well, I thank our leader for speaking to legislation that he will introduce shortly on health care reform, retirement security, afterschool programs and more. These are the issues the American public wants us to address and work on, and I look forward to working with all of my colleagues to meet these challenges. I hope we can make progress this year and make a difference in the quality of life in all of the families in this country. Thank you, Mr. President. 
   Mr. BOND addressed the Chair.
