 Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am deeply saddened that the Senate will adjourn for the year without approving the nomination of James C. Hormel to be U.S. Ambassador to Luxembourg. Mr. Hormel's nomination has been pending in the Senate, but it has never even been scheduled for debate. 
Since James Hormel's nomination was favorably reported out of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee last year, many senators have asked the Majority Leader to schedule a debate and vote. Many have recognized Mr. Hormel's extensive knowledge of diplomacy, international relations and the business world, his outstanding record of service to his community and his nation, and his leadership qualities--all of which make him obviously qualified for the post to which he was nominated by the President. 
James Hormel graduated from Swathmore College and shortly thereafter earned his Juris Doctorate at the University of Chicago Law School. He served for several years as the Dean of Students and Assistant Dean at the University of Chicago Law School. Since 1984, he has presided as Chairman of EQUIDEX, Inc., an investment firm based in San Francisco. 
For the past 30 years, Mr. Hormel has been a dedicated philanthropist, generously working to support a wide range of worthy causes. For his unselfish acts of giving, he has received several awards and honors. In 1996, he was named Philanthropist of the Year by the Golden Gate Chapter of the National Society of Fundraising Executives. 
On the local level, Mr. Hormel is an active member of the San Francisco community working with several important civic organizations. His current projects include the San Francisco Chamber of Commerce, the Human Rights Campaign Foundation, the San Francisco Symphony and the American Foundation for AIDS Research. 
James Hormel has the necessary skills and talents to serve as an ambassador. He is clearly qualified to represent his country in Luxembourg. He has as clear a record of achievement and service as any ambassadorial nominee the Senate has ever considered. 
But despite Mr. Hormel's impressive resume and the favorable recommendation of the Foreign Relations Committee, his nomination was not even given the courtesy of a debate by the full Senate. Why not? Any senator who questioned Mr. Hormel's qualifications to be ambassador to Luxembourg could have done so in a public debate on the Senate floor. That is every senator's right. That is the Senate's procedure. That is the Constitutional process. 
Unfortunately, however, instead of a debate by the full Senate on the question of his nomination, Mr. Hormel himself was subjected to repeated accusations in the form of `morning business statements' and comments to the news media. 
I can only say, Mr. President, that, in my view, the Senate failed to take up the nomination of James Hormel for the sole reason that he is gay. 
The Senate should have debated and voted on this nomination. If it had done so, I am confident that Mr. Hormel would have been confirmed. But, because of the prejudice of a few individuals, James Hormel has been denied the opportunity to serve his country in a position at which I believe he would have excelled and made us all proud. 
The failure to act on the nomination of James C. Hormel will forever be a blot on the record of this Senate.

 Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I wish to express how disappointed I am that the 105th Congress has failed to act on legislation to increase protections for the millions of Americans whose health insurance benefits are managed by health maintenance organizations (HMOs). 
The Patients' Bill of Rights legislation, which was introduced by the Democratic Leader, Senator Daschle, and cosponsored by me and most of my Democratic colleagues, was endorsed by over 180 organizations, including the American Medical Association, the American Nurses Association, and the AARP. 
The Patients' Bill of Rights would have given protections to all 161 million privately insured Americans. It would have: Guaranteed patients access to emergency room services; ensured access to specialists for patients with serious or chronic conditions; given women direct access to the OB/GYN, and allowed them to designate their OB/GYNs as primary care doctors; allowed patients to appeal their insurance companies' decisions to an independent reviewer and receive timely decisions that would be binding on HMOs; protected doctors and nurses who advocate for their patients from being fired by an HMO; prohibit insurance companies from arbitrarily interfering with the decisions of doctors; ensured that doctors be able to decide which medications their patients should receive; and limited the ability of insurance companies to use financial incentives to get doctors to deny patient care. 
It is unfortunate that the Majority Leader would not allow a vote on the Patients' Bill of Rights. But this fight is not over. Americans continue to demand that their HMOs be held accountable for putting profits ahead of patients. Supporters of the Patients' Bill of Rights continue to believe that doctors--not HMO accountants--should make medical decisions. 
I urge the leadership of the 106th Congress, which will convene in January, 1999, to immediately schedule a debate and vote on the Patients' Bill of Rights, in order to secure basic patient protections for the 60 percent of all Americans who get their health insurance through HMOs.

 Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the retirement of Mr. Carney J. Campion. Mr. Campion has served California's Golden Gate Bridge, Highway and Transportation District for 23 years with a standard of excellence that deserves our recognition. 
As a Californian, and on behalf of all Californians, I want to personally thank Mr. Campion for his years of dedicated and outstanding service. Over the past 14 years, as general manager of the Golden Gate Bridge, Highway and Transportation District, Mr. Campion has been instrumental in advancing numerous projects aimed at improving the transportation infrastructure for California's future. His commitment to find better ways to serve the public was exemplified in his successful effort to modernize and expand the District's bus transit and administration facility in San Rafael. It was his leadership that sparked the purchase and preservation of the abandoned Northwestern Pacific Railroad right-of-way from Novato, California, north to Willits, California, for future transportation use. His innovative spirit led to many improvements of the Golden Gate Bridge and under his leadership the huge 50th Anniversary Celebration for the bridge was a roaring success. I was fortunate to have worked closely with him on a number of occasions, most recently in obtaining desperately needed federal funding for a portion of the $217 million seismic retrofit of the Golden Gate Bridge. 
Mr. Campion has also served as a diplomat by managing to bridge the political gap between San Francisco and North Bay representatives on the span's board. He deserves our admiration for performing his job superbly while continuing to display his commitment to best representing the interests of Marin, San Francisco and, most of all, the bridge which is a world-renowned landmark of my great state, the Golden Gate Bridge. 
Mr. President, Mr. Campion's ability to function effectively and creatively during his years of service are worthy of our unmeasurable gratitude. With Mr. Campion's retirement, the Golden Gate Bridge and the citizens of my state are losing the services of a committed and intelligent man. I wish him all the best, and hope his retirement is as fulfilling as his career.

 Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am so pleased that the 105th Congress has approved H.R. 3267, the Salton Sea Reclamation Act of 1998. This legislation is an important step toward an efficient and responsible restoration of the unique Salton Sea ecosystem. 
Earlier this year, I introduced S. 1716, the Senate version of the Salton Sea restoration legislation. H.R. 3267 includes portions of my legislation. Although it does not authorize all of the steps necessary to complete the recovery of the Salton Sea as my bill would have done, it is a necessary step toward that goal. 
Over the years, scientists, communities and politicians alike have been trying to draw national attention to the decline of the Salton Sea. Our late friend and colleague, Representative Sonny Bono, who died in a tragic skiing accident in January, worked tirelessly to make this issue an environmental priority for this Congress. 
The Salton Sea is a unique natural resource in Southern California. Created in 1905 by a breach in a levee along the Colorado River, the Salton Sea is California's largest inland body of water. It is one of the most important habitats for migratory birds along the Pacific Flyway. 
For 16 months after the breach, the Colorado River flowed into a dry lakebed, filling it to a depth of 80 feet. For a time following the closure of the levee, the water levels declined rapidly as evaporation greatly exceeded inflow. A minimum level was reached in the 1920s, after which the sea once again began to rise, due largely to the importation of water into the basin for agricultural purposes from the New and Alamo Rivers. 
Since there is no natural outlet for the sea at its current level, evaporation is the only way water leaves the basin. All the salts carried with water that flows into the sea have remained there, along with salts re-suspended from prehistoric/historic times by the new inundation. Salinity is currently more than 25 percent higher than ocean water, and rising. 
This extreme salinity, along with agricultural and wastewater in the sea, are rapidly deteriorating the entire ecosystem. The existing Salton Sea ecosystem is under severe stress and nearing collapse, with millions of fish and thousands of bird die-offs in recent years. Birds and fish that once thrived here are now threatened with death and disease as the tons of salts and toxic contaminants that are constantly dumped into the Salton Sea become more and more concentrated and deadly over time. The local economy is also being affected by the disaster at the Salton Sea by the loss of recreational opportunities, decrease in tourism, and the impact on agriculture. 
We all now agree that we must take the necessary long-term and short-term steps to stabilize salinity and contaminant levels to protect the dwindling fishery resources and to reduce the threats to migratory birds. However, there is no consensus on how that should be done. 
The Salton Sea Reclamation Act should answer those questions. It requires the Interior Department to report to Congress within two years on the options for restoring the Salton Sea, including a recommendation for a preferred option. Interior will review ways to reduce and stabilize salinity, stabilize surface elevation, restore the health of fish and wildlife resources and their habitats, enhance recreational use and economic development, and continue the use the Salton Sea for irrigation drainage. 
When this report is submitted to Congress, we will then have the information necessary to act swiftly to authorize construction of a restoration project. 
It has taken the hard work and dedication of many individuals to make this legislation a success. I would like to thank members of the Salton Sea Authority, including the Imperial County Board of Supervisors, the Riverside County Board of Supervisors, the Imperial Irrigation District, and the Coachella Valley Water District, the National Audubon Society, the Department of the Interior, Congresswoman Mary Bono, Congressman George Brown, Congressman Hunter, and the entire Salton Sea Task Force, Senator Kyl and Senator Chafee. 
Scientists have warned that the Salton Sea will be a dead sea within fifteen years. This legislation is an integral step to ensure that we avoid such a disaster. 
I am pleased that my House and Senate colleagues have agreed to this necessary and important legislation that will not only benefit Californians and our natural heritage, but will also carry on the legacy of Representative Bono.

 Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I want to express my deep disappointment and sadness that the Senate has failed to act on the nomination of Bill Lann Lee as Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights at the Department of Justice. 
Bill Lann Lee's nomination was sent to the Senate in July, 1997. I had the honor of introducing him to the Judiciary Committee, and I have spoken to the Senate numerous times to urge his confirmation. In my travels throughout my home state of California, I have heard over and over from his supporters, `please make sure Bill Lann Lee gets confirmed.' 
I cannot explain why the Senate failed to act on this eminently qualified nominee. I can only guess that an eminently qualified candidate fell victim to partisan politics. Mr. Lee has served for 10 months as the Acting Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights because the Judiciary Committee refused to report the nomination. The Committee did not act because it did not wish the full Senate to vote--because the majority of that Committee knew that Bill Lann Lee would be confirmed if a vote were taken. 
If any member of this body does not wish to confirm one of the President's nominees, then he or she should have the courage to vote that nominee down. But that did not happen. 
In all this time, one thing is certain; those who know Mr. Lee, and those who are aware of his record, know Mr. Bill Lann Lee is the best person for the position of Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights at the Department of Justice. Unfortunately, this nomination has been held back by a few senators who oppose Mr. Lee as head of the Civil Rights Division because, oddly enough, Mr. Lee believes strongly in civil rights. 
I want the record to be clear about Bill Lann Lee, his personal history and his professsional credentials, both of which make him the perfect candidate to be Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights. 
Bill Lann Lee was born in Harlem, the son of hardworking, patriotic, immigrant parents who came to this country because they believed America was the land of opportunity. His father, William Lee, not only spoke of this, but also showed his son by example, that a penniless immigrant who works hard in this country can make a better life for himself and for his family. Many of us know the senior Lee was a laundryman in New York, who faced daily unspeakable discrimination. What some of my colleagues may not know is that the senior Lee volunteered in the U.S. Army Air Force during World War II. He fought overseas for America and all that America stands for, and he advanced to corporal, where as an Army soldier, he was treated just like everyone else. 
Bill Lann Lee took to heart these lessons of hard work and dedication to America's values. He attended the renowned Bronx High School of Science. He went on to attend Yale on a scholarship and graduated Phi Beta Kappa and magna cum laude. He received his law degree from Columbia University Law school. 
Attending school, Mr. Lee was one of the most formally dressed students. He frequently wore white dress shirts to class, while his classmates wore sweatshirts with college logos. When I think of the reason why Bill Lann Lee wore white dress shirts every day, tears well up in my eyes. 
Bill Lee, who came from poverty, wore white dress shirts because these were the shirts left behind at his parents' laundry business. Bill Lee wore the clothes that were forgotten by others. He wore the clothes that his parents toiled over, despite the cramp conditions in their tiny laundry, despite the fact they all ate their meals amidst piles of dirty laundry. All this in hopes that one day their children would make something of themselves--an immigrant's dream--the American dream. And Bill Lann Lee wore those white dress shirts with pride, to save money for his family, to save money for his education, all this in hopes that one day he would fulfill that dream, and make something of himself. 
Mr. Lee spent most of his 24-year legal career with the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, which was founded by the late Supreme Court Justice, Thurgood Marshall. Lee left the Legal Defense Fund in 1983 and worked for the Center for Law in the Public Interest, but eventually returned to the Legal Defense Fund in 1988. 
During the course of his career, Mr. Lee showed his ability to build consensus and coalitions, fostering negotiations and settlements even as he litigated contentious civil rights cases. An example of this is a case alleging that Vons Grocery Stores' hiring practices kept women and minorities locked in entry-level jobs. Lee's skill to seek a settlement resulted in the praise of Vons' general counsel because the court decree expressly stated Vons was not required to meet quotas or hire unqualified individuals, but that Vons must show a good faith effort for hiring and promoting qualified minority employees. 
While Bill Lee's record speaks volumes, many have felt they wanted to add a few words. 
In a letter to Erskine Bowles, Mayor Richard Riordan of Los Angeles explained that Mr. Lee was opposing counsel in an important civil rights case (Labor/Community Strategy Center v. Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority) which was ultimately settled. Mayor Riordan writes, `The work of my opponents rarely evoke my praise, but the negotiations could not have concluded successfully without Mr. Lee's practical leadership and expertise.' Mayor Riordan believes Mr. Lee to have a stellar track record as a civil rights litigator, and in closing, writes: `Mr. Lee has practiced mainstream civil rights law. He does not believe in quotas. He has pursued flexible and reasonable remedies that in each case were approved by a court.' 
Additionally, former U.S. Senator Hiram Fong, a Republican from Hawaii, lends his support to Mr. Lee. Senator Fong, who served in the U.S. Senate for 17 years and was on the Judiciary Committee, states `I am herewith heartily endorsing the nomination of Bill Lann Lee to the position of Assistant United States Attorney General for Civil Rights . . . His record shows that he is an exceptional litigator with over 20 years experience with civil rights issues.' 
Also, William Murphy, District Attorney for Staten Island, New York, wrote on behalf of the National District Attorneys Association in strong support for Bill Lee. Mr. Murphy writes `I believe that as the Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights, he will remain fully cognizant of the need and expectations of the people of the United States to be provided effective, efficient and fair law enforcement services. I am convinced that he will do his utmost to insuring that honest and hardworking police officers are not tarnished by the acts of a few miscreants.' 
Even Kenneth Klein, the lead attorney on the opposing legal team on the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority case, wrote a letter of support for Mr. Lee. Mr. Klein, a former prosecutor, writes: `Notwithstanding the significant disparity between Mr. Lee's political philosophy and my own, I cannot think of a better candidate to fill the position of Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights than Bill Lann Lee.' 
Mr. President, again, I deeply regret that the Senate did not have the chance to vote on this nomination. I know that Bill Lann Lee would have been confirmed by a wide margin. I am sorry that those senators who disagreed with the President and his nominees to express that disagreement in the form of a vote.

Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I take this opportunity, on our last day of session, to say farewell to my colleague, Senator Dan Coats of Indiana. While we have disagreed on many issues, I note that he was a supporter of one of the most important legislative accomplishments of the past few years--the Family and Medical Leave Act. He has also long been a champion of government support for adoption, and is, as am I, a strong advocate for after school, tutoring and mentoring programs. Recently, he helped move through the Congress the reauthorizing bill for `Head Start', one of our most effective programs for disadvantaged children. 
Dan Coats is a long time member of the Big Brothers/Big Sisters of America, and was recently elected president of the organization. I know that he is looking forward to devoting more time to his Big Brother responsibilities, and I wish him all the best.

Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, as the Senate completes its work and the 105th Congress comes to a close, I want to take this opportunity to say farewell to one of my colleagues who has decided to leave this body and pursue other activities. 
The junior senator from Idaho, Dirk Kempthorne, and I were both elected to the Senate in 1992. We have served together for the past 6 years on the Environment and Public Works Committee. While we have disagreed on many environmental issues, I have always enjoyed working with him and appreciated his personal kindness. He is a gentleman of impeccable manners and good humor. And he is known to all his colleagues as one of the `workhorses' of the Senate: a senator who does his work quietly and responsibly, and does not insist on getting all the credit for the results. 
My very best wishes to Senator Kempthorne as he leaves Washington to return to his home in Idaho, and the best of luck in all that he does in the years to come.

Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I would like to say a few words before the close of the 105th Congress about my friend and colleague, Wendell Ford, the very distinguished senior senator from the great state of Kentucky. His retirement from the Senate this year leaves this body of government missing a cornerstone that I am not sure we can replace anytime soon. 
From the heartland of these United States, he is a strong, resonant voice for the working people of this nation. This Senate chamber will sound a bit hollow without that gruff, but friendly voice crying out for `order' in these chambers. 
I have served for six years now with Senator Ford. During our time together I have known him as a stalwart ally in our party and a valuable friend. As an indefatigable champion for Kentucky, he never betrayed that trust that the people who elected him four times to the United States Senate bestowed upon him. That he has been able to keep his feet firmly grounded in Kentucky's interests while extending his helping hand to Senators from every region of this nation is a testament to his skill, temperament and wisdom. 
I cannot speak of Senator Ford without expressing my admiration for his leadership on the Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation, particularly his service as chairman and ranking member of the Subcommittee on Aviation. No issue is small to Senator Ford if it is a big issue to his colleague. I remember early in my tenure here that he worked with me on an issue that I have struggled with every since I came to House of Representatives and later as a Senator. We needed the Federal Aviation Administration to work with other Federal agencies and clean up an abandoned radar site on Mt. Tamalpais in my home county of Marin. 
I had been here only a year or so before Senator Ford sliced through the bureaucratic tangle and resolved this local problem at long last in the 1994 FAA Reauthorization bill. 
He was also there for the State of California when we were trying to get the California Cruise Ship Industry Revitalization Act accepted in conference. He stood in the door of that conference--refusing to call it complete--until our provision was accepted. This provision has provided enormous benefits for our ports in California, and we are grateful for his untiring assistance. 
While helping on these local and State issues, he has been the strongest advocate for our airports, particularly in using the Airport trust fund for what it was intended modernizing and upgrading airports across the country to keep them safe and competitive. I was proud to see that we named the FAA reauthorization bill this year, the Wendell H. Ford National Air Transportation System Improvement Act. The truth is I feel like every time we have voted for the FAA reauthorization bill it has had his stamp upon it. 
I wish the Senator from Kentucky a fond farewell--but not goodbye. He will always be in my thoughts and in my heart. And I know his voice will still echo throughout these hallowed halls--and in the halls of our memories, we will forever remember Wendell Ford's decency, compassion, and plain old common sense.

Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, in 1962, a few weeks before becoming the first American to orbit the Earth, John Glenn appeared on the cover of Life magazine under the header, `Making of a Brave Man.' John Glenn is indeed a brave man, but to those of us who have served with him in the United States Senate, he is much more. He is a skilled legislator, a good friend, and an honorable and decent person. 
For the generation who remembers John Glenn's historic trip to space 36 years ago, his return this month abroad the space shuttle is truly special. At that time, the United States was in the midst of the cold war with the Soviet Union. The Soviets could boast many achievements in space, including the launching of the first satellite. It was a tense time, and ours hopes as a nation were with John Glenn and the U.S. space program. 
On February 20, 1962, America held it's collective breath as Glenn's Friendship 7 capsule circled the earth three times. During this mission, John Glenn showed us why he was our hero. When a faulty signal erroneously warned that the capsule's heat shields might come loose, he remained calm and cool, even as he watched fiery bits of spacecraft flash past him during reeintry into the Earth's atmosphere. The entire country beamed with pride at this heroic accomplishment. 
President Kennedy called space `a new ocean', and John Glenn will go down in history as one of it's first and most important explorers. His flight opened the door to future missions, such as the Mercury program, Gemini program, and eventually the Apollo program that put man on the moon. 
In a few weeks, America will once again beam with pride when John Glenn lifts off from Kennedy Space Center abroad the Space Shuttle Discovery. As opposed to his first mission, which lasted five hours, this mission is scheduled to last nine days. During that time, Senator Glenn will participate in a number of experiments designed to find parallels between the physical stress of space flight and the natural aging process. 
Scientists are hopeful of finding out why astronauts and the elderly suffer from similar ailments, such as bone and muscle loss, balance disorders and sleep disturbances. Understanding these physiological characteristics may open the door to new and innovated treatments. I am sure Senator Glenn is as excited about these potential breakthroughs as he is about his return to space. 
As a Senator, John Glenn has been a wonderful advocate on many important issues. Along with his hard work on space, technology and science issues, Senator Glenn has also been a strong voice on the need for his country to increase it's investment in education. So many times, I have seen Senator Glenn with school children in the Hart Senate Office Building, and I know that he inspires our next generation of leaders as he does us. 
So as Senator Glenn leaves the Senate, I want to give him my thanks for all that he has done for this country. Like all Americans, my thoughts and prayers will be with him as he makes history yet again. I wish him well on this and all his future missions.

Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I understand that in his last campaign Senator Bumpers used the slogan: `What a Senator Should Be.' I couldn't have summed it up better myself. 
Throughout his 24 years in this body, Dale Bumpers has set new standards for the office of Senator. He is sincere and compassionate. He speaks with eloquence and clarity. He is an idealist and a realist. He is courageous and principled. He can stimulate a debate and broker a deal. He has a deep understanding of the issues and a quick wit that amuses us all. He is a true populist whose dedication to improving the lives of Arkansans has benefited our nation as a whole. 
I am deeply honored to have served with Senator Bumpers for six years. I have learned a great deal from him. Because of him I have been fortunate to witness some of the Senate's most animated debates, on such issues as mining law reform, electric utility restructuring, protecting small business, preserving our public lands, arms control and fighting the now infamous space station. 
He has been a voice for our precious environment, champion of consumer rights, and he has always been willing to stand up for the `little guy', for the interests of regular folks. 
Senator Bumpers' illustrious career began long before he was elected to the United States Senate. As a young lawyer in Charleston, Arkansas, Dale Bumpers played a key role in the first integration of a public school after the Brown vs. Board of Education decision. 
He went on to serve as Governor of Arkansas for four years, and was recently voted the `Greatest Governor' in the history of Arkansas by the Arkansas Times. 
Fortunately, it was not often that Senator Bumpers and I were on opposite sides of an issue. However, one of my most memorable moments in the Senate was one such occasion. We were debating an important agriculture issue and to emphasize my point, I brought a frozen chicken on the Senate floor and slammed in on a desk. Senator Bumpers and Senator Pryor immediately raised a point of order and I had to remove that chicken from the Senate floor. 
Anyone who has had to face off against Senator Bumpers knows of the passion he feels for the issues he discusses and the people he represents. Even those who may oppose his views can't help but admire his lively speeches and personal stories. I will miss hearing his familiar sayings about pigs squealing under gates and fights with Betty. I will miss his pointer flying as he paces up and down the aisles of the floor. I will miss the passion in his voice. And most of all, I will miss my friend. 
Senator Bumpers is someone on whom I have grown to depend, a man who has always given a kind word, and a person who has been a true role model for us all. 
I thank the senior Senator from Arkansas for all that he has shared with us and all that he has taught us. No doubt there will be Senators who will continue to promote the causes he cared for so deeply. But I assure you, the debates will never have the same enthusiasm, the same passion or the same flare, that Senator Bumpers brought to this August body. 
It is with reverence, awe and deep affection that I pay tribute to the truly distinguished gentleman from Arkansas, Senator Dale Bumpers. I will miss him dearly.

Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I have decided to vote for the omnibus appropriations bill because it contains many things which are very beneficial to the people and the economy of my state of California, and it includes two of my top priorities--afterschool programs and the Salton Sea Restoration Act. 
I want to make it clear, however, that the process that brought us this bill is severely flawed. While the Senate Appropriations Committee, on which I sit, did its work and reported each appropriations bill to the full Senate, the leaders of this Congress failed to do the appropriations work. This omnibus bill is not the right way to legislate. 
I also want to say that I strongly object to the environmental riders in the bill, including legislation that will double the timber cut in several national forests in California. I realize that some of the riders were dropped from the final legislation and others were negotiated to have less impact, but the presence of any riders that harm our environment is unacceptable to me. 
First, let me say what I like about the omnibus legislation: 
EDUCATION 
The most significant achievement of the bill is its emphasis on funding for public education, including: 
$129 million to recruit, hire and train 3,500 teachers for California schools in order to reduce class size in the primary grades. 
$20 million to expand afterschool programs for 25,000 children in California. This is a $16 million increase for California. I am particularly gratified by the outcome here because I believe it reflects my bill, the `Afterschool Education and Safety Act', and the amendment I successfully attached to the Senate Budget Resolution calling for more afterschool funding. 
$77 million, a $12 million increase, for technology in schools programs, to help train teachers, and ensure computer literacy and access to Internet for California students. 
$875 million to California schools, a $35 million increase over last year, for disadvantaged students under the Title I program. Senator Feinstein and I worked very hard for this increase. 
$550 million for California Head Start programs, to serve 3,280 more California children than last year for a total of more than 80,000. 
$58 million, an increase of $3.6 million, through the Goals 2000 program to promote higher academic standards, increase student achievement, and help 12000 California schools implement school reforms. 
$26 million for California through the `America Reads' program, to help children in grades K-3 improving reading skills--all new funds. 
The largest Pell Grant ever to California: $920 million, an increase of $43 million over last year, to increase the maximum grant to college students to $3,125, 36% higher than maximum award last year.  
HEALTH 
The bill provides funding for several federal programs that are very important in my state, and the omnibus funding levels will result in great benefits to California: 
$2.3 billion, a $300 million increase, for medical research grants to California universities and research institutions through the National Institutes of Health (est.) 
$238 million , a $43 million increase, for the Ryan White Care Act for health care services to Californians with HIV and AIDS. 
At least $13 million for HIV/AIDS prevention and treatment for minority communities. 
An increase of between $11 and 21 million in funding for Housing Opportunities for Persons With Aids (HOPWA) who have limited financial resources. 
In addition, the bill accelerates the implementation of the health insurance premium tax deduction for the self-employed. By 2003, the deduction will be 100 percent. 
The omnibus legislation also requires federal health plans to provide coverage for contraceptive drugs and devices. 
Finally, the bill increases funding for the Centers for Disease Control by $226 million over last year--even more than the president's request--and specifies funds for important priorities such as childhood immunization ($421 million), breast and cervical cancer screening ($159 million), and chronic and environmental disease ($294 million). 
ECONOMY 
The legislation extends provisions of current law that help California's economy, including: 
The Research and Experimentation Tax Credit, which is of great importance to California's high tech and bio tech companies. 
The Work Opportunity Tax Credit, which encourages businesses to hire disadvantaged workers. 
The Trade Adjustment Assistance program, which helps workers and businesses adversely affected by free trade agreements. 
The Generalized System of Preferences authority of the President, which allows him to extend duty-free treatment on imports from certain development countries. 
There are a number of other funding provisions that are beneficial to my state's businesses and industries, and our economy, including: 
$204 million for the Advanced Technology Program, an increase of $11 million over last year, to develop cutting edge technologies. California receives more than any other state. 
$100 million for `Next Generation Internet', a federal program to connect universities to the Internet and to one another. Many California universities are part of this program: UCLA, Stanford, Berkeley, UC-Davis, UC-Irvine, UC-San Diego, Calif. Tech, and Cal State, and others. 
A 3-year moratorium on new taxes on Internet activities. 
Full funding for the international Monetary Fund. 
About double the number of visas available to foreign high tech, high skilled workers under the H-1B program. The bill raises the annual cap from 65,000 to 115,000 for next 2 years. 
An increase in the Federal Housing Administration's loan limit from $86,000 to $109,000, which will give more housing ownership opportunities to Californians. 
$283 million nationally for 50,000 Welfare to Work Housing Vouchers for families trying to make transition to jobs. This new program will help them get housing closer to jobs. 
AGRICULTURE 
The bill includes a number of important funding and legislative provisions for California farm interests: 
Extension of time for California citrus growers to conduct scientific review of whether Argentine citrus should be permitted into the U.S. 
Continued affordability for California farmers for crop insurance. 
$500,000 for pest control research that affects citrus fruit trees. 
$90 million for the Market Access Program, which benefits California companies that sell product overseas. 
In addition, the bill provides an increase of $75 million--to $633 million--for the Food Safety Initiative, to help implement improvements in surveillance of food borne illnesses, education about proper food handling, research, and inspection of imported and domestic foods. 
ENVIRONMENT 
The omnibus bill includes some good things for California, including: 
Salton Sea legislation to require a Department of Interior study on options for restoring the Sea. The bill also provides $14.4 million to fund research and restoration activities. 
$10,000 for an appraisal of the Bolsa Chica mesa. 
$2 million for land acquisition in the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area. 
$273,000 for operations at the Manzanar National Historic Site 
Continuation for the moratorium on new Outer Continental Shelf oil/mineral leases and drilling. 
$1 million for land acquisition in the San Bernardino National Forest. 
More generally, the bill provides a substantial increase for global climate change programs to more than $1 billion, a 25.6 percent increase over 1998. It also funds the President's Clean Water Action Plan at $1.7 billion--a 16.1 percent increase over 1998. This 5-year program helps communities and farmers clean up waterways which are currently deemed unswimmable and unfishable. 
INFRASTRUCTURE 
The bill provides a total of $293 million for California transportation projects, including $70 million for Los Angeles Metropolitan Transportation Authority Red Line, $40 million for the BART-to-San Francisco Airport line, and $17 million for the Santa Monica Bus Transitway for a dedicated highway express lane for buses. 
Other major California projects that are funded include $50 million for Los Angeles River flood control, $52 million for Port of Los Angeles expansion, $6 million for Port of Long Beach expansion, and $1.5 million for Marina Del Rey dredging (Boxer request)

Mrs. BOXER. I thank the Senator from Virginia for raising this issue. The commuter lane proposal sounds like an excellent compromise, and I hope Interior and the District will begin looking at this option immediately. 
As the ranking Democrat of the D.C. I would like to thank Senator Faircloth for his efforts as Chairman of the D.C. Appropriations Subcommittee. He has worked hard to address the District's financial ills, and I am pleased that we have begun to make some progress for the District to resolve its serious financial problems. 
In fact, the fiscal well being of the District has improved dramatically. The District ended fiscal year 1997 with a budget surplus of almost $186 million. The June, 1998 projections suggest that the District may have a surplus of $302 million for fiscal year 1998. 
The fiscal year 1999 D.C. Appropriations includes $494.59 million in Federal Funds. This amount represents an increase of $8.39 million above the President's Budget request for the District of Columbia. It is $38.4 million below the FY 1998 level. 
With regard to the District of Columbia Funds, the legislation largely reflects the consensus budget formulated by the Mayor, the City Council, and the Control Board. 
It is important to note that because of abuses of taxpayer funds, there is no appropriation to the Advisory Neighborhood Commissions (ANCs) as provided for in the consensus budget. However, this deletion of funds does not preclude the District from including funds for the commissions in future budgets so long as there are sufficient safeguards to protect taxpayers' interests. 
Mr. President, with respect to specific provisions of this bill, there are some good things, but there are also some bad provisions. 
On the plus side, this bill includes a $25 million federal payment for management reform. Within these funds, special attention will be given to fire and emergency medical services, the reopening of the Chief Medical Officer's laboratory, and implementation of a high-speed city-owned fiber network for voice and data services. 
The bill provides funds for the repair and maintenance of public safety facilities in the District. The Federal highway funds made available to the District include $98 million for local streets. 
The bill includes a $25 million federal contribution to the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority for improvements to the Metrorail station at the site of the proposed Washington Convention Center project. 
I am pleased that the bill sets aside $5 million to address the chronic need for additional community-based housing facilities for seriously and chronically mentally ill individuals in the District. 
The bill also provides an appropriation to the Children's National Medical Center for the Community Pediatric Health Initiative. This reestablishes an important public-private partnership to provide pediatric services to high risk children in medically under-served areas. 
The bill requires the Control Board to report to Congress on the status of any agreements between the District and all non-profit organizations that provide medical and social services to the District's residents. This will ensure that the District re-evaluates the decisions to terminate support and where possible renew support for these critical programs, including those of Children's Hospital. 
I am especially pleased that funding for homeless programs in the District will remain level for fiscal year 1999. In previous years, these programs were threatened with funding cuts and I am happy that these cuts are no longer being proposed. 
Finally, I am pleased that this legislation does not divert any funds from the District of Columbia Public School system for private school vouchers as was included in the D.C. Appropriations bill passed by the House of Representatives. 
Mr. President, unfortunately this legislation includes a number of objectionable provision which violate the principle of home rule and infringe on the rights of District residents. 
Again this year, the bill includes a ban on the use of local funds for abortions, and a ban on the use of local funds to expand health care benefits to unmarried couples. I continue in my strong opposition to these provisions. 
I also have serious concerns about the provision to cap the funds available to reimburse attorneys who represent children who obtain special education placements in hearing sunder the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. This provision will seriously inhibit the ability of children with special needs to obtain their legal right to an education. 
I am disappointed by the inclusion of a provision that prohibits the District from using funds to provide assistance to any civil action to require Congress to provide the District of Columbia with voting representation. 
The bill also includes a repeal of a recently enacted residency requirement, a matter of some controversy. 
I know that the Administration strongly objects to several provisions in the bill, including a ban on funds to organizations that participate in needle exchange programs. 
All of these provisions are unnecessary and inappropriate intrusions into the District's own priorities and the rights of its citizens. 
Overall, I support the proposed allocation of funds for the District of Columbia, but I am disappointed by the many inappropriate riders in this legislation. Without these provisions, this would have been a much better bill. 
Again, I would like to recognize Chairman Faircloth, and to acknowledge the hard work of the staff for this bill: Mary Beth Nethercutt of the Majority Staff, Minority Deputy Staff Director, Terry Sauvain; Liz Blevins and Neyla Arnas of the Committee staff; and Danielle Drissel of my legislative staff. 
I would especially like to express my appreciation to Senator Byrd, the Ranking Democrat of the Committee on Appropriations, for assigning his Deputy Staff Director, Terry Sauvain, to serve as Minority Clerk of the D.C. Appropriations Subcommittee. Terry is a long time appropriations staff member who is a consummate professional and a pleasure to work with, and I have really enjoyed and counted on his advice and council.

 Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am deeply disappointed that the Senate appears likely to adjourn for the year without acting on the nomination of Richard Paez to the United States Court of Appeals in the Ninth Circuit. The nomination has been pending--incredibly--for almost three years. 
I am very proud to say I have supported Judge Paez for over five years. I first had the pleasure of recommending Judge Paez to the President in August of 1993 for the U.S. District Court in the Central District of California, where he currently presides. I introduced him at his hearing for the District Court seat in 1994, and was so proud that the Senate confirmed him that same year. 
Judge Paez' confirmation that day was a historic moment. Judge Paez became the first Mexican American to serve as a federal trial judge in Los Angeles. He has been serving with distinction since, and continues to be widely respected. 
Concerned that Judge Paez' nomination to the appellate court was in danger of not being voted on in this Congress, I wrote a letter to the Majority Leader on September 3, 1998, strongly urging that he bring up this nomination before the full Senate. If the Senate had voted, I am confident that it would have found Judge Paez to be exceptionally well qualified to serve on the U.S. Court of Appeals and would have confirmed him once again. 
Judge Paez' record, both on the bench as well as before the Senate Judiciary Committee, once for his district court nomination, and twice for his appellate court nomination, supports the elevation of Judge Paez to the U.S. Court of Appeals. 
For 12 years, Judge Paez served on the Los Angeles Municipal Court, which is one of the largest metropolitan courts in the country. A recognized leader, his colleagues elected him to serve as both Supervising Judge and Presiding Judge. 
Judge Paez was elected Chair of the L.A. County Municipal Court Judges Association, and in 1991, he was appointed by California Supreme Court Chief Justice Malcolm Lucas to the first of two terms on the prestigious California Judicial Council, which provides policy direction to the courts, to the governor, and to the legislature, concerning court practices procedures, and its administration. 
Judge Paez is supported by Sheriff Sherman Block of Los Angeles County, and Sheldon Sloan who is a former federal judge and is the former president of the Los Angeles County Bar Association. 
Representative James Rogan of California has also written in support of Judge Paez. Representative Rogan was a his colleague when they both served on the Municipal Court in Los Angeles County. Representative Rogan states `[h]is character and integrity have never been questioned. He is an accomplished attorney and a respected jurist.' 
Gil Garcetti, the District Attorney for the County of Los Angeles, supports Judge Paez, and states his `broad federal and local criminal justice experience is very meaningful and should favor a positive vote for confirmation.' 
James Hahn, the Los Angeles City Attorney, wrote in support of Judge Paez that `his ethical standards are of the highest caliber and his judicial temperament makes him one of the most pleasant judges to deal with.' 
Peter Brodie, the president of the Association of the Los Angeles Deputy Sheriffs, a 6,000 member organization, supports Judge Paez. 
The commissioner of the Department of California Highway Patrol says `Judge Paez' education, experience, and desire to serve make him extremely well-qualified to serve on the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. His character and integrity are impeccable.' 
Judge Paez was questioned about his views of Proposition 209 in California. On that issue, I would just cite the opinion of H. Walter Croskey, Associate Justice of the Court of Appeals in Los Angeles, who in his letter of support for Richard Paez' nomination, wrote: `Based on my own knowledge of his personal integrity and his long and distinguished judicial career, I have no concern that Judge Paez will ever do anything other than approach each case which comes before him on the merits and decide it in accordance with established law and settled principles. You cannot ask more of any judge.' 
Judge Paez is a federal judge who is widely acclaimed in the legal community and is eminently qualified for the US Court of Appeals. It is a great loss to the country and our judicial system that the Senate failed to confirm his nomination.

Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am very happy to finally have the opportunity to come to the floor today and vote on the nomination of Professor William Fletcher to the U.S. Court of Appeals in the Ninth Circuit. I urge my colleagues in the Senate to vote for Professor Fletcher, who is eminently qualified to serve on the federal appeals court. Professor Fletcher was first nominated on April 26, 1995. He had a hearing and was reported out in May of 1996, and has been patiently waiting for a debate and vote on his nomination ever since. 
Some members of the Senate oppose this nomination because his mother sits on this court. However, his mother, the Honorable Betty Fletcher, has already agreed to take senior status and not sit on panels with her son if he is confirmed. So, again, I am very happy to once again exercise my duties as a U.S. Senator and cast a vote on the nomination of a federal judge. 
To give a little history, the 104th Congress never acted on Professor Fletcher's nomination the first time, so he had to be renominated on January 7, 1997. He waited more than a year for a second hearing, and has continued to wait for a confirmation vote, until today. One look at his record, and I am sure my colleagues will see that Professor Fletcher is eminently qualified to sit on the federal bench, and deserves swift Senate confirmation. 
In 1968, Professor William Fletcher received his undergraduate degree, magna cum laude, from Harvard College. He spent the next two years at Oxford University on a Rhodes Scholarship, receiving another B.A. in 1970. After Oxford, he spent the following two years on active duty military service in the United States Navy. He was honorably discharged as a Lieutenant in 1972. Professor Fletcher then attended Yale Law School, graduating in 1975. While at Yale, he was a member of the Yale Law Journal. 
After graduating from law school, Professor Fletcher clerked for a year for U.S. District Judge Stanely A. Weigel in the Northern District of California, and another year for U.S. Supreme Court Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. He began teaching at the University of California, Berkeley, School of Law, also known as Boalt Hall, in the fall of 1977, immediately after his second clerkship. While at Boalt Hall, Professor Fletcher has been teaching a broad range of courses, including Property, Administrative Law, Conflicts, Remedies, and Constitutional Law. 
Professor Fletcher is widely praised by his students and his fellow academics for his fair-minded and balanced approach to legal problems. He promises to bring the same careful fair-mindedness to the federal bench. 
I believe professor Fletcher will make an exceptional addition to the federal bench. I believe his intelligence, broad experience, and professional service qualify him to sit on the federal bench with great distinction. I am sure my Senate colleagues will be equally impressed, and I urge my colleagues to vote for his confirmation.  
Mr. SESSIONS addressed the Chair.

 Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, a little more than a year ago serious financial problems began to arise in Thailand. What began in Thailand, however, quickly spread to other Asian financial markets like Indonesia, South Korea, and even Hong Kong and Japan. In recent months, we have seen this financial crisis creep into other economies around the world, most notably, perhaps, Russia and Brazil. This crisis is not just about Asia, Russia or Latin America, however; it's about the U.S. as well. 
In today's increasingly intertwined global economy, the U.S. has an important national interest in working to stabilize the economies of its trading partners around the world. It is the U.S. that ultimately stands to lose if other economies fail--economies that are markets for our products. Reductions in Asian purchasing power or Latin American purchasing power mean lower profits for U.S. companies operating in those markets and fewer high-paying jobs in U.S. export industries. 
East Asian nations, for example, are important trading partners for the U.S. U.S. exports to East Asia accounted for 28 percent of all American merchandise exports in 1996. This number far exceeds the 9.2 percent of exports that went to Mexico, and even the 21.4 percent that went to Canada. 
Brazil, Latin America's largest economy, is also an important market for the U.S. Brazil is the U.S.' 11th-largest export market with $16 billion in sales last year. Moreover, and perhaps more important, Brazil is one of the few major trading partners with whom the U.S. has a positive balance of trade. U.S. companies' exports to Brazil grew 25% last year and are now roughly five times the value of Russia's before Russia's crash. 
I want to elaborate a little on the importance of the stability of the Brazilian economy to the U.S. And in do doing, I think it is important to remember that the U.S. is not an economic island unto itself. We are truly part of an interdependent global economy. 
Capital flows freely, without regard to geographical boundaries and to places we couldn't have imagined even 5 or 10 years ago. One of the places where a substantial amount of that capital has been flowing over the past 5 years or so is Brazil. In fact, U.S. investments in Brazil now exceed the U.S. investments in Mexico. 
Largely as a result of the reforms adopted during the administration of President Fernando Henrique Cardoso, Brazil has emerged from its so-called `Lost Decade' of the eighties. During that decade, Brazil's economy languished in inflation and stagnation. That inflation and stagnation continued into the mid-nineties, and reached as high as 2,700 percent in 1994. 
Since then, however, key infrastructure industries such as energy, telecommunications, and ports have begun modernizing and expanding. Moreover, state monopolies in oil, electricity, and telecommunications have ended, and many businesses have now been privatized. Such privatization can only mean good things for U.S. companies seeking to expand their markets. 
As the Brazilian Finance Minister in 1993 and 1994, Mr. Cardoso, along with other liberal economists, developed the `Real Plan.' This plan opened Brazil to foreign investment and pegged the Real--the Brazilian currency--to the U.S. dollar. This plan has been credited with lowering inflation from its high in 1994 to single digits this year. 
Yet, since mid-August, the economic debacles in Asia and Russia have pushed Brazil to the precipice of economic and financial collapse. The stakes for America and Americans are considerable. If the Brazilian economy fails, the financial crisis now gripping large parts of the rest of the world will be on America's doorstep. 
The huge Brazilian economy, the ninth largest in the world, is the backbone of Latin America. Economists warn that if Brazil's economy collapses, the economies of Argentina, Chile, and the rest of Latin America will be in serious peril. 
Almost twenty percent of our exports are purchased by Latin America and it is host to an increasing number of American-owned factories whose sales and profits are important contributors to the balance sheets of corporate America. A sharp reduction in the flow of this income, combined with the sharp reductions which have already occurred in Asia, would seriously imperil economic growth here in the U.S. As an economist at Salomon Smith Barney stated, `there is just no way we can allow Brazil to fail.' 
The economic crises in Asia, Brazil and other parts of the world, are potentially particularly problematic for my home state of California. California is the world's seventh largest economy, it has a gross state product of more than $1 trillion, and is by far the nation's largest state market. It exports more than any other state in the country; and thus, not surprisingly sensitive to the financial crises faced by our trading partners. 
The Asian financial crisis is illustrative of this point. Because of California's geographical proximity to Asia, and what had been Asia's rapidly expanding economies, a growing number of California's exports were, and are, going to Asia. 
Of California's top 10 export markets, 6 are Asian. Moreover, forty-four percent of all California exports are to Asia and approximately 725,000 California jobs are supported by exports to Asia. During the first quarter of 1998, however, California's exports to Japan decreased by 12 percent, exports to Singapore decreased by 14 percent, to Indonesia by almost 25 percent, and to South Korea by 40 percent. 
Although Brazil ranked 17th among California's export markets in 1997, Brazil's financial troubles do present added risks to California's ability to export goods and services. California's high 
technology companies have reportedly been building a presence in Brazil and a consumer class has emerged. Moreover, California's trade officials, and many California exporters, have said they had begun to look to the Latin American markets to offset the slowdown in Asia and help keep the state's exports growing--exports which are so vital to the California economy. 
Given this global economic interdependence, the question is--what can we, as legislators, do to help, aid, or assist in getting these distressed economies back on track? 
While there are some things we cannot do, like dictate or direct that countries follow economic practices and policies set forth by the U.S., there are things we can do. One of the things we can do, and I believe we must do, is provide technical and financial assistance to economically distressed countries through our participation in the International Monetary Fund--the IMF. 
Last September, while the Asian financial crisis was still unfolding, the IMF Executive Board agreed on quota increases for its members. The request for U.S. commitments to the IMF consists of: (1) $14.5 billion for our share of the increase in normal quota resources, and (2) $3.5 billion for U.S. participation in the New Arrangements to Borrow, an addition to the Fund's emergency credit lines for use in systemic financial crises. 
In late March, the Senate, with strong bi-partisan support, voted to include the Administration's full IMF funding request, of approximately $18 billion, in its 1998 supplemental appropriations bill. The House, however, refused to include this funding in its supplemental appropriations bill. 
Although the House did agree to provide the IMF $3.4 billion in funding on September 17, that amount is far short of the $18 billion requested by the Administration, approved by the Senate and needed to help curb the economic crisis which threatens several regions around the globe. The House and Senate are now debating this important issue, and I support and encourage Chairman Stevens' steadfast insistence that the House recede to the Senate on the issue of full IMF funding. 
The IMF is the world's largest lender of last resort and is designed to foster trade and economic growth by helping maintain stability in the international monetary system. Countries join the Fund by agreeing to a capital subscription and abiding by rules set up in the Articles of Agreement. 
The 182 member countries may borrow money from the IMF to finance short-term balance of payment deficits and to help manage more serious longer-term financial imbalances. In return, borrowing countries must adopt economic policies negotiated with IMF economists, and approved by the Executive Board, designed to ensure the underlying problems which caused the crisis are corrected. 
These policies, or conditions, are market-oriented measures that vary depending on the situation, but often focus on reducing government spending, implementing banking and financial industry reforms, and taking often painful steps to control inflation. IMF loans to its members are repaid with interest. Although, the IMF has had to restructure some of the outstanding loan balances of the poorest countries, no country has ever defaulted on its IMF loan. 
It is important to note that in addition to U.S. economic interests, U.S. national security interests are also at risk as a result of the Asian economic crisis, as well as the economic crises in Russia and in other parts of the world. Many of the countries affected by the crisis are key strategic allies.

 Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I was saddened to learn of the death of Gene Autry, a longtime Californian, earlier this afternoon. Mr. Autry will always be remembered as a singer and performer of enormous talent and appeal. First making his way onto the radio airwaves in 1928 as a singer, his career quickly broadened to include acting. He appeared in such films as `Tumbling Tumbleweeds' in 1935 and television series as `The Gene Autry Show' between 1951-1954. Perhaps his most famous song, `Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer' will forever remind us of his zest for life and gentle charm each holiday season. 
Mr. Autry succeeded in everything he undertook--radio, television, records, songwriting, movies, real estate, and business. In 1961, he bought the expansion Los Angeles Angels, renamed in 1965 as the California Angels. He maintained ownership of the team until the Walt Disney Company took operating control in 1996. 
Over the course of his life, Mr. Autry collected Western memorabilia and art. In 1988, using much of his own funding, he opened the Gene Autry Western Heritage Museum in Los Angeles' Griffith Park. I cherish every opportunity I have to visit the Heritage Museum and view treasures from the Old West. 
My most sincere condolences go out to Mrs. Autry and his entire family. Gene Autry will be missed by all, especially Californians who benefited tremendously from his works. I know that right now, the Singing Cowboy is `Back in the Saddle Again,' smiling down on us.

 Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, in the remaining days of this Congress, we can make a profound difference in the lives of American women. The Breast and Cervical Cancer Treatment Act, S. 2017, would ensure that women whose cancer is diagnosed through the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's screening program have access to the medical care they need. It would give states the option of extending Medicaid coverage to low-income, uninsured women who have been diagnosed with breast or cervical cancer through the CDC program. 
Federal legislation is needed because the patchwork of state laws does not ensure women the treatment they need. In California, the health care community and breast cancer activists mobilized behind a bill to provide breast cancer treatment to uninsured and underinsured women. The California legislature passed the bill and sent it to the Governor for his signature. Despite the bill's widespread popularity, the Governor vetoed it a few days ago. 
If we care enough about women's health to provide coverage for screenings, then we should care enough to provide treatment when those screenings find cancer. The last thing a woman should have to worry about when she is diagnosed is how she will pay for her treatment. 
The heart wrenching experience of one of my constituents shows us how important the Breast and Cervical Cancer Treatment Act is. 
Two and a half years ago, Edna Harris of Imperial Beach, California felt a lump in her breast. Like so many other women in her position, she feared it was cancerous. But Edna had another reason to worry. She was uninsured, and neither she nor her husband were employed. 
Under the CDC's Early Detection program, Edna underwent a mammogram, a fine needle biopsy, and then a full biopsy. When the results came in, her worst fear had come true: she was diagnosed with breast cancer, and told she needed surgery. The CDC program that had diagnosed her did not cover the costs of treatment. Edna was told that unless she would come up with nearly $4,000, she could not receive treatment. 
Edna's experience reveals a fatal flaw in one of our best-intentioned, and indeed most successful, programs. Low income and uninsured women who are diagnosed with cancer under the CDC program must scramble to find the money for treatment. Edna was fortunate; she ultimately was able to come up with the resources to fund her treatment. But others are not so fortunate. I have heard from women who have had to mortgage their homes or hold bake sales to pay for cancer treatment. This is unacceptable. 
The Breast and Cervical Cancer Treatment Act will help ensure that all our mothers, daughters, and sisters receive the treatment they need at one of the most vulnerable times of their lives. I urge our leadership to bring the Breast and Cervical Cancer Treatment Act to the floor this session. We owe it to the women of this country to pass this legislation before Congress adjourns.

Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am so pleased and proud to welcome Rev. Madison Shockley to the Senate today where he has just delivered the opening prayer. Reverend Shockley is pastor of the Congregational Church of Christian Fellowship, United Church of Christ in Los Angeles, CA. 
Mr. President, I had the great pleasure of attending services at his church a few weeks ago. On that particular day, we were reeling from a number of things both at home and abroad. His words were so fitting and healing. I was honored to be sitting in his congregation. 
Reverend Shockley has been a civil rights and human rights leader in Los Angeles for more than a decade. His accomplishments, his leadership and his compassion make him one of California's most respected members of the clergy. 
Following the 1992 civil unrest in Los Angeles, Reverend Shockley helped establish a 3-year program of `community conversation,' bringing together people from all racial and ethnic backgrounds, as well as leaders from across this country, to talk about the causes of unrest and tension and to bring peace and love to a community that was torn by hate and fear. 
Most recently, Pastor Shockley has authored a series of critically acclaimed articles in the Los Angeles Times covering a broad range of important social topics. I congratulate and I thank Reverend Shockley for coming all the way from California on a redeye flight, no less, which is not easy to do, and to share his prayers with us today. Our country so needs the healing message that he brings us every day. 
I yield the floor.

Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, the minimum wage is about fairness. The minimum wage should be a fair wage that rewards people for an honest day's work. 
This is the right time to provide fairness by increasing the minimum wage. Our budget is balanced and the economy remains fundamentally strong. We've created new jobs at an historically high pace of 250,000 per month. The inflation rate has averaged just 2.5 percent since 1993--the lowest rate since the Kennedy Administration--and the unemployment rate has fallen from over 7 percent in 1992 to 4.5 percent for the past two months. 
However, as the economy rolls along, it is leaving behind working families. The benefits of this strong economy are not being enjoyed by lower wage workers. 
In fact, according to a U.S. Conference of Mayors study, 38 percent of people seeking emergency food aid in 1996 held jobs--up from 23 percent in 1994. Low-paying jobs are the most-frequently cited cause of hunger today according to this survey. 
People who are willing to work should not have to turn to a soup kitchen in order to feed their families. There is no better time than now to address the problem of fair wages in this country. 
A full time minimum wage worker now earns just $10,712 per year--$2,600 below the poverty level for a family of three. To have the same purchasing power it had in 1968, the minimum wage today would have to be $7.33 an hour instead of $5.15. 
Even where the current minimum wage is a little higher in my state--$5.75. The purchasing power of the wage is over $2.00 an hour lower than the purchasing power of the minimum wage in 1968. After adjusting for inflation, today's $5.75 minimum buys 26 percent less than it did in 1968. 
Nationwide, 4.8 million families depend on the minimum wage for their sole source of income. Of the workers that would benefit from an increase, 60 percent are women--over 7 million women, and 57 percent are families in the bottom 40 percent of the income scale. 
In my state alone, almost 10 percent of the workforce would benefit from an increase in the minimum wage--nearly 1.2 million Californians and their families. 
Opponents of a minimum wage increase argue that minimum wage increases result in massive job losses. I believe--and the data prove--they are wrong. 
The National Restaurant Association claims a study found that over 146,000 restaurant jobs were lost as a result of the 1996-97 minimum wage increases. In fact, the Bureau of Labor Statistics say that as of April 1998, 187,000 new restaurant jobs were created since the minimum wage increases in 1996. 
The retail industry has many minimum wage jobs in California. Since September 1996, 97,000 retail jobs have been added in California. 
The job numbers tell the story. We have increased the minimum wage to its current level of $5.15 per hour, yet the number of unemployed Americans has dropped consistently over the past six years. Since 1992, 3 million less Americans are jobless. In fact, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, 16.3 million jobs have been created since January 1993. 
Clearly this is an issue of fairness. Everyone in this country deserves an honest, fair wage for a hard day's work. No one who is willing to work should have to take their children to a soup kitchen at night in order to feed them. 
Senator Kennedy's amendment would increase the minimum wage in two increments of 50 cents each--to $5.65 on January 1st, 1999 and to $6.15 on January 1st, 2000. After the first increase, a minimum wage earner would make about $11,700 annually. And after the second increase, a minimum wage worker would earn about $12,700 each year--still $600 below the poverty level. 
Unemployment is at historically low levels. Job creation has boomed in the past six years. There is no better time to address this problem. The time for a modest increase in the minimum wage is now.

Mrs. BOXER. I thank my colleagues very much. 
I thought we had a good debate on this yesterday, and I think the issue is pretty clear. I say to my colleagues, there is no health exception in this bill at all, which not only makes it unconstitutional, but which puts women in harm's way. And the life exception in the bill is very narrowly drawn. It is not the usual Henry Hyde language, the first version of his language or even the second. So it becomes very difficult for a physician to act to save the mother's life. 
If the President would have signed this bill, he would have been putting a woman's health and her life at risk. So I think he did the right thing to listen to the 39,000 OB/GYNs whose job it is to bring babies into the world. They oppose this bill very strongly. They call it, and I am quoting, `dangerous.' 
Proponents of this bill argue that it would prohibit a specific procedure. Many of the women who have had this procedure have been here these last few days. They have been visiting us. They were looking in our eyes. They were telling us that they believe very strongly, and their families believe, that without this procedure they could have died. They could have been made infertile. Those women look in our eyes and tell us how desperately they wanted their babies. 
One of them I introduced on the floor in a photo calls herself a conservative Republican, an antichoice, pro-life individual. She wanted her baby more than anything else and when tragedy struck, she had to have this procedure. She went to several doctors to try to find a way out, to have her baby. She had to have this procedure. She asks us, don't outlaw this without a health exception and a clear life exception. 
So why would we turn our back to hurt women who want children? Why should we presume to know more than 39,000 obstetricians and gynecologists who tell us not to tie their hands in the hospital room? 
So I know this is a very difficult issue on both sides. I know there are strong emotions on both sides. But I think the important thing to remember is, if we sustain this President's veto, which I hope we will do, there is not one woman in America who has to have any specific procedure. It is a personal decision. It is a decision based on health. If we go the route of those who are speaking to us today on the other side of the aisle, government would say to doctors, not only in this circumstance, but if they had their way--they are very honest about it, and I respect them for it--no way would abortion be legal in this country. If they had their way, government would step in where religion should be; government would step in where families should be. 
I yield the floor.

Mrs. BOXER. I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. President, I was touched by the remarks of the Senator from Michigan about having premature babies of his own. I stand here today as a mother, a grandmother, and a Senator. When my babies were born, one was born 2 months early and one was 6 weeks early. There wasn't one prayer that I didn't say, there wasn't one emotion I didn't feel. And I feel that same emotion toward any child born in that circumstance. My babies grew up healthy and they are now in their thirties, and one has made me a grandmother. 
But that is not what this debate is about. This debate is about whether we are going to protect the lives of women and whether we are going to protect the health of women. I say here today that, as long as I am here, I will work to do that. These are women who find themselves in tragic situations, traumatic situations, with a pregnancy that has gone terribly wrong. With a pregnancy which could endanger their health, their life, their fertility, and their ability to have a family in the future. 
This bill is extreme. It is dangerous for women. Why do I say that? It has no exception to protect women's health. The exception for a woman's life is very narrowly drawn. It is not the true life exception that we have used in other bills. So this bill is extreme, the bill is dangerous, and the bill turns its back on the health of women. As Senator Kerrey from Nebraska has said, clearly, it is unconstitutional. I am not just standing here because the bill is unconstitutional. Very clearly, the constitutional law that governs is Roe v. Wade, which says you must always consider the life or the health of a mother. 
I am standing here because I care about the health of women and their lives. I don't want to see this bill become the law of the land. I hope my colleagues will stand for the health and the life of women and support the President's veto. 
Roe v. Wade guarantees American women the right to choose. In the early stages of a woman's pregnancy, a State may not interfere with her right to end the pregnancy. In the midterm of a pregnancy, a State may regulate abortion procedures, but only to protect the woman's health. That is what Roe says. After viability of the fetus, when the fetus could live outside the woman either with or without life support, a State can regulate and, yes, even prohibit abortions under Roe. States can prohibit abortions after viability, except--except--for the life of the woman or the health of the woman. 
The life and the health of women must always be protected. That is the law. If we chip away at those exceptions, we endanger women because, make no mistake, this isn't the first attempt to stop a procedure and walk away from the life or health exception. There will be many attempts. There will be other procedures. There will be other ways to stop them. My colleagues on the other side are very honest about it, they want to criminalize abortion. They are honest about it and I appreciate that. I know this is just one way they are going to try to get to their ultimate goal. If we don't hold the line here on life or health, we will lose this right. 
Mr. President, the bill we are debating directly contradicts Roe. As I said, and as the Senator from Nebraska before me said, it is unconstitutional because it doesn't protect the health of the woman. It is silent. It doesn't use the words `health of the woman.' Again, it doesn't contain a true life exception. It is a very narrow life exception. So even her life would be threatened if we allow this bill to become law. 
My colleagues have quoted the fine Senator from Tennessee, Senator Frist, who is a doctor. They have quoted Surgeon General Koop. They are not OB/GYNs. 
They are not obstetrician-gynecologists. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists--those are the doctors who bring babies into the world. Those are the doctors who deal with these emergency abortions--39,000 strong. They are specialists in women's reproductive health. What do they say about this legislation? They oppose it. The organization says that this bill is--and I am quoting--`dangerous.' Who is it a danger to? It is dangerous to women. It is dangerous to the women. 
The American Medical Women's Association also firmly opposes this legislation. 
This bill, if it becomes law, will force doctors to make medical decisions that jeopardize women's health. Doctors will be afraid. They will be fearful because, if they can't meet the very narrowly drawn exception for life, but they use the procedure because they are afraid the woman would die, the doctor can go to jail for 2 years and be fined. If the woman made this decision, let's say after she learned that the baby's brain is developing outside the head, and she didn't want to carry the pregnancy to term--maybe because she was afraid that her husband might disapprove, or maybe he was an alcoholic, or maybe he was a drug addict, maybe he was estranged--the husband can also sue the doctor. He can sue, very interestingly, for psychological distress. 
When we talk to our colleagues on the other side, they don't want to include any psychological reason whatsoever when a woman has to choose. But, yes, if the man is suffering psychological distress, he can sue. 
No woman, in my opinion, wants to visit her doctor about her pregnancy--and I have done it in my own life--and see her Senator lurking over the doctor's shoulder. People often don't like us lurking over any parts of their life, let alone, let alone, when they have a medical procedure. 
I find it interesting that some Senators who come here and say there is too much government--`get government off our backs, there is too much government'--believe that they know more than physicians, OB/GYNs, who deal with real life in the real world. These Senators believe that they know better than a family about what to do in such a situation. 
No woman wants to walk into her doctor's office and see a sign that says, `Warning, Senate interference in your doctor's decisions may be hazardous to your health.' Or, `Warning, your doctor's hands are tied, he or she may not choose the best procedure for you because your Senator has decided what procedure is allowed and what procedure is not allowed.' Forget what you learned in medical school; forget about what you think is best for women; the Senator is telling you what procedure to use. 
My colleagues in the Senate say it is dangerous. Whether you have cancer, Alzheimer's, AIDS, diabetes, Parkinson's, heart disease, or any condition--all the diseases we fear--Senators should not be making decisions about what procedures should be used. Senators should not prevent a doctor from using a procedure that he or she determined was needed to protect the patient's health, to protect her from infertility, to protect her from paralysis, or worse. Government should not be in the business of eliminating safe, medical options for patients. 
We all want to know, I say to my colleagues who are loving parents, what would you do if your physician called you and said, `I just examined your daughter, and I believe her life is threatened,' or `I believe she might never have a child again, and I believe the only procedure to use is the one that Senators here want to ban.' I believe in your heart of hearts you would get down on your knees, pray to God, and say, `Save my daughter's life. Help her be able to have a child again.' I believe that. 
If you didn't, if you chose another way, that is fine for you. But don't force everyone into that situation where they don't have the option that they need. If it is all right for you to narrow your options for your daughter, for your granddaughter, I bless you for it. No one is forcing you to do that. But I think it is important that women have the option to save their lives, to save their health. And, yet, there is not one word in this about an exception for health, and it is a very narrowly drawn exception for life. 
Doctors should make medical decisions in consultation with their patients. Doctors should be free to make decisions that are best for their patients' health. When doctors take their Hippocratic oath, they say, `Do no harm.' `Do no harm.' But if in their heart they believe they are going to do harm, and it is because Senators tied their hands, they find themselves in an unacceptable situation. They can't look at the woman or her husband; they can't look in the eyes of the parents of that woman and say, `I am doing everything I can,' when they know they are afraid to use a procedure because they cannot understand the vague language that Senators put into a bill. 
If enacted, this bill could threaten the health of women across the country--our sisters, our daughters, our mothers, our nieces, our coworkers, our friends, our granddaughters. 
I want to talk about the life exception. It is very narrow. 
A woman's life would be protected only if her life is in danger by a `physical disorder, illness, or injury.' That is a quote from the bill. But if her life is in danger for any other reason, the life exception does not apply. In other words, if the pregnancy itself endangers a woman's life, the exception does not apply. Even the new Hyde language, which narrows the exception for life of a woman, acknowledges that the pregnancy itself may endanger a woman's life. But, yet, the language in this bill includes an exception only if she has a physical disorder, illness, or injury, and not any condition that arises from the pregnancy itself. 
So today I think we need to face the fact that this bill has crafted a unacceptable life exception. And for those who are voting for it who think that they are protecting the life of the woman, read it again. Read again the Henry Hyde language which we have used for many years. Even the narrow version is different than this. This is dangerous. 
Let me say again: this bill, as it is currently written, is dangerous. 
We have some people in the galleries today who have had procedures that would be banned by this bill. They are loving mothers. They are loving, loving mothers. Tiffany Benjamin is from California--this is her picture. This is her beautiful 3-year-old baby. He is now 3. He is a little younger here. She had this child after undergoing a procedure which her doctors recommended and which this bill would ban. And now she has this beautiful child. 
Also up in the gallery is Maureen Britell from the District of Columbia area, who had also had a procedure which would be banned by this bill. Maureen is a devoted mother.

Mrs. BOXER. Thank you, very much, Mr. President. I was unaware of the rule. 
I will say, then, that there are women who are here today in Congress walking the Halls. And they are looking into the eyes of Senators. They are asking them, please don't do anything. Don't do anything to jeopardize the health and the life of any woman. 
These are women who have had procedures that would be banned by this bill. These are women who are loving mothers. These are women who are begging us, begging us, to protect the lives and the health of women. 
I am going to tell you some stories. 
As I understand it, it is all right to show photographs of women. Is that correct, Mr. President? Am I permitted to show photographs of people from the State?

Mrs. BOXER. I thank the Chair. 
This is Coreen Costello. She is a registered Republican. She describes herself as very conservative. The reason I mention that is because what we are debating here today is not a partisan issue. Coreen is clear that she and her family are strongly opposed to abortion, and yet she wants us to stand with the President on this veto. 
In March of 1995, when she was 7 months pregnant with her third child, Coreen had premature contractions and was rushed to the emergency room. She discovered through an ultrasound that there was something seriously wrong with her baby. The baby, named Katherine Grace, had a deadly neurological disorder and had been unable to move inside Coreen's womb for almost 2 months. The movements Coreen had been feeling were not the healthy kicking of a baby, they were actually nothing more than bubbles and amniotic fluid which had puddled in Coreen's uterus. 
The baby had not been able to move for months. The chest cavity was unable to rise and fall. Her lungs and chest were left severely underdeveloped, almost to the point of nonexistence. Her vital organs were atrophying. The doctors told Coreen and her husband the baby was not going to survive, and they recommended terminating the pregnancy. Coreen said, `This is not an option. I will not have an abortion. I want to go into labor naturally.' She wanted the baby born on God's time. She did not want to interfere. 
The Costellos spent 2 weeks going from expert to expert. They considered many options, but they all brought severe risks. They considered inducing labor. They were told it would be impossible due to the baby's position. Also, the baby's head was so swollen with fluid, it was already larger than that of a full-term baby, so labor--let me repeat, labor--was not an option. 
They considered a cesarean section, but the doctors were adamant that the risks to her health were too great. In the end, they followed their doctor's recommendation and Coreen had an abortion procedure that my colleagues want to outlaw today. 
You just heard a story, a real story. Coreen and her husband faced a tragedy that most people never have to face. But because Coreen had access to the medical procedure her doctor felt was the safest and most appropriate, she and her husband were able to keep their dream of having a large family, and you see them here in this picture. They now have three happy, healthy children, and Coreen is due to deliver another child any day now. 
Coreen writes to us, to every Member of the Senate, I could not have had this family without this procedure. `Please, please, give other women and their families this chance,' she says. `Let us deal with our tragedies without any unnecessary interference from our Government. Leave us with our God,' she writes to us, `our families, and our trusted medical experts.' 
Now, I want to say to my colleagues this story is what happens to real people. This is real. This is a woman who says she is very conservative and she is very against abortion. But she is asking us to not do away with the procedure she had, so that other women will have the opportunity she had to bear children in the future. 
In the spring of 1994, Viki Wilson, a registered nurse, and her husband Bill, a physician, were expecting their third child. Viki was in 36th week of her pregnancy, and the nursery was ready. Her family was anticipating the arrival of their new `little one.' 
Her doctor ordered an ultrasound which detected something that all her prenatal testing had failed to detect. Approximately two-thirds of her daughter's brain had formed on the outside of her skull. 
This deformity was causing Viki's daughter to have seizures. Over time, these seizures became more and more severe. They threatened to puncture Viki's uterus. Even if Viki could carry her daughter to term, the doctors feared that her uterus would rupture in the birthing process. 
Viki could not give birth to her child without seriously jeopardizing her own health--or even her life. 
After consulting with other doctors and their clergy, Viki and her husband made the painful choice to have an abortion in order to protect Viki's health. 
In December 1996, Viki and Bill were thrilled to welcome a baby boy named Christopher into their family. 
Viki Stella was in the third trimester of her pregnancy when her son was diagnosed with nine major anomalies, including a fluid-filled cranium with no brain tissue at all, compacted flattened vertebrae, and skeletal dysplasia. Her doctors told her that the baby would never live outside of her womb. 
Viki writes `My options were extremely limited because I am diabetic and don't heal as well as other people. Waiting for normal labor to occur, inducing labor early, or having a C-section would have put my health at risk.' She continues `My only option . . . was a highly specialized, surgical abortion procedure developed for women with similar difficult conditions.' 
Though she was distraught over losing her son, Viki knew the procedure was the right option. As promised, the surgery preserved her fertility. In December 1995, she gave birth to a darling son, Nicholas. 
Viki's situation was heart wrenching. She was told her son was dying inside her. Her diabetes severely limited her medical options. Congress has no business interfering with these difficult and personal medical decisions. 
The point is, we must not go back to the days before Roe v. Wade when women died or women were maimed. We can not go back to the days when women's health was not considered important, when women's lives were not considered important. Any restrictions on women's access to abortion must always make an exception for the life and health of the woman. If we do not, as sure as I am standing here, women will die, because we know what happened before Roe. They did die. 
In response to arguments that proponents of this bill make that it bans one specific abortion procedure, I respond that we are not asking anyone to undergo any abortion procedure who has a moral problem with it. For those who think abortion is wrong, who would rather their daughters have a cesarean and believe that God would take care of it, that is what they should do. That is what is important about being pro-choice; we give people the choice. No one has to undergo any abortion procedure if they do not want to. All we are saying is, do not outlaw a procedure for every woman, because there will be women like this who will choose that procedure because they want to make sure that they can have children again. 
Now, I want to point something out. In the last debate we had on this, Senator Feinstein and I offered an amendment. It was a substitute for the bill we are debating today. And do you know what it said? It said that we oppose all late-term abortions except for life and health of the woman. We went to our Republican colleagues, and we said, `Why don't you join hands with us on this? Roe says you can restrict in the late term. We are willing to do that. Of course, we are in favor of Roe. And we will walk down this middle aisle here, hold hands across party lines here, and say no more abortion late term except for life and health.' 
They did not want to do it. And when I asked them why, they were honest. They said, `We don't believe women will tell the truth about the health exception. We believe they will say it is about health but in their heart it is not about that.' 
I want to challenge that today. I know that a woman in this circumstance, who has carried a child into the late term, desperately wants that baby. I have been there myself. When my babies were born prematurely, I can't even tell you the feeling that I had, that I might lose them, because in those years it was very difficult. But they made it. They hung on. 
So I know that a woman who gets to the late term is not going to lie about her health and say, `Oh, give me this abortion; it's the seventh, eighth month. I have decided against this.' That is not what a woman will do. 
The health exception is only for circumstances when there is something seriously wrong. 
So I think suggesting that a woman in the late term will not tell the truth about her health and why she is seeking an abortion is more than insulting to women. It is dispiriting. I know my colleagues could never think that of their children, their daughters, their nieces. I know they could not. Then why would they leap to that conclusion of other women? 
I strongly support passing legislation that says no late-term abortion whatsoever except to protect the life and the health of a woman. 
But I say to you that I will not support this legislation, with absolutely no health exception, and with a life exception that is very narrowly drawn. If this legislation becomes law, women like Coreen, who are pro-life and anti-abortion, but who want to protect their ability to have children in the future, may not have the chance to become pregnant again. Women who are pro-life, who are anti-abortion, may not have the chance to have a family just like Coreen Costello pictured here, yet again pregnant with her fourth child. Coreen, very conservative, writes to us: Please, please support the President's veto. 
So, I say to my friends, I know what a difficult debate this is. I know the heartfelt emotions on both sides, and I respect the heartfelt emotions on both sides. I am going to close here with a letter that each member of the Senate received from 729 rabbis. I think this is appropriate since we are going into the most holy time of the Jewish people. This is what the rabbis conclude:  
Abortion is a deeply personal issue. Women are capable of making moral decisions, often in consultation with their clergy, families and physicians, on whether or not to have an abortion. We believe that religious matters are best left to religious communities, not politicians. . . . We urge you to vote to sustain President Clinton's veto.

Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I said it was a short amendment. It is in fact a short amendment. It is a very straightforward amendment. It would actually strike a rider that has been placed in this bill that deals with oil royalty payments that are due Federal taxpayers. 
Mr. President, Senator Bumpers, Senator Durbin, Senator Daschle and Senator Wellstone are joining me today to offer an amendment to repeal a special interest rider that has been attached to the Interior appropriations bill. And I think, to put it in very, very straightforward terms, the taxpayers are being robbed. Now, that is a pretty strong statement, but I can back it up. They are being robbed to the tune of $5.5 million a month, and that is a lot of money, Mr. President. It adds up real fast to many, many millions of dollars, and over years, hundreds of millions of dollars. 
If any one of us were standing outside on the street and we saw someone's purse being snatched, and we saw somebody grab that purse and take the money out and pocket it, we would act like good Samaritans and we would say that is wrong. Well, I think it is wrong when we see the most powerful companies in this country--only 5 percent of the oil companies in this country are doing this--not paying their fair share of royalty payments. 
How do I know this is a fact? Because there have been lawsuits, Mr. President. All over this country the oil companies have, in fact, settled and admitted--admitted--they underpaid their royalties. 
I am very pleased that the Senator from Illinois has wound his way over here because he and I have worked on this together, as well as Senator Bumpers and Senator Wellstone. I was very proud that in the committee my motion to remove this rider got the support of Senator Byrd. And that is because wrong is wrong and right is right. It is wrong for the powerful oil companies, with teams of lawyers, to be able to take away the rightful funds of taxpayers. 
Now, what does this rider do? 
The rider prevents the Interior Department from acting to ensure that oil companies pay their fair share of royalties for oil drilled on public lands. 
Now, if you are asking what a royalty payment is, it is very simple. It is like a rent payment. The oil companies drill on Federal land, they have to pay a royalty payment, 12.5 percent of the value of the oil that they find on Federal land. What do we do with it in the Federal Government? It goes straight to the Land and Water Conservation Fund, which is the fund that purchases parks, to the Historic Preservation Fund, and a share of it goes to the States. What do the States do with it? They do with it what State law requires. In the case of my State of California, those royalty payments go directly to the schools. 
So this amendment that I am offering, if we are fortunate enough to pass it and we can strip this rider out, will mean more money for schoolchildren and more money for the Land and Water Conservation Fund. 
Now, this royalty payment is not a tax. It is a payment that the oil companies sign on to pay. They sign on to an agreement, just as you do if you lease an apartment. It says:  
The value of production for purposes of computing royalty on production from this lease shall never be less than the fair market value of the production. 
Keep that in mind. The oil companies have signed on to a lease that says that their royalty payments `shall never be less than the fair market value of the production.' 
What has been happening? A small percentage of oil companies are paying a royalty not on the fair market value of the production, but on a made up price. A price that they, themselves, make up. I will explain that later. As a result of this phantom price system, they value the oil at a lower price than the market price. Taxpayers, therefore, are getting 12.5 percent of a lower price. Taxpayers are getting robbed, plain and simple. Only 5 percent of the oil companies are doing this, 95 percent are not. We want to make sure those 5 percent, the bad actors, pay their fair share. 
That is what our amendment will do. It will strip out a rider that says to the Interior Department, `Stop what you are doing to fix this problem.' The rider in this bill says to the Interior Department, essentially, `Stop what you are doing to fix this problem.' The Interior Department is trying to get millions of dollars back for taxpayers. They are being stopped by a rider in an appropriations bill. 
It is a very simple issue. Believe me, it will be contorted to make it look complicated, but it isn't complicated. For years, oil companies have been cheating the American taxpayers out of millions, if not billions, of dollars. The Department of Interior took action to stop the cheating. And now, the Senate Appropriations Committee, pretty much on a party line vote, said to the Interior Department, `You can't fix the problem.' What we are doing in our amendment is saying, `Yes, you can, Interior Department, fix the problem. Do it in a fair way, go after the 5 percent of the oil companies that are cheating the people. Fix the problem.' 
Now, how do we know that they are cheating? First of all, common sense will tell you. We have a chart that shows the difference between the posted price and the market price. We know that the Interior Department has already billed 12 companies over $260 million for past royalty underpayments. So we know there is a problem. The Interior Department wouldn't do that if they didn't think they had proof that there has been cheating. There have been settlements in five States on royalty underpayments. California has collected $350 million; Alaska, $2.5 billion; Texas, $17.5 million; Louisiana collected $10 million; New Mexico collected $8 million. So the States are ahead of us on this. They are suing the companies because the States know they are being cheated, and they are collecting. 
Just 2 weeks ago, Mobil Oil paid an additional $56.5 million in settlement. Now, oil companies would not have settled for these large sums of money if they truly believed they could justify their royalty payments. You don't go and say, `Here are millions of dollars. I'm really innocent, but let's just get this over with.' I don't know of any company that would turn over $56 million, or $2.5 billion, if they didn't think they were liable for it. 
Here is the issue. This chart shows ARCO as an example. This is the market price of oil in the west Texas market, in the blue on this chart. This is what ARCO said the price was. It is very easy to see the chart and see the difference, the area where we should be collecting money. Another chart shows the Koch Oil Company, the same thing. This is the market price in the blue line in the Louisiana market, and the red line is what they said the market price was. 
We also know that in February 1998 the Department of Justice intervened in a lawsuit under the False Claims Act, accusing five major oil companies of knowingly undervaluing oil extracted from public land and thus paying lower royalties. The suit was originally filed in the U.S. district court in Lufkin, TX, by three private parties. The Justice Department entered the suit because of the overwhelming evidence against the companies. These lawsuits are still pending, and the Justice Department is continuing its investigation of the remaining seven companies that have been billed by the Interior Department. Under the False Claims Act, the United States may recover, on behalf of taxpayers, three times the amount of its losses plus civil penalties. 
If anyone comes on this floor and says there is no cheating--and they will--if anyone comes on this floor and says, `There is nothing there, Senator Boxer; what is the fuss?' I will show them exactly what the fuss is all about. And that is the underpayment of royalties that the oil companies promised to pay. Remember: 
The value of production for purposes of computing royalty on production from this lease shall never be less than the fair market value of the production. 
And we know what the fair market value is because there is an open market on these prices. 
Who benefits from this rider that is on this appropriations bill that Senator Durbin, Senator Wellstone, Senator Bumpers, and I, and others are trying to remove? Who wins? Five percent of the oil companies. 
If you hear someone come on this floor and say this is an attack on small oil companies, this is an attack on the mom-and-pop oil companies, that is just not true. Five percent of the oil companies, the biggest oil companies, are the only ones who are affected by this rule; 95 percent of them are not, and there is no change. So we are talking about a rider that protects 5 percent of the oil companies--namely, the biggest oil companies in the country who make billions of dollars and who are not paying their fair share of royalties and basically have admitted it in lawsuit after lawsuit after lawsuit--maybe not technically, but when you settle for those amounts of money, you know they don't want to go to court about it.

Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, let the Record show that we have 1 1/2 pages of companies that are affected by the rule, and we literally have 34 pages of all the companies that are not affected by this rule. So we, in this amendment, are going after only the 5 percent of oil companies that are cheating the taxpayers, and 95 percent of them are unaffected by this rule. So the only one that is benefited by this rider, as it stands in the bill, is big oil. 
The delays caused by this and other riders will cost taxpayers--hold on to your hats--$82 million in taxpayer money lost by this rider--$5.5 million a month for 15 months, from June of 1998 when the rules were expected to be finalized and this problem was supposed to be taken care of. 
I would like to share with you an editorial in the USA Today about this issue. I am going to read it because I think it is worth reading. It is one thing when I say this; it is another thing when an USA Today editorial says it. 
Today's debate: oil, politics and money. 
Time to clean up big oil's slick deal with Congress. 
Industry's Effort to Avoid Paying Full Fees Hurts Taxpayers, Others. 
Imagine being able to compute your own rent payments and grocery bills, giving yourself a 3 to 10 percent discount off the market price. Over time, that would add up to really big bucks. And imagine having the political clout to make sure nothing threatened to change that cozy arrangement. 
According to government and private studies, that's the sweet deal the oil industry is fighting to protect: the right to extract crude oil from public land and pay the government not the open market price, but a lower posted price based on private deals the oil companies can manipulate for their own benefit. 
Big oil has contributed more than $35 million to national political committees and congressional candidates in that time--a modest investment in protecting the royalty pricing arrangement that's enabled the industry to pocket an extra $2 billion. 
This is USA Today speaking. I don't associate myself with that thought. I think there are people here who are not motivated by this. But I think it is interesting that that is the perception of USA Today. They go on about the lost payments: 
That's millions missing in action from the battle to reduce the Federal deficit and from accounts for the land and water conservation, historical preservation, and several Native American tribes. In addition, public schools in 24 States have been shortchanged. States use their share of Federal royalties for education funding. 
But the taxpayers have been getting the unfair end of this deal for far too long. One major producer, Atlantic Richfield, has already adopted market pricing for calculating its royalty payments. 
In other words, Atlantic Richfield has stepped out and done the right and corporate-responsible thing. 
Instead of protecting industry recalcitrants and campaign contributors, the Congress should protect the public interest. 
I want to identify and associate myself with that thought. I know colleagues believe it is in the best interest of America to stop the Interior Department from moving ahead with their rule. But if you really look at it and you see that we are being shortchanged by $6 million--$5.5 million to be exact--every month, that hurts taxpayers. As I said, it is just the same as seeing a purse being snatched and a little lady running after the criminal saying, `Give me back my money.' Well, we can do a cartoon here of the oil companies--only 5 percent of them, the bad actors here--snatching the taxpayers' purse to the tune of $66 million each and every year, and having the taxpayers say, `Wait a minute, that's ours. You signed a royalty agreement and you said it shall never be less than the fair market value of the production.' 
I know there are many others who wish to speak, Mr. President, so I will soon conclude my remarks. But I want to make one point about why this is happening. The big oil companies are so large that they have affiliates to whom they sell. The problem is that if they sell to their own affiliates, that is called a `non-arm's-length transaction.' So if I have a product to sell on the market, because I don't own an affiliate, it is a very easy way to calculate the royalty. You go out on the marketplace, sell it to the highest bidder--you know what the market price is--and you pay a royalty payment of 12.5 percent on that price. If you own your own affiliate, you can pay whatever you want. So they sell it at a lower price because they control the price, and then they go ahead and pay the royalty payment on the lower price that they control. It is very much like what the USA Today said about being able to manipulate the price. They say, `Imagine being able to compute your own rent payments and your own grocery bill.' That is a pretty good deal. 
But if you are the landlord and you pay yourself rent, you could pay yourself any amount and you won't evict yourself. That is what is happening here. They are selling the oil at a lower price because they control the affiliate, and then they pay the royalty payment on the lower price. Whereas, the oil companies that are smaller, that don't own the affiliate, have to go by the market price. 
Let's show that chart one more time. Here you have a case of a company that owns its affiliate and sells to its own affiliate at the posted price--the red line--when the market price that all the smaller companies have to pay is up here. The difference between the red and blue lines is the area of cheating. That is what we are trying to recover. 
So, Mr. President, I am honored that I have been able to offer this amendment. I am very pleased that Senator Gorton showed me great courtesy in allowing me to open up the debate this morning because it is an issue that is very important. Frankly, when it came up in the Appropriations Committee, we had to struggle to even get a minute or two to discuss it. It was almost as if people didn't want it to be discussed. I am very proud today that we now have time so Senator Durbin can speak on its behalf, as well as Senator Wellstone, and others, and some on the other side can have a chance to be heard. 
In concluding this portion of my remarks, let me thank my colleagues for their interest. Let me say that there aren't too many straightforward issues around here, and people are going to tell you this isn't straightforward. But for over 2 1/2 years the Interior Department has tried to come up with a fair way to make sure the oil companies pay their fair share of royalty payments. They have done so. 
In my next series of remarks I will read you the accolades the Interior Department is getting for the way they went about this. And what do we do in the face of finally straightening out a mess that has caused lawsuits, has meant that kids in California are not getting payments into the classroom, has meant that the Land and Water Conservation Fund and Native Indian tribes and the Historic Preservation Fund have been cheated out of funds? We get a rider that says to the Interior Department: Sorry, we don't like what you are doing. Stop short right here, and let's not do anything to recover these royalty payments. 
Mr. President, I think that is wrong. I would like to see the Interior Department be allowed to do its job and, therefore, we offer this amendment with the best of intentions to allow the Interior Department to move forward on this rule. 
I yield the floor. 
I will later participate in the debate. 
Thank you very much.  
Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.

Mrs. BOXER. I wanted to know if the Senator was aware, when the Senator from New Mexico read from the independent oil producers, the director of the Minerals Management Service sent us over an announcement that I am going to put on everyone's desk that says: 
We understand that information is being provided to Congressional Members indicating that the proposed Federal oil valuation rule will put independent oil companies out of business. This is untrue. The rule will have no impact on independents who sell on the open market. 
And it goes on that only 5 percent of the companies will be impacted. 
The reason I interrupted my friend was to see if the Senator had seen this, because I think this is the key part of the debate. We know that the companies that are impacted in fact have billions of dollars of revenue. I just wanted to make sure that Senator Durbin from Illinois had seen this, and we will be putting it on everyone's desk.

Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, as we agreed before, I will speak 5 minutes now and then I will yield 20 minutes to Senator Dorgan. 
There were many misstatements made here, but I will start from the top. The Senator from Wyoming said that he didn't see me or any Members on this side at some closed-door meetings that were held between oil companies, the Department of Interior, and Members of the Senate. 
A, I was never invited to even one of those meetings. B, had I been invited, I wouldn't have gone, because I don't think it is right for Senators to meet with regulators and companies that are being regulated by those regulators. A, I wasn't invited; and B, I wouldn't have gone, and I would have expressed my opinion as to why I declined the invitation. 
There were comments made by the Senator saying those of us who oppose the rider in this bill are antibusiness. I want to make something clear: 95 percent of the oil companies are doing right by the American people. They are paying their fair share of royalties. I applaud that. As a matter of fact, Atlantic Richfield has stepped away from the big oil companies and said, `You know what? We will be a good corporate citizen. We are going to pay the right royalty based on the market price.' 
So, please, let no one say that this Senator is antibusiness when I support 95 percent of the oil companies in this particular matter.

Mr. President, I also will read into the Record the groups that support the Boxer amendment: American Association of School Administrators, American Bioenergy Association, Americans for Clean Energy, American Wind Energy Association, Arkansas State Lands Commission, California State Lands Commission, California State Superintendent of Public Instruction, Colorado State Board of Land Commissioners, Council of Chief State School Officers, Friends of the Earth, Global Biorefineries, Inc., Montana Department of Natural Resources and Conservation, National Association of State Boards of Education, National Education Association, National Parent-Teachers Association--the PTA--National School Boards Association, The Navajo Nation, National Trust for Historic Preservation, New Mexico State Lands Commissioner, Project on Government Oversight, Public Citizen, Safe Energy Communication Council, South Dakota State Lands Commissioner, SUN DAY Campaign, Taxpayers for Common Sense, Texas State Lands Commissioner, U.S. Public Interest Research Group, The Wilderness Society, and the Washington State Lands Commissioner. 
Later, after Senator Dorgan has finished and colleagues on the other side have had a chance to speak, I want to read what the States are saying as to how they view this rule and how they support the fact that there is a process going on to make sure that the largest of the oil companies--5 percent--pay their fair share of royalty payments so that the taxpayers get what is due them. 
Those who are supporting the Boxer amendment are standing with the taxpayers. That is very, very clear. I am very honored to have been able to offer this amendment.

Mrs. BOXER. I would like to yield 10 minutes to my colleague from Arkansas, Senator Bumpers, but I want to just make a point on the comments of Senator Nickles. 
We have here a chart that shows how many meetings were held before this rule was put into place. I want to make sure that colleagues understand there were actually many, many months of proposals. That it is a fact that the purpose of this rule is not to raise additional revenue. But, if companies pay their fair share, the Mineral Management Service has shown us, if they do in fact pay the royalty payment on the market price rather than a made-up price when a company sells to its own affiliate, taxpayers will receive $66 million in additional revenue. That is why all these various schoolboards are for it and many state land commissioners. 
I wanted to point out, when the rule was beginning, there were very, very favorable comments from Louisiana, Wyoming, New Mexico, Alaska, and there is a reason for it. We see that these States have had to sue in the past, I say to my friend from Oklahoma, for the fair share of the royalty payments that they believed they were owed. And I think that the States are saying to us: `We don't want to go this route. We don't want to be litigious. We don't want to be in court every day. We want a fair rule.' I know my friend from Oklahoma wants a fair rule. The issue is, How do you go about it? Do you go about it by shutting down the ability of the Interior Department to proceed on what many in the States are saying is fair, even New Mexico? The Tax Revenue Department said, `The MMS should be commended for the effort they have made in developing oil valuation regulations that are fair to all interested parties.' 
We can see that the oil companies settled for $2.5 billion in Alaska; in New Mexico, $8 million; in California, $350 million; in Texas, $17.5 million. The fact is, oil companies are settling because they are not in a strong position. When you pay a royalty payment based on a made-up price and not a market price, you open yourself up to lawsuits. 
I also wanted to point out that if you really look at the companies that are affected by this--and we have put this in the Record--they make in the billions of dollars, and these royalty payments are a tiny percent. As a matter of fact, what we have learned is that one of the companies, Shell Oil, which would see the greatest increase in their royalty payment, that great `increase' is equal to 7-100ths of 1 percent of Shell Oil's revenue every year. 
So, we are not talking about huge sums of money to these giant oil companies. What we are really fighting about here is the principle, the issue that they should pay their fair share. And even if $66 million does not look like a lot of money to some of my colleagues, it is a lot of money when it goes into various States and into classrooms. 
I yield 10 minutes to Senator Bumpers at this time.

Mrs. BOXER. Thank you very much. 
I thank my dear colleague from Louisiana for giving us her perspective from her State. And I greatly respect it. I want to pick up on something she said. She said, `It's in nobody's interest to continue in this way.' And what is `this way'? This way is lawsuit after lawsuit after lawsuit. And she is right, we should not continue in this way. 
We have seen Louisiana sue the oil companies and collect $10 million because the oil companies are cheating on their royalty payments. They settled. The oil companies would not have settled for these large sums were they not cheating. Alaska settled for $2.5 billion; California $350 million so far; New Mexico, $8 million so far; private royalty interests $15 million so far; and Texas $17.5 million so far. 
In other words, given the current status, without a change in the rule, which Interior is trying to put into place, we will continue in this way--lawsuit after lawsuit. And no one can say--I mean, you would have to be born on another planet to say that oil companies would settle for over $2.5 billion if they had not been making a mistake on their royalty payments which they send to the taxpayers of this great Nation. 
I think the issue here is: Do we want to continue in this way, which is what the rider does? It keeps us for another 12 months, for a total delay of 15 months, in this way of litigation and lawsuit and aggravation and all the rest. 
What we are saying with our amendment is: It is time to change the way we do things. And my friends are saying, `Oh, all we need to do is meet and we'll fix it up,' and so on. `Everything will be fine. We know we can resolve this. We can negotiate it.' 
This rule started back in December of 1995. We are headed toward the end of 1998. There were 14 pubic hearings, 5 solicitations for comment, all sorts of things, to resolve this matter. The basic issue is this: Companies that sell to their affiliates are paying a royalty on a made-up price, a phantom price, rather than paying it on the fair market price--which 95 percent of the oil companies are doing. 
Just 5 percent of the oil companies are involved in this and will have to pay a fair share. It is not the mom and pop folks. It is a list here, a page and a half long, compared to 34 pages long of those unaffected. Shell makes $29 billion a year in total revenue, Exxon $134 billion. We are talking about the biggest corporations who, in fact, themselves are admitting by settling all these myriad of lawsuits, that they have not paid their fair share to the States or to the Federal Government.

Mrs. BOXER. Here is where we are. Here is the market price, the real price. You know, this is a capitalistic system. I am stunned by my friends on the other side of the aisle. I used to be a stockbroker, so I know what supply and demand means. A market price is supply and demand. It is the fair price. When the market price goes down, the royalty payment goes down. When the market price goes up, the royalty payment goes up. 
But they are not paying on the market price, these 5 percent of the companies who own their affiliates and sell to their affiliates. They make up the price and they pay a royalty on that price. How would you like to be able to do that in your life? It is a pretty sweet deal; and it is wrong. I think that the various States are saying, thank you very much to the Minerals Management Service for moving forward. All of them here are saying: We commend you. `The Minerals Management Service must be complimented,' said Wyoming's Governor in 1997. Louisiana said it, Alaska said it. 
I withhold for the remainder of the debate.

Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I have really enjoyed this debate. I was saying to Senator Gorton I thought it was very important to have it because when it was raised in committee, it was a truncated debate. This has given us a chance to really show both sides. 
I think another reason I have enjoyed the debate is because it goes to the heart and soul of why I want to be in the Senate; and that is to look out for real people, the real people who make this country go, who get up every day and go to work and save to get a car and hopefully save to get a condominium or a home and to get the American dream. 
I think there is another part of that American dream that sometimes gets overlooked, and that is our heritage; that we have much more as Americans than our personal possessions, important though they are. We own the parks. We own the waters, the coastal waters. And others cannot destroy those because they belong to us. 
I think it is important for us to note that we are talking about the most powerful oil companies--5 percent of oil companies, some of which make in the many billions of dollars. And I pointed this out before. For example, Exxon, in 1996, generated $134 billion in revenue from oil and gas. And the vast majority of the oil companies impacted by this rule are huge. The impact on Exxon, for example, would be one one-hundredth of 1 percent of their revenue. 
My friend from Texas says that is going to cause a disaster. Well, the one good thing about royalty payments, as they are owed to the hard-working Americans of this country, because it is, in fact, oil drilled on their land which they own, that we all own as Americans, is that the royalty payments go down with the price of oil. So it is very fair. And here you see, again, the lease that is signed by the oil companies wherein they promise to pay a fixed royalty which is a percentage of the value of the production, and therefore when oil prices are up, the American people get more. It is a rent that is basically paid on a floating basis depending on the market price of oil. 
Now, my friend from New Mexico, for whom I have the greatest respect and admiration, says it is very complicated to figure out what is the market price of oil. And as I said before, I was a stockbroker in a former life, and I know that oil prices are posted and listed every day. I would place into the Record this publication, `Platts Oil Price Report.' If you look at it, you will see every single day, every single market. The market price listed here reflects the price of oil. So when my colleague worries that the Interior Department is off on the wrong track, I would say I agree with the New Mexico Tax Revenue Department which said:  
The MMS should be commended for the effort they have made in developing oil valuation regulations that are fair to all interested parties. They should also be commended for recognizing an issue and following through with it to resolution, in an environment where litigation abounds, unfounded criticism is made public and political mechanisms are used to mandate positions. 
You cut through that and what they are saying is very clear, 
that the MMS is, in fact, working hard to come up with a solution to this problem. 
Now, I showed before, I think, the most telling chart of all. Mr. President, this is where we are. The oil companies sign a lease with us, the American people, promising to pay rent, in essence, for drilling on Federal lands. It is supposed to be based on market price, and here you see with ARCO in the west Texas market, the market price very clearly shown and the ARCO posted price, which is their, in essence, made-up price.

Mrs. BOXER. I thank you, Mr. President. I will take another 30 seconds and withhold. What we are going after is this difference. We think the taxpayers deserve to have the fair royalty payment paid. That is why I raise this issue.

Mrs. BOXER. There is little time remaining. I just want to say again what the USA Today editorial said, because I think it sums it up beautifully and it doesn't come up with the same conclusion that the Senator from Texas, Mr. Gramm, comes up with. It comes up with another conclusion, and that is, `Industry's effort to avoid paying full fees hurts taxpayers and others.' 
Since 1920 when Congress passed the Mineral Leasing Act, the MMS has been acting to set the rules that guide the payments of royalties. So, now, all of a sudden we have a move to say this is wrong. I think is kind of interesting, all of a sudden it is wrong, something that has been in place since 1920. This is what the MMS is supposed to do. So I think this editorial really says it. 
Imagine being able to compute your own rent payments and grocery bills, giving yourself a 3 percent to 10 percent discount off the market price. Over time, that would add up to really big bucks. And imagine having the political clout to make sure that nothing threatened to change that cozy arrangement. 
And they basically say, `Taxpayers have been getting the unfair end of this deal for far too long.' 
Mr. President, I say to Senators, we have an opportunity to end this cozy deal today. I know some of my colleagues feel they need more time, they want to work on a more fair way to collect these royalties. I cannot imagine, as someone who knows supply and demand--I am an economics major, I was a stockbroker--it is pretty simple. You have the market price. Pay the royalty based on the market price. This is a capitalistic system. We do not have industry executives sitting in and deciding what the market price is in the dead of night in the back of their corporate headquarters. These 5 percent of oil companies, the oil giants, are the ones who are getting away with thievery. Let's end it now. Support this amendment. 
I yield the floor.

Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I oppose the bill before us--S. 1981--because it would ban a perfectly legal and protected activity which was upheld in 1995 by a unanimous Supreme Court decision. The bill would ban `salting,' which occurs when efforts are made by union supporters to gain employment with nonunion employers to organize their fellow employees during non-working hours. 
This bill, I believe, is an attack on the working men and women of this country who choose to exercise their legal rights. For the first time since the enactment of the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA), employers could refuse to hire workers or could terminate workers who sought or obtained employment because they intended to engage in organizing activities. 
Although the proponents of S. 1981 contend the bill merely prevents employers from being forced to hire union organizers, the actual impact of this bill would be significantly broader. For example, under S. 1981, employers could refuse to hire pro-union applicants even if they were not paid union organizers. In addition, an employer could deny employment to an applicant whose goal was to further `another employment or agency status.' Agency status, however, is not defined. What does it mean? Since it is not defined, it could include any number of things, including the ability of women to try to organize for an on-site day care center. 
The proponents of S. 1981 also contend the bill is necessary in order to prevent workers from gaining employment for the purpose of destroying an employer's business. I agree, of course, that an employer should not be forced to hire a worker who seeks employment with the intention or purpose of destroying the employer's business. In fact, however, employers already have tools at their disposal to deal with employees who are disrupting an employer's business or who are not properly carrying out their job responsibilities. Such workers can be disciplined or even discharged.

Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I strongly support the McCain-Feingold amendment to reform the federal campaign finance system. 
It is clear that a majority of the United States Senate supports the McCain-Feingold amendment. I urge senators to stop filibustering this extremely important matter, and let us pass the plan and send a bill to the president. 
I want to explain what the amendment does and the kinds of abuses of the system that it would prevent. 
First, it bans unlimited `soft money' contributions, which are contributions to national political committees like the Republican and Democratic National Committees. 
Under current law, `soft money' contributions are unlimited and virtually unregulated. This means that a corporation with an interest in legislation pending in Congress--such as an oil company--can give hundreds of thousands of dollars to the national political parties in an attempt to influence the outcome of the legislation. 
The McCain-Feingold amendment would shut down the special interest money machine by imposing limits on contributions to the national political parties. 
Second, the McCain-Feingold amendment bans attack advertising disguised as `issue ads' by corporations and unions within 60 days of an election. The amendment also requires others--individuals and nonprofit organizations--to disclose their contributors and expenditures for these ads. 
Current law allows anyone to launch vicious attacks against candidates and not disclose their true identity or the sources of their contributions, as long as the ad doesn't say `vote for' or `vote against' the candidate. 
For example, a group of tobacco companies can get together, form a phony organization called `Citizens for Good Government', and have that `organization' spend millions of dollars for television ads attacking a congressional candidate who supports tougher tobacco laws. And those companies never have to disclose what they did. 
This isn't just a hypothetical: In my own state, outside special interest groups regularly spend millions of dollars attacking California congressional candidates, often leaving those candidates mere spectators in their own election campaigns. 
The amendment prohibits corporations and unions from buying these stealth attack ads, and anyone else--individuals and nonprofit organizations--has to disclose what they are doing. 
Third, the amendment fixes a major problem in the law governing `independent expenditures', which are efforts on behalf of a candidate by someone not affiliated with that candidate's campaign. 
Under current law, a political party can make `independent expenditures' on behalf of a candidate at the same time it is making expenditures that are coordinated with the candidate's campaign. Mr. President, this is an absurd situation! Clearly, a political party can't--at the same time, with the same political operatives, from the same office--be both `independent of' and `coordinate with' a political campaign! 
The McCain-Feingold amendment allows a political party to do only one or the other: If the party makes `independent expenditures', it can't also make `coordinated' expenditures for the campaign. 
Finally, the amendment requires faster and more complete disclosure of contributions to campaigns. 
Mr. President, for these reasons, I urge my colleagues to vote for cloture on this amendment and move to passage so that we can send a bill to the president and make these changes in our campaign finance system.  
Mr. FEINGOLD addressed the Chair.

Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Missouri for his eloquent remarks, and I thank both Senators for introducing this resolution. 
I rise to salute a native son of California, a man who grew up in the playing fields of southern California, a graduate of California public schools and honed his skills at the University of Southern California and developed into a mature professional in Oakland, CA, where I saw him play many a game; a man who has since settled in Missouri, but will always remain a favorite son of California; a man who brought immense talent, hard work, energy, enthusiasm and, above all, dignity and grace to one of America's most revered institutions. 
I grew up, when I was a kid, six blocks from a Major League ballpark. I heard the sound of those home runs all through the years I was growing up. I went to many a game and sat in the bleachers. I am a baseball fan. Yet, I haven't seen such excitement in so many years that we have seen in the last month or so. 
This man has really helped reinvigorate the game of baseball, further enshrining it as our national pastime. He has thrilled countless lifelong fans of baseball, and he has made millions of new fans who knew very little about the game. This is a man who has put us in touch with baseball heroes of the past, and he has inspired baseball heroes of the future--a giant of a man, playing a game that we learned to love as children, and who has made us all feel like little kids again at a time when we need that every once in a while. Of course, I speak of Mark McGwire. 
I think it is also important to recognize the Cubs' Sammy Sosa. Both of these men have pursued Babe Ruth's and Roger Maris' home run records, and they did it under intense pressure, but with grace and joy, rooting for each other, appreciating their fan support, and infecting us all with good humor, poise and good sportsmanship. 
Today is a day of heroes--one particular hero, Mark McGwire. I wanted to say on behalf of all of California--and I know Senator Feinstein joins me in this--that we are very proud of Mark McGwire. 
In closing, I want to say that it is hard to join a nexus between one thing and another here. But I have two heroes here today on the floor of the Senate--Russ Feingold and John McCain--because I am really proud of the way they have pursued their goal, a goal that I think will make this democracy stronger, a goal of good, solid campaign finance reform. 
On the one hand, we laud the baseball heroes. I wanted to laud a couple of Senate heroes of mine on campaign finance reform. 
Let me again thank the Senators from Missouri for giving us a chance to get to see this praise in writing in the Record for all time. 
Thank you. I yield the floor.

 Mr. BOXER. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Congressman Nick Lampson of Texas today in introducing the Sherrice Iverson Act. This `good samaritan' legislation is named in honor of the 7-year old girl molested and murdered in a Nevada casino in May of 1997, while a bystander did nothing. 
Nevada authorities report this vicious attack was at least partially witnessed by David Cash, Jr. the best friend of the assailant. Mr. Cash was in a position to stop this brutal murder, yet he did nothing. He then failed to report the crime to the proper authorities. Nevada officials considered prosecuting Mr. Cash for his callous disregard of human life but found no legal basis for a criminal prosecution. 
Nevada officials had no legal recourse because the state does not have a `good Samaritan' law requiring witnesses to report crimes to the proper authorities. 
This is wrong and we need to address that aspect of our laws. That is exactly what the Service Iverson Act does. It requires that states pass laws requiring witnesses of child sexual abuse to report that crime to the police. If they do not pass such laws, states would become ineligible for federal Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act funds. The details of these laws, including the penalties imposed, are left to the states. 
The bill only requires people to report the crimes they witness; it does not require them to intervene in potentially dangerous situations. Only two states, Vermont and Minnesota, currently have such `good samaritan' laws.

Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I hope all my colleagues had a good Labor Day at home with their constituents. I want to say that I had the real pleasure of being with hundreds of people all over the great State of California with the Lieutenant Governor this Labor Day. And it was very uplifting to be with the people who are moving our country forward, because every day they get up and put one foot in front of the other, and they work, they take care of their families, and they build this country. 
So it was, indeed, a very good day, and I think a day that gave a lot of us perspective as to why we are here and what our real interests should be in terms of making sure that this economic expansion continues, and that every child, regardless of station, has a chance at the American dream. 
Mr. President, last week, Senator Lieberman made a very thoughtful speech on the Senate floor in which he expressed his `deep disappointment and personal anger' concerning the President's improper behavior. 
Senator Lieberman then laid out the process by which the Senate can go on record in an official expression of disapproval. 
When I was asked how I felt about that, I expressed agreement with Senator Lieberman and with his understanding of the options that are before this body. 
I would like to reiterate today what I have said about this matter since January. At that time I put my faith in the process, which I said would lead to the truth. The process is in fact leading to the truth, and the process is continuing. 
In 1983, when I served in the House of Representatives, we had such a process in place when I voted to censure two colleagues--one a Democrat and one a Republican--for relationships that involved interns; we had a process in place in 1990, again, when a House colleague was reprimanded for his conduct. 
Unfortunately, we did not have such a process in place in 1991, when a Supreme Court nominee was about to be confirmed with not so much as a look at allegations of sexual harassment. And in 1995, the integrity of the Senate process was being compromised to keep such charges by 18 women secret, rather than following the normal course of open public hearings. We also learned that the military routinely ignored similar complaints. 
So despite the difficulty of all of those incidents--and they were all very difficult--I am proud that many women in Congress have worked to make sure that improper relationships in the workplace are no longer swept under the rug. We certainly know about the President's relationship. It was wrong. It was indefensible, and as Senator Lieberman has said, the relationship was immoral. The President has now agreed with that assessment. I fervently wish he had seen it that way before the relationship started. And in any case, he should have taken responsibility much earlier. 
This President has led us out of the worst recession since the Great Depression. He has led us to a balanced budget--the first one in 30 years. And in my home State we have seen 1.4 million new jobs, 100,000 new businesses, and a decline in crime of 28 percent. 
I will always be grateful to the President for his visionary public policy in so many areas, and so will the people of California. I fervently hope that while the process moves forward we can continue to work with President Clinton to keep the country moving in the right direction. The people want us to do that, and I think we should do that. 
I don't believe there are differences in this body about the immorality of the President's relationship with an intern. 
As I said, the President himself agreed with Senator Lieberman's comments. 
We have a process in place to deal with the President's morality as it relates to an improper relationship. I would like to ask us today to also set our agenda to deal with public policy morality. 
I want to explain what I mean by that. 
Is it moral for an HMO to deny a child desperately needing care? 
I spoke at a press conference the other day about one of my constituents, a little girl, who is undergoing chemotherapy treatment. She is very sick and she has severe nausea and vomiting from the procedure. The HMO denied the parents $54 for a prescription to take away her nausea and vomiting while the CEO of that company was drawing down tens of millions of dollars in salary. I don't think that is moral. 
I want to see us pass a Patients' Bill of Rights with teeth in it to deal with that. 
Is it moral that 14 children every day die from gunshot wounds in America? Fourteen children every day. Let's pass sensible gun laws that do not infringe on people's rights but make our country safer. 
Is it moral not to fund three out of four approved NIH grants? That is what happens today. The NIH budget is squeezed. We need to do more. Our people are sick. They worry about cancer, Alzheimer's--all the diseases that plague us today. Let's double the Federal commitment to help research within the context of a balanced budget, and then tell our people we are doing all we can. That would be the moral thing to do. 
Is it moral for special interests to give unlimited funds of money to a political campaign? We could stop that. Let's pass the McCain-Feingold campaign finance reform laws. That would help solve the problem. 
Is it moral to have children attending schools where ceiling tiles fall on their heads? 
I just visited such a school in Sacramento--an old school. I had to run out of there literally choking on the must and the mildew in the room. We need an education plan to help all of our children learn. 
Is it moral to leave our kids at home in empty houses or to join gangs because they are so lonely after school? We know the juvenile crime rate goes just straight up like this after school, and we know that afterschool programs work. Let's pass a program at least to fund 500 of those afterschool programs. 
So my point today is this: In the Senate and in our own way we must strive for private morality, and we also should strive for public morality. 
Mr. President, we have so much work to do. But I know we can do good things for the people of this country if we have the will to move forward to address the many moral questions facing us--the moral questions on the private side, and the moral questions on the public side. 
So, again, as we reflect on the situation as it confronts us, let's remember to do our best on both sides of the equation--private morality, absolutely; and public morality, absolutely. 
Thank you very much, Mr. President. 
I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mrs. BOXER. I thank my leader for making what I think is a very rational request, that we take up a Patients' Bill of Rights and we have the option of amending such a bill so that we can in fact help the majority of the American people who are telling us pretty unequivocally here they want quality health care. I have a brief comment and then a question for my colleague and my leader. 
Mr. Leader, I want you to know about a story in my State. There are so many of them, and I have told many of them on the floor. This particular story, I think, is quite poignant because it has a good ending to it. But it makes a very important point and I think our Presiding Officer who is sitting in the Chair, our President of the day, would be interested in this as a physician. 
A little girl named Carly Christie got a very rare type of cancer many years ago, about 9 years ago. It required some very delicate surgery that only a couple of specialists had ever really performed before. It was a cancerous tumor on her kidney. Her dad went to the HMO and said, `Look, I know the doctors who know how to do this and I am going to go and have this operation done.' 
The HMO said, `No, you are not. We have a general surgeon, and the general surgeon can do this operation.' 
`Well, has the general surgeon ever done such an operation before?' 
`No.' 
And Mr. Christie said, `This is my flesh and blood. This is my child. I want her to live. I need to go to someone, a specialist, who knows how to do this operation.' 
They said, `No.' 
He got the money, $50,000, I tell my leader, and she got the surgery. And now, many years later--she was 9 at the time; she is 14--she is cancer free. 
What would have happened to that little girl if she hadn't had an experienced specialist? I ask my leader, the bill we want to bring before this body, wouldn't that ensure that any little Carly or any other child, or any man or woman, would be able to get that specialist? I ask my colleague on that point.

 Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise today to commend the exemplary work of the Gemological Institute of America (GIA) and the GIA Gem Laboratory. 
GIA has been the nation's leader in gemology training and education since 1931, conducting valuable research and establishing standards upon which purchasers of gems in the United States and abroad have come to rely. 
The Federal Trade Commission (FTC), in establishing regulations concerning gems that are the subject of trade in the United States, adopted standards developed by GIA. 
GIA's Gem Laboratory--located in New York City and Carlsbad, California--operates to protect the public from misrepresentation of gems, to assist in the recovery of stolen property, and to provide information useful in the prosecution of criminals involved in gem fraud or theft. 
The Gem Laboratory is also the main body applying the FTC's regulations on gems (26 CFR Part 23), such that consumers have a means of determining whether the products they purchase are, in fact, the real thing. It serves an essential role in identifying gems and in detecting synthetics as well as colored, doctored, or treated gems being marketed as natural and in deterring those who might attempt to profit by misrepresenting their goods to American consumers. 
The Laboratory can achieve these purposes only because it is responsible for identifying and/or testing a large proportion of the significant gems purchased by consumers in the United States. 
The Laboratory's extensive computerized gem database enables it to identify stolen gems that it had previously tested and inhibits the fencing of stolen gems, thereby providing an important deterrent to gem theft. 
At the request of the United States Customs Service and pursuant to licensing by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, the Gem Laboratory also tests for irradiated gems posing a health risk to the American public. 
The Federal Bureau of Investigation and local law enforcement agencies rely on the Gem Laboratory for assistance in solving crimes involving gems. The Laboratory has been instrumental in solving many such crimes, providing crucial evidence and expert testimony essential to their successful prosecution. 
Mr. President, I commend GIA and the GIA Gem Laboratory for their contribution to the protection of the consumer. Through its work, the Gem Laboratory significantly lessens the burdens of the federal government that would otherwise have to be borne by the FTC, the FBI, the Customs Service, and other government agencies.

 Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, on July 11, I had the pleasure of visiting the Santa Ana Police Department to observe its community policing program. Santa Ana is the largest city in Orange County and the ninth largest city in the State of California. Thanks in part to their aggressive community policing program, violent crime in Santa Ana has fallen dramatically. 
According to the FBI, violent crime in Santa Ana has dropped 39 percent since 1992; homicides alone are down more than 60 percent, property crimes have dropped 51 percent, and grand theft is down 43 percent. 
As one of the first recipients of a Department of Justice Law Enforcement Assistance Administration grant over twenty years ago, the Santa Ana Police Department has been a leader in community policing programs. The Santa Ana Police Department initiated a test program called Community Oriented Policing (COP), designed to create greater interaction between the police department and the community. 
The COP philosophy utilizes two strategies: prevention and response. The prevention element aims to remove many of the causes of crime in a community. The Santa Ana Police Department, for example, adopted the `Broken Windows' philosophy of James Wilson and George Kelling. This theory states that minor crimes, disorder, and community disrepair breed crime. Santa Ana put this theory to the test with its `Operation: Round Up' program. By making cosmetic improvements to crime-ridden neighborhoods--repairing homes and removing abandoned cars for example--and by prosecuting minor violations, the police sent a strong message that crime of any and all magnitude is not acceptable. As a result, the `Operation: Round Up' program was able to eliminate a notorious street gang and improve the infrastructure and appearance of the neighborhood. 
The response element of the COP philosophy focuses on improved reaction to crime and effective use of police resources. As part of the COPS MORE 96 grant from the Department of Justice, the city received a $1.8 million grant that allowed for the purchase of 150 laptop computers for its police department, which do the work of 55 police officers. These computers enable officers to file police reports from the field electronically, allowing them to patrol the community longer. The increase in the number of available officers has decreased the number of calls for assistance. The COP program has allowed the Santa Ana Police Department to concentrate all available resources on fighting and preventing crime. 
Mr. President, I am so pleased to recognize Police Chief Paul Walters and the entire Santa Ana Police Department for providing outstanding service to the people of California. Their actions serve as a model for other communities to follow. I hope Congress will continue to help communities such as Santa Ana improve the quality of life for its citizens.

Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I oppose the DeWine amendment, which will curb the rights of women who work for the federal government to obtain abortion services through their health insurance. I strongly urge my colleagues to vote against this amendment. 
Over one million women of reproductive age rely on the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program for their medical coverage. This amendment will stop them from using their own insurance to exercise their right to choose an abortion. The exceptions in this ban are inadequate to protect the rights of women. 
Women who are employed by the Federal Government work hard. They pay for their health premiums out of their own pockets. They deserve the same, full range of reproductive health benefits as women who work in the private sector. 
The question is: Should female federal employees or their dependents be treated the same as other women in the work force, or should they be treated differently, singled out, with their rights taken away from them? 
In 1993 and 1994, Congress voted to permit federal employees to choose a health care plan that covered abortion. Unfortunately, this Republican Congress over-turned that right. 
This bill provides funding for the full range of health benefits through the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program. We should ensure that these benefits remain in the bill by opposing this amendment. 
Anti-choice forces are chipping away at the right of women in this country to obtain safe, legal abortions. They are making a woman's ability to exercise that choice dependent on the amount of her paycheck and the employer who signs it. It's simply unjust. 
If there were an amendment to stop a man who happens to work for the Federal Government from getting a perfectly legal medical procedure, one that might protect his health, there would be an uproar on this floor. People would say, how dare you do that to the men of this country? Why not treat the men who work for the Federal Government the same way we treat men who work in the private sector? 
Decisions about health care--including reproductive health care--should be made by patients and their doctors--not by HMO bureaucrats or politicians. Decisions about abortion are tough, personal, and private. We need to trust women to make that choice. 
Let's ensure that all federal employees have the rights, the protections, and the healthcare coverage they deserve. I urge my colleagues to vote `no' on this amendment.

Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I strongly support my colleague's amendment to require Federal Employee Health Benefits plans to treat prescription contraceptives the same as all other covered drugs. This amendment is critical to improving both equity and health care for federal employees. 
The Federal Employee Health Benefits plans should be a model for health insurance coverage for all Americans. Unfortunately, they fall far short when it comes to reproductive health. Ten percent of Federal Employee Health Benefits plans have no coverage for contraception. 81 percent of plans do not cover the range of contraceptive care for women, including the most commonly used reversible contraceptives, including (oral contraceptives, diaphragm, IUD, Depo-Provera, and Norplant. 
This is an issue of gender equity. Women spend 68 percent more in out-of-pocket costs for health care than men. Much of this difference is due to reproductive health costs. For many women, contraceptives cost an additional $400 or more each year. By passing this amendment, we can take an important step toward eliminating this economic disparity. 
I note with some concern that this amendment allows certain plans to exempt themselves from complying with this requirement. This exemption will limit the scope of these gains for American women. It was my hope that we could ensure contraceptive parity for all, not some. 
I urge my colleagues to continue to pursue that aim, but I acknowledge that effort must be left for another day. 
I urge my colleagues to vote `yes' for this amendment, `yes' for equity, and `yes' for the reproductive health of our Federal employees.

Mrs. BOXER. Thank you, Mr. President. I rise today to say that what we have in front of us is a major rewrite of the Guest Worker Program. This particular proposal has had no hearings. 
I have talked with my colleagues, of whom I am very fond, on both sides of the issue, and I am getting different responses. One says it will vastly increase illegal immigration; the other says it will control it. 
One says it will depress agricultural workers' wages; and the other one says, no, it is going to get better. 
One says it will take away housing from farm workers; the other says it will get better. 
What is the impact on American workers? We don't know. I say to my good friends on both sides, something like this ought not be rushed away. I have 60 seconds to talk. My colleague from California, who has been a leader on this issue, is going to have 4 minutes or 5 minutes. This is wrong. We really ought to do this in the right way: send it to the committee and have a full hearing. 
I yield back my time to my colleague. I thank him.

Mrs. BOXER. Thank you very much, Mr. President. 
The amendment in the second degree I have just sent to the desk requires that all handguns sold in the United States include a child safety lock. I am offering this amendment for one extremely simple reason: to keep our children safe. 
The Centers for Disease Control reports that 1.2 million children have access to guns in the home, and a survey sponsored by the National Institutes of Justice found that 34 percent of handgun owners store their guns unlocked and loaded. As long as this continues to be the case, our children are not safe. 
I have on this chart just some numbers. In one year, firearms killed no children in Japan--no children; 19 in Great Britain; 57 in Germany; 109 children were killed in France; 153 children were killed in Canada; and in the United States of America, the greatest democracy in the world, the greatest nation in the world, 5,285 children have been killed. 
I know that some of my colleagues prefer that I not offer this amendment at this time. They will argue that my amendment is not germane under a strict definition of the term `germane,' and I should wait until an authorization bill reaches the floor. 
To those colleagues I say today that I have tried. For more than a year, I have waited for the Senate to consider a firearms bill or a crime bill, a juvenile justice bill, any bill to which I could attach this amendment. 
As the Senate waited, our schools have exploded in an unprecedented series of shootings, many of which involved unlocked handguns stolen from the home of a friend or family member. As we waited, Mr. President, children across the country have died violent deaths. 
I see my colleague from Illinois is here. He has worked on so many important issues, and he is working hard on this issue. 
We were together just a few weeks ago with a mother who lost a child in the Arkansas shootout. She approached the microphone and, barely audibly, told us that we have to act. She understands, better than any of us, that our kids are dying. More kids are dying in this country than any other country. And it would be so simple to lower those numbers if we could get these safety locks on these weapons. 
So we have waited. I think it is time that we stopped waiting. We have to ask ourselves, How many children must die before we decide it is time to act? We cannot wait. We cannot delay. We must act now. The safety of our children depend on it. I do not think any American wants to turn on the television and witness another one of these shootings that could have been prevented had there been a safety lock on the gun. I am not saying it would prevent every single accident. But, Mr. President, we know it would definitely prevent many of those shootings. We cannot delay. 
Of these 5,285 children who were killed by firearms, Mr. President, 440 died as a result of accidental shootings--kids, little kids, usually shot by other little kids, playing with a gun, found in their parents' bedroom or at a friend's home. That is over one child per day. 
Look at this chart, Mr. President. 
`Boy paralyzed in a gun accident. Cousin, 9, mistakenly thought he removed the bullets from the gun, police say.' 
`Avra Valley boy shot to death as his best friend handled handgun.' 
`3-year-old finds gun, kills sister.' 
You know, we cannot be so jaded that we forget about the personal tragedies every family goes through when this happens. The mother from Arkansas, Suzann Wilson, told us, `I taught my daughter so many things,' because she said that `it's a dangerous world.' She said, `I taught her never to take a ride from a stranger. I told her, when you walk down the street at night, be with a friend.' She said, `I taught her everything I thought I had to. But,' she said, `I never taught her, `Don't go outside when the fire alarm rings in school because some kid may have triggered the alarm and has a gun and is going to kill you.' 
And just listening to her words, we knew we had to act as soon as we could. I know my colleague from Illinois has been a leader in the area of the Brady bill and in the area of making parents responsible when children use a gun. All of these things together are important. And this is very important. 
Mr. President, over one child a day--more than one child a day--dies by accident because they are doing what normal children do. Normal children, they explore, they are curious; they find a gun, and they shoot it. 
I want to put back the other chart which shows those numbers one more time, because I hope Senators will take a look at these. I am going to expand on some of the stories that I talked about here. 
The 3-year-old who found a gun and killed his sister from Fort Myers, FL. Colton Hinke and his 2-year-old sister Kaile were playing in their parents' bedroom when Colton found an unlocked, loaded handgun in a drawer. A neighbor who heard the shot rushed to the scene, found Kaile on her back--her face pale, her lips blue, a small hole in her chest. She was in shock. She was rushed to the hospital, but it was too late. 
The neighbor told the Fort Myers News:  
She was a beautiful little girl. She had the biggest blue eyes. . . . The boy didn't even know what was going on. The hardest thing is that they are both innocent victims. 
A little 3-year-old brother--it is unbelievable, an accidental shooting of probably the little human being in his life he loved more than anything else. 
From Kansas City, KS, a 1-year-old Kansas City girl, shot in the head. Here it is. `1-year-old Kansas City, Kansas, girl shot in the head.' This article tells the story of a 1-year-old girl critically injured when shot in the head by her 3-year-old brother. 
Mr. President, something is desperately wrong. Their mother kept an unlocked, loaded handgun under her mattress to protect her family against intruders. But one evening, when she was changing the linens on her bed, she removed the handgun and placed it on a nightstand. It took a few seconds for the 3-year-old son to pick up the gun and shoot his little sister. 
A neighbor took the baby to the hospital and later said that the mother `had the baby all covered up, but I could see a lot of blood. I haven't seen that much blood for a long, long time.' Miraculously, Mr. President, the little girl survived. 
And from Salt Lake City, UT, `Boy Playing With Gun Shoots and Kills 13-year-old Friend.' Here it is--Salt Lake City. Three boys were playing in a Salt Lake City home when one found a loaded, unlocked handgun hidden behind the headboard in the master bedroom. You know, kids are very smart. You think you are hiding something from them, but they can find these things. They were horsing around in the bedroom and the gun fired. The victim was transported by helicopter to the hospital too late--he was declared dead an hour later. 
Mr. President, I could go on and on. I am not going to take the time of the Senate to repeat all of these stories, because to repeat a story, behind every headline, it would just take too much of the Senate's time. And the other reason is that when you keep telling these stories, you get so sad that you do not want to keep on focusing on the past. But let us talk about what we can do, what we can do to prevent similar tragedies in the future. 
My amendment does that. Again, it was carefully crafted by Senator Kohl, Senator Durbin, and myself. Just think, if the parents of those children, whose terrible stories I have told, were given a safety lock when they bought their handguns, these senseless tragedies--every one of them that I cited here--could have been avoided. 
So what is a child safety lock? And how does it work? A child safety lock is simple; it is inexpensive device, designed to prevent the use of a firearm by unauthorized users--very simple. The most common are trigger locks, which fit over the trigger of a gun; and chamber locks, which fit into a firearm's chamber, preventing it from discharging. I have seen these locks. I have used these locks. They are very, very simple to use. 
My amendment also defines lockboxes--which are storage cases designed to hold guns securely--as child safety locks. If someone does not want to put a lock physically on the gun, they can lock it in a lockbox and it will qualify under the amendment. These devices are generally locked with a key, although combination and other kinds of locks are acceptable. 
Safety locks work. But do not take my word for it. Listen to what Gun Tests magazine, a publication for gun enthusiasts, said about safety locks: 
If a lock is properly designed, it will ward off the curious fingers of those too young to handle firearms responsibly, while conveniently preserving access to guns used for self protection. 
So if you need to have the gun for self-protection, it is there. 
Even Charlton Heston, president of the National Rifle Association, expressed qualified support for safety locks during an appearance on `Meet the Press' last month. 
It is important. We all love children here. Most of us are parents; many are grandparents. I think of my 3-year-old grandson. As responsible parents we ought to make sure that these lethal weapons cannot be used by children. 
This amendment is not about taking people's guns away. It aims only to protect children while preserving a citizen's right to keep a firearm in the home for self-defense or any other legitimate purpose. 
Again, Senator Kohl actually authored this bill and many of us are cosponsors. The good news is that many of the handgun makers have decided to do this voluntarily, about 75 percent of them. This is good news. The bad news is, 25 percent have not. That means there will be 350,000 guns sold which will not be sold with a safety lock. 
If we pass this legislation, the voluntary agreement will move forward and we will make sure that those 350,000 guns that will not be covered by the voluntary agreement will be covered by a child safety lock. 
If we pass this amendment, children will live who would otherwise die as a result of accidental gun shootings. Exactly how many? I don't know; let's look at those numbers again. Out of the 5,000 deaths of children, 440 were accidents. Mr. President, I believe of those accidents, we could stop the majority. 
I am proud to stand here for the children, to protect them from safety and harm. Child safety locks will do that. I hope we will get an overwhelming vote. 
I am happy to yield to my colleague.

Mrs. BOXER. I simply say this: If ever there was a matter that was a commonsense matter, this is it. We are losing kids; 5,000 kids are dying. In my State, gunshot wounds are the No. 1 cause of death among children. So anything we can do to prevent that is worth doing. 
My colleague has shown a typical safety lock. It is not expensive. Many companies have agreed to do this voluntarily. It seems to me we need to give a boost to those others to join. This law would not adversely impact those who are voluntarily moving forward with these locks. 
I am interested to hear the argument against this because it will be hard for me to understand how we could look at this figure, say that we love our children, say that we should be protectors of our children, and still not stand up for our children. We can do it with this amendment. It isn't rocket science, it is a simple child safety lock. Just as we would keep out of the reach of our children anything dangerous, this is the only way to keep guns out of the reach of children. 
I want to thank my colleagues for their patience. I am looking forward to an overwhelming vote on this. 
I ask unanimous consent Senator Mikulski be added as a cosponsor.

Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I thank Senators Kohl and Durbin for their eloquent remarks and, again, say to my colleagues, it is Senator Kohl's bill that we essentially have here with very few changes. It almost passed the Judiciary Committee. It was defeated by a very narrow margin. 
We are going to get a vote up or down on this amendment. I am very pleased about that. 
Every single one of us on both sides of this issue absolutely love children. It is just very hard for me to understand that we cannot come together on this commonsense approach. 
This amendment does no violence to the right to own a gun, to the right to buy a gun, to the right to use a gun lawfully. It merely says that we are going to make sure that parents, when they buy a gun, have with it a safety lock that is easy to put. And I have to tell my friends and colleagues here, I know if you could meet with just one of the parents of these children who were killed accidentally, you support this amendment. 
Of the 5,285 children killed every year by gunfire, more than 440 are completely accidental deaths. And let us think about 400 kids dying accidentally every year and what that means--kids who would have grown up and had families of their own and given joy to their parents and grown to be grandparents. This is a small thing to do. I am always amazed, I say to my friends, that we cannot come together and reach across the party lines on these issues. 
I want to put into the Record a letter that I received today from the International Brotherhood of Police Officers, or IBPO. And this is what they write. This is important because these are the law enforcement officers: 
On behalf of the entire membership of the IBPO, I want to thank you for the amendment that will require that all licensed manufacturers, importers or dealers must include a separate child safety lock or locking device with each handgun purchased. The IBPO strongly endorses your legislation and looks forward to working with you on this important matter. 
The IBPO represents street cops. 
So these are cops who are on the beat and on the street. 
Police officers, the letter goes on are out in the community every day. 
By far, the most difficult part of their job is to arrive at home where a gun is left out, unsecured and tragedy has occurred. This legislation simply put will save lives. Each day in America, 16 children, age 19 and under are killed with firearms. Many of these deaths could have been avoided with a simple trigger lock attached to the gun. 
My colleagues have shown those trigger locks here. They are very inexpensive. They are very easy to use. And, yes, there is one company that makes them so you could place it on a loaded handgun. So the argument you would have to leave your gun unloaded is simply not correct. However, it should be noted that all law enforcement agencies recommend storing firearms locked, unloaded, and out of the reach of children. 
The letter from Kenneth Lyons, the National President of the IBPO, goes on to say: The Centers for Disease Control estimates that nearly 1.2 million unsupervised children have access to loaded and unlocked firearms in the home. 
Let me repeat what he writes to us: `1.2 million unsupervised children have access to loaded and unlocked firearms in the home.'  
It is because of these numbers that this legislation is needed.

Mrs. BOXER. Another letter comes to us from a heroine of mine, Sarah Brady, whose husband Jim, as you remember, was gunned down when he was the press secretary to President Reagan. She is the head of Handgun Control and writes us a letter today. 
Dear Senator Boxer: I am writing to commend you for all your efforts to ensure that every handgun sold in the United States be sold with a child safety lock or other safety device designed to prevent unauthorized use. Jim and I urge all Senators to support this amendment to the Commerce, State, Justice Appropriations. 
And she reiterates the facts that we have gone over today. 
Every day in America, 14 children, age 19 and under, are killed with firearms. Many of those deaths--accidents, suicides, and homicides--are preventable. One of the best ways of preventing these tragedies is to keep children from gaining access to a gun in the home. Public opinion surveys reveal that almost half of all households own firearms. Regrettably, a substantial number of gun owners improperly store their weapons, leaving them loaded, unlocked or both. A National Institute of Justice survey showed that 55% of all handgun owners keep their handguns loaded, and 34% keep a handgun that is loaded and unlocked. 
As Senator Kohl has said--this is recipe for disaster. Unfortunately, we know this isn't a disaster just waiting to happen at some time in the future. If you look at this collage of headlines, this is a disaster that is happening in every city in every town in every suburb. There isn't a day that goes by that I do not get something in a clip from California. And these are from around the country. So this is a disaster that is happening now. Sarah Brady quite understands this. She goes on to write: 
. . . the rate of firearm deaths among children 0 to 14 years of age is nearly twelve times higher in the U.S. than in 25 other industrialized countries combined. 
So let us look at the other chart one more time, because you can see these numbers: Zero children killed in Japan; 19 in Great Britain; 57 in Germany; 109 in France; 153 in Canada; and 5,285 children killed by handguns in a year in the United States. 
We can sit back and say, `So what.' We could sit back and say, `Oh, we just have to give another piece of paper that talks about it.' Or we can vote for this important amendment and make sure that when the parents buy the gun, it includes a child safety lock. 
Now, I think it is important to laud some of the gun companies that have decided to volunteer to put these locks on guns and sell them with those locks without a law. I think it is wonderful that they have done it. They came to the White House and they reached an agreement with the President, and we are going to see more handguns sold with these locks. 
However, the problem we have is that about 25 percent of handguns will not have these locks because the companies, including several in my state, have not agreed to this voluntary agreement. This means that about 350,000 guns every year will not be covered--350,000 guns--will not be covered by the voluntary agreement. So we are saying, good for the companies that volunteered to do this. Now let us make sure that everybody does it.

Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, what we have here is a very straightforward amendment. It simply says, when a handgun is sold, include a lock. If a customer prefers a lockbox, that is acceptable to us, that is fine. And it is endorsed by the police, one of the largest organizations of cops on the beat, Handgun Control, and Sarah Brady. 
This is something that we can do. 
We don't want to wake up in the morning and see these headlines anymore, we don't: `6-year-old Boy Shot at Friend's House.' That is in Allentown, Pennsylvania. In New Orleans: `Boy, 6, Shot by his Brother.' `Boy Accidentally Shot by Cousin.' `17-month-old Shot Accidentally by Boy.' `9-year-old Oasis Boy Accidentally Shot.' That is in California. `Boy Paralyzed in a Gun Accident.' 
There is something I want to point out. When we look at the statistics, we don't show the wounded, we show only the fatalities. For every death, up to eight victims are wounded and often live their lives nursing chronic injuries. So what we do here just doesn't deal with preventing deaths, but also with preventing debilitating injuries. 
I think I have stated the case as best as I can. I don't know if my colleague from New Hampshire is going to take to the floor, but I do know that Senator Biden will be here at 4 o'clock, I say to the chairman. He would like to have an opportunity to speak. If Chairman Gregg would like to enter into unanimous consent that we can set this aside until Senator Biden comes, I am happy to do that. That would be, I think, a good way.

It is my intention to yield most of my time to my colleague from Illinois. When I first heard about the Craig amendment and looked it over, without getting into the details, I thought this looked like something I could support. Now I am having doubts about it due to the enforcement provisions. 
I am going to turn it over to my friend and colleague from Illinois.

Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, it is very hard for me to vote for something that has so many loopholes in it. Maybe during the time in the well the Senator from Idaho can convince me of this, but basically you can't use evidence as evidence. That is what the words say. Here it is: 
Notwithstanding any other provision of law, evidence regarding compliance or noncompliance with the amendments made by this section shall not be admissible as evidence. 
So you can't use evidence as evidence. I don't know--this is confusing. 
I just say to my friends and colleagues, there is only one reason we have taken so much time on this. I was wondering what was going on here, because I came to the floor very early this morning and said let's vote up or down to require that child safety locks be put on handguns, because 5,000 kids are dying in America in a year and no kids are dying in Japan of gunshots. As you look at this chart, you can see that. 
This is a figleaf, a cover. I don't think it does anything. People can vote the way they want. The next vote is the key vote.

Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I introduced the Prostate Testing Full Information Act in June of 1997 following a series of town hall meetings in my State of California. At these meetings, we brought together the top prostate cancer experts in the State, the head of the urology branch at the National Cancer Institute, and prostate cancer survivors. Participants at these meetings reached consensus that Congress needs to do much more to fight prostate cancer. I introduced my bill to mobilize Congress on this issue and to increase resources to help the thousands of men who suffer from prostate cancer. 
Last month, President Clinton announced the release of $60 million for prostate cancer research grants in a promising new Department of Defense program. This DoD research complements research at the National Institutes of Health. It is an essential component of the national effort to find effective treatment for prostate cancer. 
To institute this program at the $60 million level, the DoD had to combine two years of appropriations. Even then, the program was only able to fund 25 percent of the worthwhile research projects presented. Every meritorious grant that goes unfunded is a missed opportunity to find a cure. 
To ensure the strength of the DoD program, Congress should appropriate $80 million for fiscal year 1999. This would include $60 million to continue funding peer-reviewed research projects, and $20 million to maintain other elements of the DoD prostate cancer program, such as the prostate cancer imaging project at Walter Reed Medical Center and research initiatives to target minority populations. To appropriate anything less than $80 million would send a devastating message to the men living and dying from this disease, to their families, and to the scientific community that is working to find a cure. 
The Senate Appropriations Committee has proposed, at a minimum, funding prostate cancer research at the same level as last year. That proposal is not good enough. We need to do more on prostate cancer--not the same as we have done in the past. The Senate proposal does not provide sufficient funds to expand prostate cancer research. We need to appropriate at least $80 million for prostate cancer research at the DoD if we are to reach our goal of funding a cure for this disease. 
41,800 American men will die from prostate cancer this year. It is the most commonly diagnosed non-skin cancer among all Americans. More than 15 percent of all new cases of cancer this year in America will be prostate cancer, but less than 4 percent of total federal cancer research funds go to prostate cancer research. In the United States, prostate cancer kills about the same number of men each year as breast cancer kills women, yet prostate cancer receives only one-sixth of the research funding for breast cancer. This does not mean we should cut breast cancer research. Rather, we need to significantly increase our commitment to prostate and other cancer research. 
Yesterday, 575 men were diagnosed with prostate cancer; another 575 men will be diagnosed today. 114 men died yesterday of prostate cancer and that same number will die today. We cannot make a difference for yesterday or today. But we can and must make a difference for tomorrow. I urge my colleagues to support this increase in funding for prostate cancer research at the Department of Defense so we can make true progress in the fight against devastating disease.

Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I voted for the Grassley sense of the Senate amendment to the Agriculture Appropriations bill because I support nine of its ten provisions. 
I do not support the provision stating that we should enact the bill S. 1269, which reauthorizes fast-track trading authority for the President. 
It is premature and disruptive to endorse fast-track legislation now, before resolving questions about its effect on jobs and the environment. These are very controversial and complicated problems, and so far we have not figured out how to deal with them. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

I hope the Senate will vote to table the Bryan amendment for four reasons: One, we reformed the program and the proceeds do not any longer go to big business; they go to small businesses and cooperatives; two, we have cut this program down from a high of $300 million to about $90 million; three, other countries spend billions of dollars promoting their exports; this is the least we can do; and, four, for every $1 that we put into this Market Access Program, we get back $12 in increased exports. So I hope you will join me in voting to table the Bryan amendment.

 Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I would like to express my serious concern about Iran's continuing efforts to obtain missile technology. 
It has been widely reported that Iran has produced chemical weapons and is actively pursuing the development of biological and nuclear weapons. When these deadly technologies are coupled with advanced ballistic missiles, they become true weapons of mass destruction, posing a grave and direct threat to U.S. troops stationed in the Persian Gulf are as well as our key ally in the Middle East, the State of Israel. 
Iran's quest to develop ballistic missiles has been aided by several Russian corporations, who have sold Iran key technology and provided important technical support. Public reports indicate that Iran is extremely close to deploying advanced ballistic missiles. If we fail to take meaningful action quickly, Iran could deploy chemical-tipped ballistic missiles within one year. 
Congress reacted appropriately to this threat by passing the Iran Missile Proliferation Sanctions Act in May by a vote of 90-4. The bill would impose sanctions on individual companies--not governments--that assist Iran in developing ballistic missile technology. 
To its credit, the government of Russia, after considerable prodding from the U.S. State Department, has taken meaningful steps toward halting the export of sensitive technology. Unfortunately, these measures alone are not sufficient to freeze the Iranian missile program. The Iran Missile Proliferation Sanctions Act is needed. 
I regret the Administration's decision to veto this important bill. I understand its view that the Executive Branch alone should attempt to resolve this issue. However, I believe the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction is an issue of such tremendous importance that legislation is warranted. 
I hope the Majority Leader will schedule a vote on the veto message soon, and I hope my colleagues will continue to show strong support for the Iran Missile Proliferation Sanctions Act.

Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am very pleased that the Senate is considering today the nomination of A. Howard Matz to be U.S. District Judge for the Central District of California. 
With all the support Mr. Matz has from both Democrats and Republicans, I know the Senate will agree he is eminently qualified to sit on the U.S. District Court for the Central District in California. 
I first recommended Mr. Matz for this seat on the federal bench on July 23, 1997, and said then that Howard Matz is an exceptional attorney and person. His experience, intelligence, and integrity make him extremely well-qualified for the Federal bench. 
Howard Matz is currently a partner in private practice. He represents largely business clients in civil and white-collar crime matters. His clients have included IBM, Walt Disney Co., the cities of Anaheim and Riverside, Yale University and numerous individuals, partnerships, lawyers, and law firms. I would like to note here that I am not related to Joel Boxer, a partner in Howard's firm. 
Mr. Matz received his undergraduate degree from Columbia University and his law degree from Harvard University. In addition to working in various law firms, early in his career he clerked for U.S. District Court Judge Morris Lasker. As an Assistant U.S. Attorney in the Criminal Division, in charge of the Los Angeles Fraud and Special Prosecutions team, he has always believed the punishment should fit the crime. Mr. Matz is highly regarded in the legal community, having written many articles on legal topics and having served as a speaker and panelist on legal matters numerous times. He has received many awards and other distinctions from representatives of the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Department of Health and Human Services, and the Internal Revenue Service for cases he handled as a prosecutor. 
Complementing his exceptional legal career, Matz also engages regularly in pro bono work and is very active in his community. He is on the board of directors of Bet Tzedek, having once served as the President of this highly respected provider of legal services for the poor. He has also served on the board of the Los Angeles Legal Aid Society. He is a member of the Board of Overseers for the Los Angeles campus of the Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion and is one of the founding sponsors of the Skirball Cultural Center and Museum. 
Howard Matz has received numerous letters in support of his nomination. 
Judge Lourdes G. Baird, was appointed to the U.S. District Court in the Central District of California by President Bush. Howard Matz was Judge Baird's mentor at the United States Attorney's office when the served as Assistant U.S. Attorney together. Judge Baird wrote `For over 20 years I have known Howard Matz well, both professionally and socially, and strongly believe that he would be an outstanding federal judge if given the opportunity.. . . I am certain that one could find very few candidates who could fulfill the demands of this position as well as Howard.' 
Sheriff Sherman Block of the County of Los Angeles wrote in a letter to Chairman Hatch `Matz is an extremely hard working individual of impeccable character and integrity. His list of credits, both professionally and within the community, is extensive. I would like to recommend that you favorably consider this appointment. I have no doubt that he would be a distinguished addition to the United States District Court.' 
Gil Garcetti, the Los Angeles County District Attorney, has known Howard Matz for almost 15 years. Gil Garcetti turns down most requests of support from those seeking appointments, but for Mr. Matz, he felt the need to express his strong support. Garcetti wrote to Chairman Hatch `His unusually diverse background--representing clients in civil and criminal litigation, in state court and federal court, as plaintiffs and defendants--has given him a view of the judicial process which would compel him to exercise his responsibilities as a federal judge with restraint.. . . I am confident Howard possesses no other agenda than to preside fairly and to rule with due regard for the importance of precedent.' 
George O'Connell, former U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of California under President Bush, and former Assistant U.S. Attorney in both Los Angeles and Sacramento, wrote `I can only underscore the I think Mr. Matz would make a superb United States District Judge.. . . I do not think that he would engage in inappropriate judicial activism. Rather, I believe he would make the most sincere efforts to achieve justice within the existing framework of the law.' 
Robert Bonner, former U.S. Attorney (Appointed by President Reagan), former U.S. District Court Judge in the Central District of California, former head of the Drug Enforcement Administration (Appointed by President Bush), has known Matz for nearly 25 years, and served side-by-side as Assistant U.S. Attorney in the Criminal Division of the U.S. 
Attorney's office in the Central District of California. Bonner wrote in a letter to Chairman Hatch that he believes `Howard Matz possesses those attributes of character, knowledge and intellect that convince me that he will be an outstanding federal district judge. On a personal note, and on an issue of concern to both of us, not only do I know Howard well, but I believe that, if appointed, he will not be an activist jurist.' 
Harold Blatt, the head of Bryan Cave LLP, sent Senator Ashcroft two detailed support letters from California partners of his distinguished firm, who know Mr. Matz very well. 
Ronald Olson, a former Iowan and former chair of the American Bar Association Federal Judiciary Committee, writes to Senator Grassley that he has known Howard for most of his professional life. Olson wrote `Howard is a lawyer who understands the limitations of the law as well as its possibilities, and I can assure you that he will serve as a judicial officer in a way that respects the limited powers of the Court and the fundamental roles of the legislative and executive branches.' 
John Fishel, Executive Vice President of the Jewish Federation, wrote `Mr. Matz would make an outstanding federal judge and hope that his nomination will receive serious consideration.'

Mrs. BOXER. Thank you very much. 
Mr. President, we had such a golden moment in history here in the Senate to do something for our children. Finally, after both parties talked about how much we care about our kids, we had a chance to pass a bill that did something to help them. We had the opportunity to pass an education bill that addressed the real issues that face parents and children every single day. We know what those are. 
Kids have nothing to do after school. They sometimes go home to an empty home. We know afterschool programs are critical for these children. We know they lift up those children. We know it improves their scores when they have afterschool programs. The police tell us it keeps them out of trouble at a time when the juvenile crime rate soars. So we did nothing about that. I offered an afterschool amendment on that on the Coverdell bill. We lost by two votes. The people on the other side who today say they are doing so much for education couldn't support afterschool for our kids. 
We also know class sizes are too large. We could lower those class sizes. We had such an amendment to the Coverdell bill; down it went. And the amendments that did pass on school construction and dropout prevention, which were offered by people on our side of the aisle, were dropped in conference like a hot potato. 
So what comes back to us today? A $7-a-year tax cut for people who send their kids to public school, a $37 tax cut for people who send their kids to private school. This leaves unaddressed issues that face parents and children. 
I didn't come to the Senate to be able to go home and say I voted for an education bill just for the sake of saying I voted for an education bill. There is not anything to this bill. `There is no `there, there,' as someone once said. We can go home and claim we did something, but I wouldn't do that. I don't want to squander money on things that don't really make a difference in the lives of the people who I represent. 
We need to fix up our schools. To hear my superintendent of public instruction back home talk about it, these kids are learning about gravity because the ceiling is falling down on their desk. They are not learning about it from a textbook. 
But we do nothing. We walk away. 
I heard my friend from New Jersey, who is supporting this bill, talk about these issues. He made the best speech I ever heard on education, except nothing that he said is in this bill. What is the point in voting for a bill that takes over $1 billion away from funds we could use for education and gives so little benefit? It really seems to me it is a poor excuse for an education policy. 
I am not going to vote for this bill today just to say I voted for something. Education is the No. 1 issue in my State. I came here to make a difference in the lives of the people of my State. If we are going to spend $1.6 billion; it better be on something that helps those children. 
In the end I think the President is not going to support this bill. The President has been a very strong leader for really doing something for our children. He calls for tough national standards. That is not in this bill. He calls for afterschool programs. They are not in this bill. He calls for school construction. That is not in this bill. He calls for putting 100,000 new teachers in the classrooms. That is not in this bill. 
Some say this is bipartisan. To some narrow extent, it may be but those supporting this bill did not really reach out and sit down with our President. When he was Governor, education was his No. 1 issue, and he tried some good things. We could have had a bill before us that he supported, that we supported, that could have become a good law. We could have had a bill where I could go home and look at kids' eyes in my State and say, `I just did something to make your life better, to give you a good quality education.' I cannot do that today. I am extremely disappointed, extremely disappointed. 
I hope I live to see the day that we have an action plan for our schools, an action plan for our families, an action plan for our children so I can go home and be proud that I really did something about education.

Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, when I was a little girl, my mother used to tell me about my grandfather, who I never met, because he died very young from a smoking-related illness. I heard about how wonderful he was. And my mother, I remember her saying almost every day of my life, `Don't smoke. Don't smoke.' Little did I know then that I would have a chance to do something to turn this epidemic around. And what happens tonight? We are sitting here and are going to see those on the other side kill a chance to make a difference by killing a bill that people are going to continue to die from. It is as simple as that. 
I just want to say I watched those amendments that were loaded on. Those were amendments from the other side of the aisle, which they said they had to have to vote for a bill. Now they don't even vote for a bill. That shows you the power of the tobacco companies.

 Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today, I would like to call to the attention of the Senate and the nation the exceptional work of Mr. Harrison Lim, founder and executive director of Charity Cultural Services Center in the San Francisco Bay Area. 
Harrison Lim immigrated to the United States in 1970. He established the original Charity Cultural Services Center (CCSC) in San Francisco in 1983 and opened a second, San Jose based CCSC in 1991. Drawing from his own experiences and challenges as a newly arrived immigrant, Mr. Lim created CCSC to help speed and ease the transition of newcomers to life in America. 
CCSC is the embodiment of Harrison Lim's belief in the importance of community and self-sufficiency. Among the many services CCSC provides are English language instruction, job skills training, counseling and placement, and juvenile outreach. These programs are working. The Center's Employment Training and Placement Program, which trains chefs, bartenders and waiters, boasts a placement rate of over 90 percent. The Center's Families in Transition Program is out in the community every day addressing the needs of at-risk young people through such things as academic tutoring, counseling, volunteer opportunities, self esteem and confidence building, recreational activities and parental involvement. 
Mr. Lim's personal story is one of determination, dedication and triumph. He and his wife and three children left Hong Kong to care for Harrison's ailing mother and begin a new life in California. Although he was a respected teacher and journalist in his native land, he ran into many obstacles upon his arrival to America. He had difficulty with the language and was forced to accept jobs well below his skill and education levels. Tragically, he also encountered people and businesses unwilling to give him a chance to succeed simply because he was new to this country. 
But Harrison Lim persevered and has not only succeeded, he has prospered. Appropriately, this prosperity cannot be measured in dollars and cents. To be truly understood, it must be seen in the light of the many thousands of lives he and his Charity Cultural Services Center have made richer over the years. 
Twenty-eight years ago Harrison Lim travelled to a country renowned for freedom and opportunity. By pursuing a life and career true to his own values and those of his adopted country, Harrison Lim has made the American Dream a reality for his family and for countless others. He has my utmost respect and admiration.

 Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today I am introducing a bill that will make a significant difference in the lives of millions of American women--the Silicone Breast Implant Research and Information Act. There is one basic reason for this bill: to make sure women have accurate and complete information so they can make informed decisions about their health. 
Each year, nearly 180,000 women are diagnosed with breast cancer in the United States. In total, approximately 2.6 million Americans live with breast cancer. When a women undergoes a mastectomy, she faces the decision of whether to have reconstructive surgery, and one important option she has is to have a silicone breast implant. 
Between 1 and 2 million women in the United States have received silicone breast implants over the last 35 years, as part of reconstructive surgery after mastectomy, or for cosmetic purposes. 
Many women with silicone implants have come forward with a variety of symptoms and atypical illnesses. Although research over the years has attempted to get to the bottom of this, we still don't have the answers women need and deserve. 
In 1992, the Food and Drug Administration restricted the availability of silicone breast implants because it had not received enough evidence to prove that these implants are safe. Currently, silicone breast implants are only available to women who have had breast cancer surgery or who have other special medical needs, such as a severe injury or birth defect. Women who need to have an implant replaced for medical reasons, such as rupture of the implant, are also eligible. 
These women should have access to the broadest possible treatment options--including breast implants. But it is just as essential that women can count on sound scientific research regarding the safety of implants. It is essential that the Federal Government coordinate its efforts on this issue to maximize the use of limited resources. 
This bill contains three components women need to make informed decisions about silicone breast implants--research, information, and coordination. It gives women not only options, but information and peace of mind.

Mrs. BOXER. I thank the Senator. This conference report has provided important funding to preserve a bridge in California. This bridge is not just any bridge. It is the bridge that is a symbol for my state and it is a national treasure. The Golden Gate Bridge is truly a jewel in California. It frames California as our Pacific Gateway. I believe many Americans would agree it is one of our nation's most magnificent architectural treasures. 
But, Mr. President, it is also highly vulnerable to earthquakes. We need to protect it. We have a 1.2 billion program in the Bay Area to protect our bridges from earthquakes. This seismic retrofit and new construction is being paid for entirely by state revenues and by tolls paid by our motorists. The Golden Gate, however, is not a state bridge. It is not a Federal bridge. It is owned by the Golden Gate Bridge and Highway Transportation District which collects the tolls and operates a local mass transit service. Consequently, the bridge, this treasure, needs additional funds in order to pay for a $217 million program to protect the bridge from earthquakes. 
I am so pleased that Senator Chafee and my colleagues on the conference committee heeded our pleas for help on this project and provided $51.75 million for the retrofit program. That amount includes $25 million from the Bridge Discretionary program. 
I ask the chairman if it is his understanding that the Golden Gate Bridge is eligible for additional funding from the discretionary bridge program.

Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, as an original cosponsor of the Iran Missile Proliferation Sanctions Act, I cannot stress enough the importance of this legislation and I am grateful that it is now being considered before the full Senate. 
Iran's desire to obtain ballistic missiles is a direct threat to peace and security in the Middle East, and therefore, a clear threat to U.S. national security. Limiting the spread of weapons of mass destruction and ensuring stability in this strategic region must remain among the highest priorities for the U.S. and our allies. 
Iran is a leading sponsor of international terrorism and has been linked to numerous bombings, hijackings, and assassinations. This rogue nation provides financial support and political training for terrorist groups such as the Islamic Jihad, Hamas, and Hezbollah. Just this week, the Argentine government announced they have proof that Iran was behind the 1992 bombing of the Israeli Embassy and the 1994 bombing of the Jewish Community Center in Buenos Aires. 
According to news reports, Iran is months away from developing missiles that can reach Israel, Saudi Arabia, or the frontiers of the NATO alliance. Considering that Iran is already suspected of possessing chemical and biological weapons and is trying to acquire nuclear weapons capability, the threat of Iran possessing missiles capable of reaching U.S. forces in the Middle East is truly frightening. 
This legislation would require the President to report periodically on individuals, companies, and research facilities who have provided material, technology, or technical assistance that could help Iran develop ballistic missiles. Once these suppliers have been identified, they would be subject to sanctions making them ineligible for export licenses and U.S. aid. 
I believe this legislation will be a valuable tool in slowing Iran's program to develop ballistic missiles. I hope that the Senate overwhelmingly passes this legislation, and I want to thank the Majority Leader, Senator Lott, for all his hard work on this important issue.

Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I thank Senator Kerry very much for his leadership on this issue. Senator Kerry, Senator McCain and many other colleagues, including Senator Conrad and Senator Daschle, our Democratic leader, have put in so much time and effort on this important issue. I extend my thanks to them. 
Mr. President, I have not spoken yet on the floor on the subject of tobacco legislation. I am going to be concise. Let me tell you why. I am going to be concise because this not is a difficult call for me. I am going to support the strongest possible tobacco legislation we can put together. I am going to support not the weakest, but the strongest tobacco legislation we can put together. There are two reasons for this. First, Smoking kills our people. Second, kids are the targets of the tobacco companies, which is a crime against them and against all of us. For these two critical reasons we must act now to pass the strongest tobacco legislation possible. 
I have a couple of charts that I am going to share which I think tell the story. This one says, `Tobacco Kills and Smokers Get Hooked as Teenagers.' Approximately 90 percent of adult smokers started smoking at or before the age of 18. When they are older, 66 percent of them say, `Oh, my God, I wish I could quit.' We need to do something to help young people so that they are not faced with this painful, horrible addiction later in life. 
How do you do that? You don't do that by siding with the tobacco companies. You do that by siding with the public health experts in this country. 
This chart very clearly shows how people die from tobacco. We will start off with stroke deaths, 23,281. I am not going to round off these figures, because each one represents a real person, your father, your mother, my grandmother, my grandfather, et cetera. It is all of us represented in these numbers. 
Lung cancer, 116,920 deaths from lung cancer. 134,253 deaths from heart disease. Bronchitis/emphysema deaths, 14,865. 
This many deaths occur every single year. Every single year Americans have these painful, awful deaths. 
Pneumonia, 19,173 deaths. Hypertension, 5,450 deaths. All of these deaths are related to smoking. Secondhand smoke cancer deaths--how is this one? These individuals don't even smoke, but they breathe it because someone they work or live with smokes and 3,000 people die every year. Absolutely proven fact, secondhand smoke kills 3,000 innocent people every year. 
Other cancer deaths related, 31,402. Other cardiovascular diseases, 16,854. Other respiratory diseases, 1,455. And how about infant diseases; 1,711 infants are dying. Burn deaths, 1,362. Chronic airway obstructions, 48,982. 
It adds up to 400,000 dead Americans every single year. In spite of this terrible fact, some of my colleagues are standing with the tobacco companies. I am sorry--count me out of that crowd. 
Who am I going to stand with? RJR Tobacco? Philip Morris? No. I am going to stand with Dr. Everett Koop. I am going to stand with Dr. David Kessler. I am going to stand with the medical community. I am not going to stand with the tobacco companies. I am going to stand with the American Association of Public Health Physicians, the American Lung Association, the American Medical Student Association, the American Medical Women's Association, the American Patient Association, the Americans For Nonsmokers' Rights, the Association of Military Surgeons of the United States, 
the Association of Black Cardiologists, the Center for Women Policy Studies, the Child Welfare League of America, Chinese American Antismoking Alliance, Citizens for a Tobacco-Free Society, Interreligious Coalition on Smoking and Health, National Asian Women's Coalition--the list goes on and on and on. 
I am going to stand with the public health community. If my colleagues want to stand with the tobacco companies, that is their free choice; they are free to do it, and they are also free to explain it to their constituents. 
One of the things I heard yesterday from one of our colleagues, Senator Ashcroft, is how horrible it is to increase the cost of a pack of cigarettes; isn't that terrible for poor people. The very people on this floor who are complaining that we are hurting poor people were never there when we passed the earned income tax credit that helped lift Americans out of poverty. They were never there when we raised the minimum wage. Now, suddenly, they are concerned. It is my opinion what they are really concerned about is the tobacco companies. 
I don't hear these same people saying, `Well, America, if you really want to put money in your pocket, you can give up smoking and pocket the money from the two packs or three packs you smoke a day.' That is what they could be saying. When they talk about the tax on cigarettes, I don't think they are really concerned about poor people. I think they are concerned about the tobacco industry. 
What I am concerned about is not just the cost of cigarettes, not only in dollars but in lives. 400,000 lives every year and 80 percent of them are hooked as teenagers. I am going to show you another chart. 
This chart must look very dizzying on TV. Let me tell you what it is. It is 3,000 stick figures of children. That is how many kids become new smokers every single day. 
Today, 3,000 children will start to smoke. Every third one will die from a smoking-related illness. These children are shown in the darker shade. Every third one will die. 
I have seen colleagues come to the floor with charts about how with tobacco legislation there is going to be bureaucracy, and it is going to be terrible. You want to take a look at this --3,000 teenagers starting to smoke every day and every third one of them will die. That is what is truly terrible. What is terrible is that children are smoking and these children will die. 
That is why I am standing here today. I urge my colleagues to listen to the arguments on the floor and remember that it all comes back to two issues: One is that every day 1,000 kids put themselves at certainty of death from smoking, and in every year, 400,000 Americans die and almost 90 percent of them started just like this when they were kids. 
I have to tell you, passing strong tobacco legislation isn't even a close call for me. 
Under oath the tobacco companies said, `We do not market to children.' They said, `Our advertising is not designed to attract young smokers.' 
But when the lawsuits were filed against the tobacco industry, they came up with all these smoking guns, if you will. 
We have to compliment the efforts of dedicated government attorneys who worked on this. I would like to extend a special thanks to Louise Renne, the City Attorney for the City and County of San Francisco. It was due to her tireless efforts of that we have many of the documents that show how the tobacco industry targeted our children. 
From a Philip Morris memo in 1981:  
It is important to know as much as possible about teenage smoking patterns and attitudes. Today's teenager is tomorrow's potential regular customer, and the overwhelming majority of smokers first begin to smoke while still in their teens . . . it is during the teenage years that initial brand choice is made. 
This is from a private, internal memo. And how about this: 
. . . Because of our high share of market among the youngest smokers, Philip Morris will suffer more than the other companies from the decline in the number of teenage smokers. 
Philip Morris is going to suffer? Philip Morris is going to suffer if kids stop smoking? It is in black and white. I ask them about the suffering of people who die from these diseases. Have you ever seen someone die of lung cancer? Have you ever seen someone sit near you on a plane with oxygen going up their nose because they can't breathe? Philip Morris is going to suffer? Smoking is what causes real suffering. 
I am going to stand with the public health officials. I am going to stand with them, and I am going to stand with them proudly. People can come on this floor, and I welcome their debate, but when you cut to the chase, the arguments against strong tobacco legislation are same arguments Philip Morris is making, they are the same arguments RJR is making, they are the same arguments that tobacco companies and their sophisticated lawyers are making. Their arguments have nothing to do with the hard, cold facts that they are trying to hook our kids. 
As Senator McCain said today, we know, we can do something about it and at least we know we cannot tolerate the status quo. That is what this tobacco legislation is all about. 
A draft report from RJR said: 
. . . The brands which these beginning smokers accept and use will become the dominant brands in [the] future. Evidence is now available to indicate that the 14- to 18-year-old group is an increasing segment of the smoking population. RJR [tobacco] must soon establish a successful new brand in this market if our position in the industry is to be maintained over the long term. 
It is time that we expose this danger these companies pose to our children. It is time to end the horrific costs to our society of losing a wife, a mother, a grandma too soon because when they were young, they got hooked on tobacco; they got hooked by companies who swore to God in front of this Congress that they never went after kids. 
Why should we stand with the tobacco companies? Why should we? We shouldn't. We should stand with C. Everett Koop. We should stand with the American Lung Association. We should stand with the people who care about our children. 
Brown and Williamson in 1973, another tobacco company said: 
Kool has shown little or no growth in share of users in the 26 [plus] age group. Growth is from 16 to 25-year-olds . . . at the present rate, a smoker in the 16 to 25-year-old age group will soon be three times as important to Kool as a prospect in any other broad age category. 
There it is. For anyone to think that we should stand with those companies who went after our children--for anyone who thinks that is the right thing to do--I guess I just don't understand their position. 
It comes down to two things: Smoking kills and they grab our kids, and they grab 3,000 kids every single day, and every third one will die of smoking-related illness. 
These cigarette companies even discussed adding honey to cigarettes so they could grab the youngsters. Here is that quote. A 1972 Brown and Williamson document states: 
It's a well-known fact that teenagers like sweet products. Honey might be considered. 
We have to do something. We should pass the strongest possible tobacco bill. 
One successful way to reach the children is through education, and one proven success is to make sure that in after-school programs, our kids are taught about the dangers of drugs, alcohol and smoking. It works. 
I am working on an amendment to make sure that when we support tobacco cessation programs, we do not disqualify after school programs. I am excited to say that it looks like that amendment will be accepted. 
Mr. President, I see that my colleague is ready to attack on his point of view, and I am going to yield. If I might have 20 seconds?

Mrs. BOXER. Thank you very much. I will not be using that much time, I say to my friend. So I urge him to just stay on the floor. 
I do not have complicated reasons for supporting the strongest possible legislation. It is simply about life and death. And it is very obvious to me that by passing comprehensive, tough legislation, we have a chance to stop kids from smoking and to stop the deaths and turn these awful statistics around. We have what may be a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to do it. I hope we are going to do it. 
Not every amendment that I vote for is going to be in the final package. I understand that. But I am going to support the toughest bill possible. I am going to offer an amendment to make sure that we support after school programs to educate our children against the problems of smoking. There are many effective after school programs that teach kids about tobacco in a very straightforward, good way so that they resist the temptation and peer pressure to smoke. 
So I am glad to stand with my friends in the Senate who look at this as an opportunity to stop deaths, to stop the targeting of our children. And I am very hopeful, Mr. President, that we will, in fact, end up with a strong piece of anti-tobacco legislation. 
Thank you very much, I say to my colleague from Texas, for his generous spirit. I yield the floor.

Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I wish to inform the Senate of the reason I voted `present' on the Gregg amendment related to liability limits for tobacco companies. 
I abstained on this vote because my husband's law firm is co-counsel in several lawsuits against tobacco companies filed in California state court by health and welfare trust funds. 
The Ethics Committee has advised me that voting on an amendment such as this `would not pose an actual conflict of interest' under the Senate Code of Conduct. 
However, I decided that this vote could create the appearance of a conflict of interest and therefore I abstained by voting `present.'

 Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today I call upon my colleagues to support the Violence Against Women Act of 1998 which we introduce today. 
Domestic violence is the number one cause of injury to women in the United States. Every 9 seconds, a woman is physically abused by her husband or boyfriend. 42 percent of all murdered women are killed by current or ex-partners. Approximately 95 percent of the victims of domestic violence are women. More than 3 million children witness acts of domestic violence every year. 
In 1994, Congress passed the bipartisan Violence Against Women Act (VAWA). Under VAWA, the Department of Justice awarded over $483 million under to the states for domestic violence programs. The largest portion of the money goes toward `STOP' grants, which bring together police, prosecutors, counselors, shelter providers and other organizations to develop coordinated services for women dealing with domestic violence. 
These funds make a difference in women's lives. My home State of California has received more than $46 million under VAWA, plus an additional $19 million for battered women's shelters and services. 
With VAWA funds, Los Angeles County increased the number of shelters from 18 in 1994 to 25 shelters today, adding 200 additional shelter beds for women and children. One organization, the 1736 Family Crisis center, opened a new shelter in large part due to VAWA funds. The Valley Oasis shelter in the high dessert expanded its number of beds significantly, again due in large part to VAWA. Throughout California, VAWA helped fund more than 77 domestic violence shelters. 
In California, in fiscal year 1998 alone, VAWA provided: $875,000 to fund domestic violence and children's services such as counseling, shelters, and safety planning; $1.8 million for specialized domestic violence units in local law enforcement agencies; $2.7 million to fund prosecution units that specifically handle domestic violence cases; and $1.2 million for its multi-disciplinary sexual assault response team victim advocate project, which brings together police officers, doctors, nurses, advocates, and counselors to respond to victim's needs within hours of a sexual assault. 
VAWA funds sheriffs in San Diego, San Francisco and Los Angeles to conduct domestic violence training for thousands of law enforcement officers and for individuals involved in community-oriented policing (the COPS program) throughout the State. This legislation will help continue and expand these and other programs across the country.

 Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I wish today to acknowledge the life and passing of a special man. Nat Bingham was many things: a fisherman, a conservationist, an advocate, an innovator, a husband, a father and a friend to anyone who cares about California's magnificent coastal environment and the lives it supports and sustains. By all accounts he was a person of great decency and conviction. He cared deeply for his profession and all those who heed its honorable call. He will be missed. 
Nat and his wife Kathy made their home in Mendocino County on California's rugged North Coast. Tragically, Kathy died just two weeks before Nat. They are survived by their two children, Jolene and Eli. My heart goes out to them both. 
Nat first became involved with fisheries management issues through his local Salmon Trollers Marketing Association. He served in a number of capacities with the Association before becoming its representative to the Pacific Coast Federation of Fisherman's Associations (PCFFA). On the PCFFA's board, and eventually as its president, he worked tirelessly on issues of habitat and species protection, preservation and restoration. 
After stepping down from the PCFFA's board, Nat eventually sold his boat and went to work full-time on salmon restoration and fish habitat issues. 
It is no exaggeration to say that Nat Bingham was involved with almost every major fisheries issue in California over the last 20 years. Over the course of his career, Nat achieved a near universal reputation for fairness, independence and results. Is he is not a legend already, it is certain he will become one. 
I had great personal respect for Nat Bingham. Just before his death, I offered my strong support for his re-appointment to the federal government's Pacific Fishery Management Council. Nat was ideally suited for this important position. For his sake and the country's sake, I regret very much that he was denied the opportunity to continue his valuable service. 
The people who knew him best describe Nat as a gentle, good and moral man. He was passionate about what he believed in, but regardless of the issues at stake he never failed to treat others with a genuine dignity and respect. In my opinion this is one of the true tests of a leader, and it is one of the principal reasons why he will be so dearly missed. Though his life's work should continue on in the efforts of his fellows, Nat Bingham's spirit and dedication can never be replaced.

Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President I am proud to support the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) of 1998 which I believe is an important step in the evolution of international digital commerce. The DMCA accomplishes two important goals--it implements the World Intellectual Property Organization Copyright Treaty and the World Intellectual Property Organization Performances and Phonograms Treaty. Both treaties include provisions that respond to the challenges of digital technology. 
Although the treaties contain little that is not already covered by U.S. law, the treaties will provide U.S. copyright holders the worldwide protections they need and deserve. In addition, the treaties will go along way towards standardizing international copyright practice. 
Intellectual property, including copyright, is an integral part of the U.S. economy. The core copyright industries accounted for $238.6 billion in value added to the U.S. economy, accounting for approximately 3.74 percent of the Gross Domestic Product. In addition, between 1977 and 1993, employment in the core copyright industries doubled to 3 million workers, about 2.5 percent of total U.S. employment. The copyright industries contribute more to the U.S. economy and employ more workers than any single manufacturing sector including aircraft, textiles and apparels or chemicals. 
Intellectual property is a particularly integral part of the economy of my home state of California. California is the leading producer of movies, computer software, recordings, video games, and other creative works. California's movie and television industries employed approximately 165,000 Californians in 1995 and the combined payroll of those industries was $7.4 billion. Similarly, the California pre-packaged computer software industry employs more than 25,000 Californians. 
Finally Mr. President, I want to note the importance of this bill to Online Service Providers (OSPs) and to Internet Service Providers (ISPs). I believe it is important to update our copyright laws to comport with the digital electronic age in which we now operate. This bill appropriately balances the interests of copyright holders and OSPs/ISPs. It ensures that creative works receive the protection they deserve while also assuring that OSPs/ISPs are not held liable for unknowingly posting infringing material or for merely providing the physical facilities used to upload infringing material. 
I think this is a good bill, a balanced and fair bill, and I am proud to support it.

Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today, I am introducing the Coastal States Protection Act--legislation which I also introduced in the 104th Congress. This act will provide necessary protection for the nation's Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) from the adverse effects of offshore oil and gas development by making management of the federal OCS consistent with state-mandated protection of state waters. I am pleased that Representatives Capps and Miller are introducing the House version of this legislation. 
After many years of hard work to prevent further oil drilling in the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS), I am very pleased to see the broad bi-partisan support that now exists for this issue. I began fighting for ocean protection on the Marin County Board of Supervisors, continued during my 10 years in the House of Representatives, and as a United States Senator representing California. 
Simply put, my bill says that when a state establishes a drilling moratorium on part or all of its coastal water, that protection would be extended to adjacent federal waters. 
It does a state little good to protect its own waters which extend three miles from the coast only to have drilling from four miles to 200 miles in federal waters jeopardizing the entire state's coastline--including the state's protected waters. 
An oil spill in federal waters will rapidly foul state beaches, contaminate the nutrient rich ocean floor upon which local fisheries depend, and endanger habitat on state tidelands. 
My legislation simply directs the Secretary of Interior to cease leasing activities in federal waters where the state has declared a moratorium on such activities thus coordinating federal protection with state protection. 
The bill has a very fundamental philosophy--do no harm to the magnificent coastlines of America and respect state and local laws. 
I also want to express my strong support for the current protection of our precious marine resources. 
The major portions of fragile California coastline is currently protected from the dangers of oil and gas drilling in offshore waters by several provisions of law. The State has a permanent moratorium on oil and gas leasing, which covers state waters up to three miles out. U.S. waters, up to 200 miles out, have been protected by a succession of one-year leasing and drilling moratoria enacted by Congress each year since 1982. 
In addition, in 1990, President George Bush issued a statement directing his Secretary of the Interior to cancel several existing leases and withhold any further leases in California waters for 10 years. With this directive, President Bush showed his commitment to prohibiting offshore drilling in areas where environmental risks outweigh the potential energy benefits to the Nation. 
The strongest protection would be a permanent ban on further offshore oil and gas leases in California waters, and I have asked the President to consider this. 
California, and the rest of the nation, need a clear statement of coastal policy to provide industries, small businesses, homeowners and fishermen more certainty than can be provided by yearly moratoria. Annual battles over the moratoria make long-range business planning difficult, divert resources and attention from the real need for national energy security planning, and send confusing signals to both industry and those concerned about the impacts of offshore development. 
I understand that some feel that we are losing revenue because of these moratoria. I have two things to say about that. First, the public strongly supports the moratorium. And second, if the oil companies paid the royalties that they currently owe the federal government we could make up for the so-called `lost revenue' caused by the moratorium. Oil companies currently owe the federal government millions upon millions of dollars. It does not make sense to give oil companies access to more federal oil when they are already cheating the American taxpayer out of millions of dollars. 
As we celebrate the United Nations Year of the Ocean, we have a prime opportunity to strengthen our commitment to environmental protection by giving Americans a long lasting legacy of coastal protection. 
We must recognize that the resources of the lands offshore California, and the rest of the country, are priceless. We must recognize that renewable uses of the ocean and OCS lands are irreplaceable elements of a healthy, growing economy. These moratoria recognize that the real costs of offshore fossil fuel development far outweigh any benefits that might accrue from those activities. 
I am very pleased that Senators Murray, Sarbanes, Robb, Lautenberg, and Graham are original co-sponsors of this legislation.

Mrs. BOXER. Thank you very much, Mr. President. 
The question before the Senate today is the following: How many securities litigation laws should there be relative to class-action lawsuits involving nationally traded securities? 
I believe the answer is one. And I believed the answer was one when we had this debate in 1995. And even though I advocated for a stronger law at that time, I always thought there ought to be one law. 
We, as policymakers, must establish a regulatory environment in which investors have sufficient rights and remedies while also ensuring that the high-growth industries of our economy, many of which are located in my home State of California, are provided the stability and the certainty they need to expand, grow, and create jobs. 
This bill does just that. It is narrowly crafted to address only the issue of class action lawsuits and nationally traded securities--I think this is very important. It defines and limits class-action lawsuits. It applies only to nationally traded securities. It is a bill which I am proud to support. 
Chairman Levitt, who I respect greatly, Chairman of the SEC, is supportive of this legislation, and I think his words should carry a great deal of weight. We ought to give this law a chance to work in the Federal court and not see this law go to 50 different State courts. This would be very disruptive and it doesn't make sense for nationally traded securities. 
If, after a time, we feel the law isn't good enough, isn't strong enough, isn't working as we had envisioned, we can revisit it and address it as necessary. But I think today we ought to support this bill, as drafted, and assert there ought to be one law when it comes to class action lawsuits involving nationally traded securities. 
So, Mr. President, I am pleased to join the Chairman of the Banking Committee and the ranking member on the Securities Subcommittee, Senator Dodd, in support of this bill. I yield the floor, and I yield the time back to the Senator from New York.

Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, earlier this morning, some of us were on the floor urging the Senate to bring up the Patients' Bill of Rights, a very important bill that would essentially protect patients from decisions made by accountants and bureaucrats in insurance companies and have their health care decisions made by physicians. 
I was talking with the Senator from North Dakota who has been presenting a number of cases that proves our point as to why this legislation is needed, and he shared with me a most extraordinary case coming out of California. I am going to tell the Senate about this case, because we cannot close our eyes to what is happening. 
I share with you the case of Joyce Ching from Agoura, CA. Joyce Ching lived with her husband David and 5-year-old son Justin. In 1992, when David switched jobs, he was offered an array of plans, but Joyce convinced him to join an HMO because she wanted the entire family to go to the same place to get their care. 
In the summer of 1994, Joyce got sick. She began to suffer from severe abdominal pain and from rectal bleeding. The pain was so excruciating that some days she couldn't even get out of bed to be with her son. She visited her HMO doctor and was refused referral to a specialist. 
I am not a physician, but I know enough people who have had problems, and when you have rectal bleeding, that is a sign that something is amiss. Yet, this HMO did not refer her to a specialist. Do you know what her doctor in the HMO told her? That her symptoms would be alleviated by a change in diet. 
She changed her diet, and the symptoms were not alleviated. Fearing that her illness could hamper her chances of having a second child, she continued to complain to the physician that her pain was getting worse, and the doctor said, `Give your diet time,' and still would not refer her to a specialist. 
Finally, after nearly 3 months and countless visits, she was referred to a gastroenterologist, but it was too late. Joyce, 34 years old, was diagnosed in the final stages of colon cancer. 
What is so shocking about this case is that her doctor never really listened to her concerns and never sent her to a specialist. When you find out why, it will send chills up and down your spine. There was a deal in that HMO. They looked at Joyce's profile and they decided: A healthy woman in her thirties, we can't spend more than $28 a month on Joyce. 
I will conclude with this, Mr. President. The HMO's accountants decided that Joyce should cost the HMO $28 a month, and they told the doctor, `If she costs you any more than that, your clinic will have to pay out of its own pocket.' So there was a deal made to give incentives to that clinic not to treat this woman, and she is gone. She is gone forever from the lives of her husband and her beautiful son, and she died at 34. 
I have to say, when we stand up here day after day with these cases, it is not to hear the sound of our own voices, because there are thousands and thousands of stories like this, and people want action. They want decisions made by physicians. They want patients and physicians to be honest with each other. They don't want incentive payments to doctors so that they will not be treated. This is a tragedy that you cannot even measure, Mr. President. I call on the leadership to allow us to bring up the Patients' Bill of Rights. I yield the floor.

Sometimes we set up false fights, and it is a real false fight between those who want to ban drive-through mastectomies, which I would guess is every single Senator in this Chamber, and those who want to go even further and grant patients protections across the board for breast cancer patients, prostate cancer patients, children, the elderly, anyone who gets sick. There is no fight. 
Why are we having a fight? We are having a fight because, as the Senator from Massachusetts has said, we are unable to make this a broader bill. 
I am very proud to be a sponsor of the D'Amato-Feinstein bill, and I am going to be very excited when this bill becomes law, and it will become law. 
We need to do more, and there is no reason why the leadership of the Senate won't give us that opportunity, except that there are many special interests who don't want us to do more, who are pocketing--into deep pockets--profits on a HMO system that shortchanges patients, and that is wrong. 
I was visited by a man named Harry Christie. I have told his story on the Senate floor before. His daughter was diagnosed with a rare tumor in her kidney. She was 9 years old. There were two doctors who had experience operating on that type of tumor. His HMO said, `That's too bad, you have to go with a general surgeon.' 
He said, `This is my only child.' 
And they said, `You're out of luck.' 
Fortunately, Mr. Christie was able to come up with the $50,000 he needed, and he saved his daughter's life. Six years later, she is alive and, yes, the HMO was fined a hefty sum by the State of California. If Mr. Christie had listened to the HMO, he might not have his daughter today. 
All the Senator from Massachusetts and the Democratic leader are saying is we love this mastectomy bill, we want to help you get this bill through, but help us, help us do more. We can stop a woman from having to go through a horrific, outrageous, demeaning, dangerous drive-through mastectomy, and we will with this bill. But what happens when she is out of hope a couple of years later, and she needs to get into a clinical trial where she can have access to certain drugs because nothing else is working? The mastectomy bill is narrow, it doesn't address that. The broader patient rights bill addresses it. 
I want to speak to the issue of the dates when these various bills were put into the hopper, because Senator Feinstein made a good point on that. However, Senator Kennedy had a bill that was offered before the drive-through mastectomy bill. Others had bills that were offered before as well. We don't need to have this argument which pits one against the other. We should be able to pass this bill banning drive-through mastectomies, and allow it to be amended to take up these broader issues, so that if someone has chest pains and goes to the emergency room, they are not going to be told by their HMO that they can't qualify for a payment because, guess what, they didn't actually die and have a heart attack, they actually lived. But it was a prudent person who made that decision to walk into that emergency room. Why should they be penalized? 
I am very hopeful we will pass this drive-through mastectomy bill, but also a broader Patients' Bill of Rights for breast cancer patients, for prostate cancer patients, for Alzheimer's patients, for all the patients, and let's not set up a false argument here. We can do both. Somebody once said you should be able to walk and chew gum at the same time. Well, we should be able to do this very narrow bill and then debate a broader bill and give all of our patients the protection they so richly deserve. 
I yield the remaining time to Senator Kennedy.

Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I support the IRS Restructuring and Reform Act of 1998. This bill, when fully implemented, will achieve 3 important objectives: 
First, it will greatly benefit the American taxpayer who, all too often, has been the victim of overzealous and rogue IRS agents, has been caught, through no fault of his own, in a nearly impenetrable bureaucratic morass, or has received poor and discourteous service from IRS employees. 
Second, the bill will significantly reorganize IRS management and provide the IRS Commissioner with new authority over IRS employees. 
Third, the bill establishes an IRS Oversight Board, comprised of private citizens, the Secretary of the Treasury and a union representative, which will oversee the IRS in administration, management, conduct, and direction. I believe, however, those provisions which most directly benefit the American taxpayer are the real crux of this bill. 
We need effective reforms which restore public confidence in an agency which touches the lives of more people in this country than any other agency. I believe the establishment of a `National Taxpayer Advocate' will provide a significant step toward restoring such confidence. 
The National Taxpayer Advocate, who will have a background in customer service and tax law, as well as have experience representing individual taxpayers, will be one of the most important and critical links between taxpayers and the IRS. Significantly, the National Taxpayer Advocate will not be an IRS employee and cannot have been an IRS employee within two years of his or her appointment. This two year limitation will help ensure the independence that taxpayers who avail themselves of the Advocate's Office expect and deserve. 
As I travel through my home state of California, the most frequent complaints I hear from Californians regarding the IRS are: (1) the difficulty they have receiving assistance resolving problems with the IRS, and (2) the difficulty they have receiving guidance from the IRS relative to their specific tax question or concern. I believe the establishment of a National Taxpayer Advocate, as well as the creation of a system of local taxpayer advocates, will greatly enhance the ability of taxpayers, in my home state and around the country, to receive the assistance and guidance they seek. 
Innocent Spouse relief is another provision of the bill that will directly benefit taxpayers. An `innocent spouse' is one--usually a wife--who signs a joint tax return not knowing that the information contained therein, provided by the other spouse, is erroneous. While relief from liability for tax, interest and penalties is currently available for innocent spouses, that relief is only available in certain limited and narrow circumstances. 
The bill before us, however, would directly impact taxpayers by modifying current law to permit a spouse to elect to limit his or her liability for unpaid taxes on a joint return to the spouse's separate liability amount. I believe this change will greatly enhance the ability of an innocent spouse to establish his or her innocence. 
The final `taxpayer friendly' provision of the bill I will mention is the creation of low-income taxpayer clinics. This provision will ensure that low-income taxpayers, and taxpayers for whom English is a second language, receive tax services at a nominal fee. Such clinics are essential if low-income taxpayers, and taxpayers who have minimal English proficiency are to be represented in controversies with the IRS. 
This provision is particularly important in my home state. According to the 1990 Census, California is home to approximately 2.7 million individuals who speak little or no English. Thus, about 35 percent of all individuals in the U.S. who are non-English speaking reside in California--almost twice the percentage of those non-English speaking persons that reside in Texas and almost three times the number that reside in New York. In addition, California is home to more immigrants--2 million--than any state in the country. It is important, therefore, that we provide these taxpayers with the help they need to be tax compliant. 
Mr. President, taxpayers that come into contact with the IRS, whether they are merely asking questions or whether they are attempting to resolve a disputed claim, should be treated in a fair, respectful and courteous manner. Unfortunately however, we have heard all too often over the past months, of many instances in which IRS employees treated taxpayers rudely, abruptly, and yes, at times so abusively that the offending employee's action could only be called criminal. 
While such actions cannot and should not be imputed to all IRS employees, the overwhelming majority of whom are honest and hardworking, it is important to weed out any employee, even if it is only one, who engages in abusive behavior toward law abiding taxpayers. Taxpayers deserve better. 
In closing, Mr. President, I am very pleased to support this bill today and I hope that it is only the beginning of Congress' commitment to making the IRS more user friendly, improving the management of the IRS and streamlining an overly complex tax code.

Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today Senator Durbin and Senator Bumpers join me in introducing legislation to repeal a special-interest rider attached to the emergency supplemental appropriations bill last week. Representatives Caroyln Maloney and George Miller are introducing companion legislation in the House. 
This rider is a taxpayer rip-off. It blocks the Interior Department from implementing a proposed rule to ensure that oil companies pay a fair royalty for oil drilled on public lands. These royalties are shared between the federal government and the state. 
California law requires that all royalty payments be credited directly to the State Schools Fund. So every penny the oil companies fail to pay is stolen directly form our state's classrooms and our children's education. 
If allowed to stand, this special interest rider will cost American taxpayers an estimated $5.5 million per month, approximately $25 million by the end of this fiscal year. California's share of this lost revenue could be used to hire new teachers, help rebuild crumbling schools, or put dozens of computers in our classrooms. 
When oil companies drill on public lands, they pay a royalty to the federal government, which in turn sends a share of these royalties to the states. The royalty is calculated as a percentage of the value of the oil drilled. 
Here is where the problem lies. The oil companies currently understate the value of the oil drilled, and as a result, they underpay their royalties. Now, and after years of study and Congressional prodding, the Department of the Interior has finally decided to do something about it. 
The Department of the Interior has billed 12 major oil companies over $260 million for back royalty payments. It will have to sue to collect because the current system is so fraught with ambiguity. 
To guarantee taxpayers a fair royalty payment in the future, the Interior Department proposed a simple and common sense solution: pay royalties based on actual market prices, not estimates the oil companies themselves make up. The rule was first proposed 2 1/2 years ago. It has held 14 public workshops and published 5 separate requests for industry comments. And now it has been stopped cold in the dead of night. 
This is one of the clearest examples of a special interest taxpayer rip-off I have ever seen. It saves the wealthiest oil companies in the world millions of dollars while shortchanging taxpayers and California schoolchildren. What does this say about our nation's priorities? This action must not stand, and my colleagues and I will fight it to the end.

 Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, it is my honor today to offer my congratulations to the State of Israel on the 50th anniversary of its independence. I am a great supporter and admirer of our close friend and ally, and I am proud it has survived and prospered to see this momentous day. 
In 1948, the modern State of Israel was created as a symbol of hope for the Jewish people--a people who had suffered through the horror and pain of the Holocaust. We will never forget the terrible evil the Nazis inflicted on the world and we will always remember the dangers of ignoring and appeasing fanatic leaders who climb the ladder by trampling on the innocent. 
What emerged from 3,000 years of persecution and the nightmare of the Holocaust is the greatest tribute to the perseverance of the Jewish people, the State of Israel. Israel has persevered through war, through the murder of its citizens by cowardly terrorists, and through the assassination of its leaders. 
I am proud to say that the United States has helped Israel survive and become the strong nation it is today. The United States has a special relationship with Israel. As two of the world's leading democracies, we share many of the same values: promoting democracy, personal freedom, and human rights throughout the world. We owe the Israeli people our moral support, for weathering as a free state under the most dangerous conditions. As Americans, we must admire their tenacious dedication to the principles of freedom articulated in our own country so long ago. 
Fifty years ago, Israel's first Prime Minister, David Ben-Gurion, broadcast this statement to the Israeli people: 
Something unique occurred yesterday in Israel, and only future generations will be able to evaluate the full historical significance of the event. It is now up to all of us, acting out of a sense of Jewish fraternity, to devote every ounce of our strength to building and defending the State of Israel, which still faces a titanic political and military struggle. 
Now is not the time for boasting. Whatever we have achieved is the result of the efforts of earlier generations no less than our own. It is also the result of unwavering fidelity to our precious heritage, the heritage of a small nation that has suffered much, but at the same time has won for itself a special place in the history of mankind because of its spirit, faith and vision. 
To me, the spirit, faith and vision of the Israeli people is what makes this celebration of Israel so special and remarkable. I congratulate Israel on the 50th anniversary of its founding.

Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I do support the passage of this emergency supplemental, but I want to point out to my colleagues something very important that happened in that committee. There is the presence of a rider in this particular bill. I think you ought to know about it, because you are going to get asked about it. 
It will hurt American taxpayers. It will take literally $5.5 million a month out of their pocket and put it into the pocket of big oil companies. 
Now, what is this about? I will tell you in my remaining time. 
The Mineral Management Services spent 2 1/2 years working on a rule to figure out the best way to collect royalty payments from oil companies. What are royalty payments? They are payments that go to the taxpayers when the companies drill on public lands. 
In this particular emergency supplemental bill is a rider that never was part of the House bill, was never part of the Senate bill. We had 10 minutes to discuss it. And it stops this rule from going into effect. So every month that this new rule is stopped from going into effect, $5.5 million--

Mrs. BOXER. So every month this rule is stopped from going into effect, American taxpayers are shorted $5.5 million. 
Now maybe that doesn't sound like a lot to the folks who put in this rider, but I can tell you the folks in your States are going to wonder why we did this, as it were, in the dead of night, because we really couldn't debate it as much as we should have. 
Although my chairman was very generous and allowed me to make my comments, I still believed that that rider should not have been placed there when it was not part of either the House or Senate bill. 
I yield the remainder to my colleague from Illinois.

Mrs. BOXER. I thank the Senator from Texas. 
Mr. President, I have listened carefully to this debate, and I think what the Hutchison amendment really gets to is what NATO is all about. Perhaps it comes down to how each of us sees NATO. Frankly, I see NATO as a military alliance that has been extremely successful, that has worked very well, and I don't want to see anything happen to NATO that would change the focus of what it really is. 
As I listened to my friend, and I know she in her heart wants to have a mechanism to resolve the disputes that may erupt and are currently erupting, I understand her intention, but as I look at the amendment, I think what will happen is there will be a procedure set up for every group that has a gripe about another ethnic group to come to a forum, to present their case, and perhaps some of them will bring propaganda, that it could turn NATO into a little sideshow, into a world sideshow, a propaganda stage. I am very concerned about that. Again, I think the reason I am concerned is that I support NATO enlargement. I have been waiting to get some time to talk about why. I think this amendment would, in fact, take us off course of what we are trying to do. 
It is important to say that just at the prospect of a country joining NATO there have been 10 major accords that have occurred. In other words, the fact that principles that we have laid down, and some of them are called Perry principles, named after William Perry, we said that if you want to join NATO, you have to have a commitment to democratic reform, you have to have a commitment to a free-market economy, you have to have good, neighborly relations--good, neighborly relations. And because NATO is going to be open to countries that follow these reforms, and others, it seems to me that is one of the best ways we have for resolving problems. 
The agreement has been made between Poland and Lithuania, Poland and the Ukraine, Hungary and Romania, Italy and Slovenia, and Germany and the Czech Republic. So while we come up with charts and ways to show the disputes, we also should celebrate the fact that because we have opened up NATO to countries, assuming they make certain reforms, among them good, neighborly relations, that that has been an incentive. 
Mr. President, everyone approaches this issue from his or her own experiences. I am very strong on this NATO expansion, because I remember well back when I was a teenager watching the television reports of the Hungarian revolution being cut short by Soviet tanks. I think back to those years in 1956 watching freedom crushed and watching people's dreams crushed and thinking to myself, oh, my God, I wish we could do something but we really can't do anything because of the Iron Curtain, because of what was going on in the world. I remember feeling so powerless. 
I feel so proud that all these many years later I can do something positive, to say to that country and to other countries, `You will never have to go through that again.' I feel good about that. 
I don't want to see us get off our course, to change what 
the role of NATO is, to turn it into maybe a mini United Nations, to set up false hopes because, indeed, the Senator herself said it may well be that nothing comes of all of this. If nothing comes of all of this, why do we have to set up a whole new elaborate procedure? I think it is setting up false hopes. I think it is setting up a world stage for propaganda. I think it is setting up a situation where we are getting off what our mission in NATO ought to be about. To me, it is very, very, very serious. 
I believe that expanding the NATO alliance to include Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic, and focusing on that and holding out hope for other nations to join and not changing the focus to these hot spots, if we stick to what NATO is, we are going to see greater peace and security throughout Eastern Europe, the same peace and security that we were able to provide Western Europe for the past 49 years. 
It is important to note that no American soldier has had to fire a shot to defend one NATO ally, nor has a NATO member ever had to wage war to fulfill its security guarantees. This is an incredible record. NATO is a military alliance. It works. If you turn it into something else, you are playing a game with it, and the stakes are far too great, because a peaceful, secure Europe is necessary for a peaceful, secure America. We are inextricably linked. In two World Wars, American troops have fought and died. 
The bottom line is, if we do believe that NATO has worked on the world stage--and the proof is there, never was a shot fired by this alliance--then we should not get off course and adopt amendments that are going to take us away from that goal. 
I know some of my colleagues worry about the situation with Russia, but I do feel we are handling that. We have set up a way to have a dialog with Russia. I really believe whether you listen to our Secretary of State or former majority leader Senator Bob Dole, or Colin Powell, or veterans groups, they are all saying we should stick to our mission in that part of the world, which means a military alliance, not some dispute resolution organization that invites everybody onto a world stage. 
Whether it is Henry Kissinger or Secretary Baker or Madeleine Albright, they all are saying the same things. And the President himself: `A new NATO can extend the blessings of freedom and security in the new century, we can bring Europe together not by the force of arms but by possibilities of peace, that is the promise of the moment and we must seize it.' 
I am worried this amendment, though extremely well intended, will take our eye off what we need to do in Europe, which is, yes, to add countries to the alliance that are willing to undertake free-market economy reforms, that are willing to reach out to their neighbors and solve disputes, that are willing to become truly democratic nations, that are willing to have civilian control over their military. These are the reforms. 
If we turn away from the very simple goals of NATO and expand the mission and change the mission, it looks to me like, again, we are setting up a mini United Nations or something here. 
What is it going to cost? Already there are complaints about the costs. What is it going to cost to do all this, and what are the procedures going to be? If it is a sham, if it is not going to come to anything, if, as the Senator from Texas says, our Ambassador could just call someone up and say, `Forget it, we're not interested'--imagine the news on that, imagine the press conferences held around the world by every ethnic group that says, `The U.S. stopped us from having a dispute resolution.' 
I worry about this amendment because I am such a strong supporter of NATO enlargement, and I want us to keep focused on what we have to do and think we are on the path. And as well intended as it may be, I think this takes us off the path. 
Thank you very much. I thank the Senator from Texas for her generosity in giving me these 10 minutes.

Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, every one of us has memories of historical events that stay with us forever. Those times in history that are so momentous, they strike at our heart and leave a lasting imprint for all our years. 
I think back to the fall of 1956, when the people of Hungary bravely renounced the shackles of tyranny, only to have their dreams of freedom and democracy brutally suppressed. I will never forget sitting around the television with my family, watching the TV footage of this major challenge to Soviet rule be crushed by tanks. Those were dark days for Hungary, as they were for Poland, the Czech Republic, and all nations behind the Iron Curtain. 
The memory of those times makes me appreciate to my core how wonderful it is that the countries of the former Soviet Union are now free and that three of them have the opportunity to join the peaceful community of nations that make up the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. To me, the post-Cold War Era will be truly over when all the nations of Europe--west and east--join in an alliance that will in and of itself indicate a Europe at peace. 
Mr. President, I support NATO expansion, and do so for one primary reason: I truly believe that expanding the NATO alliance to include Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic will lead to greater peace and security throughout Eastern Europe--the same peace and security that American leadership was able to provide Western Europe for the past 49 years. In that time, no American soldier has had to fire a shot to defend a NATO ally, nor has NATO ever had to wage war to fulfill its security guarantees. 
A peaceful, secure Europe is necessary for a peaceful, secure America. We are inextricably linked. In two World Wars, American troops have fought and died as a result of instability in Europe. Through collective defense, an enlarged NATO will help reduce the chance of another major European conflict. 
The formation of NATO in 1949 has enabled Europe to flourish into the prosperous region it is today. I believe history will show that the transformation of a war-ravaged Europe in the first half of the twentieth century to the safe and secure Europe we have seen in the second half of the century is among the most remarkable achievements of our time. I believe NATO can bring that same stability to the former Warsaw Pact nations. 
What is also remarkable are the recent achievements of Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic. These nations have made great strides to reform their economic and political systems to conform with international norms and to provide greater freedom for its citizens. These nations have placed their armed forces under civilian control and have resolved historical disputes that have threatened the region. In all, ten major accords have settled ethnic and border disputes throughout Eastern Europe. These include agreements between Poland and Lithuania, Poland and the Ukraine, Hungary and Romania, Italy and Slovenia, Germany and the Czech Republic. 
During the Senate Foreign Relations Committee's thorough debate on the NATO issue, Colonel Herbert Harman, the National Commander of the Reserve Officers Association, stated that, `over time, the defensive nature of NATO will become clear to all parties, and with it, the realization that NATO threatens no one.' I agree. NATO is strictly a defensive alliance. It does not aim to pose a military threat to Russia or any other nation. I know some of my colleagues do not see it this way, but Russia is making moves toward democracy and those have been recognized by the NATO-Russia Founding Act. The Founding Act, signed in May 1997, created the Permanent Joint Council, a useful forum where NATO and Russia can consult on security issues of mutual interest. This will help facilitate a trusting and constructive relationship between NATO and Russia. Last fall, Ambassador Thomas Pickering put it best when he said, `it is in the security interest of the United States, NATO, and the States of Central Europe to have constructive relations with Moscow, and to integrate a peaceful Russia into the world community.' I would also point out that NATO has an open door policy to other nations wishing to join NATO, including Russia, as long as NATO members determine it would promote European security and the strategic interests of the Alliance. 
Mr. President, there is a long list of high-ranking officials and organizations who support NATO expansion. These include every living former Secretary of State, the former Majority Leader Senator Dole, former National Security Adviser Colin Powell, several veterans groups--including the American Legion--and many, many others. Let us hear the thoughts of some of these distinguished people on NATO expansion. 
Secretary Henry Kissinger says that NATO enlargement `represents above all an overriding American political interest.' Secretary James Baker claims, `The Cold War's legacy of great power confrontation in Europe will be truly ended only when it is replaced by a collaborative structure between former antagonists. The expansion of NATO should be seen in this light.' Our current Secretary of State, Madeleine Albright, states that Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic, `will not just be consumers of security by the United States but producers of a more secure Europe; and also because the United States has interests in Europe, producers of security for the United States.' Senator Dole maintains, `The enlargement of NATO will strengthen security, freedom, and peace in Europe. It will secure the gains of democracy in Central Europe.' 
Once again, I support expanding NATO to include the nations of Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic and want to thank both the Chairman and Ranking Member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee for all their hard work on this historic issue. Let me end with the words of President Clinton, who said, `A new NATO can extend the blessings of freedom and security in a new century . . . we can bring Europe together--not by force of arms, but by possibilities of peace. That is the promise of this moment. And we must seize it.'

Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise today to emphasize the value of our nation's international family planning program. I share the outrage expressed by my colleagues that the United States Congress would even consider the un-democratic and un-American provisions contained in the Foreign Affairs Reform Act. What Congress should really be focusing on as we debate the role of international family planning is the impact of these scarce federal funds on the lives of women and families throughout the world. 
Currently at least one woman dies every minute from causes related to pregnancy and childbirth. In developing countries, maternal mortality is the leading cause of death for women in reproductive age. The World Bank estimates that improved access to family planning would reduce maternal death by 20 percent. In the United States, there are 12 maternal deaths for every 100,000 live births; in parts of Sub-Saharan Africa, this ratio is more than 1,500 maternal deaths for every 100,000 live births. That's over 100 times greater than in the United States. 
By being able to plan their pregnancies, mothers are able to ensure they bear their children at their healthiest times and that pregnancies do not occur too close together. This reduces the risks to the lives of both the mother and her children. Data from developing countries shows that babies born less than 2 years after their next oldest sibling are twice as likely to die in the first year as those born after an interval of at least 2 years. Further analysis suggests that, on average, infant mortality would be reduced by 25 percent if all births were spaced at least 2 years apart. 
Reduced maternal and infant mortality are just two of the benefits of family planning programs. Family planning education also helps prevent the spread of sexually transmitted diseases, including AIDS. Family planning can also reduce the number of abortions. A U.S. study found that for every $1 increase in public funds for family planning, there is a decrease of 1 abortion per 1,000 women. According to the Rockefeller Foundation, in just 1 year, cuts and severe restrictions of federal funding for family planning programs will result in an additional 4 million unplanned pregnancies, and 1.6 million of those pregnancies will end in abortion. These are only conservative estimates. 
U.S. family planning funds are having a profound, positive impact on families throughout the world. Mothers and children are healthier; more women are using contraception; fewer women are having abortions. Let me share just a few examples of the positive role family planning has played in Latin America. In 1960 in Chile, less than 3 percent of married women were practicing family planning, and the abortion rate was 77 abortions per 1,000 married women of reproductive age. By 1990, 56 percent of married women were using family planning, and the abortion rate had dropped to 45 per 1,000. Data from Bogota, Columbia showed that contraceptive use doubled between 1976 and 1990, accompanied by a 40 percent decrease in the abortion rate during the same period. In Mexico City, use of contraception increased by about 24 percent between 1987 and 1992, and the abortion rate fell 39 percent. 
Similar successes can be found in examples from former Soviet Bloc nations. In Almaty, Kazakhstan, the United States population program has provided funding to train doctors and nurses and to increase contraceptive supplies for 28 clinics. Between 1993 and 1994, the number of people receiving contraceptives from the clinics increased by 59 percent, and the number of abortions fell by 41 percent. In Russia, contraceptive use has increased from 19 to 24 percent after an affiliate of the International Planned Parenthood Federation opened in 1991. The abortion rate dropped from 109 per 1,000 pregnancies in 1990 to 76 in 1994. The total number of abortions fell from 3.6 million in 1990 to 2.8 million in 1994. In Hungary, abortion rates dropped dramatically from the late 1960's to the mid-1980's, largely due to the significant increase in contraceptive use. 
The numbers are incredible, but what is truly important and who we can't forget are the women and their families represented in these numbers. One such woman is 30 year old Maria Elena Absalon Ramirez in Mexico. Her husband earns just $80 per month to support Maria and their four children. They cannot afford contraceptives and rely on USAID-funded family planning. These are Maria's words: `What I fear most is becoming pregnant again.' 
I urge my colleagues to recognize the valuable impact of family planning on the lives of millions of families throughout the world, and to oppose restrictions on the use of international family planning funds.

Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask that the Chair inform me when I have used 8 minutes. 
Mr. President, I am very pleased to offer my After School Education and Safety Act as an amendment to the Coverdell bill. I want to mention those who are original sponsors of this legislation. They are: Senators Murray, Bingaman, Johnson, Lieberman, Sarbanes, Kerry from Massachusetts, Dodd, Durbin, Levin, Akaka, Kohl, Wellstone, Bryan, Kennedy, Inouye, Daschle, and Moseley-Braun. I mention them because I am very proud of their support for this very important measure. 
This is not a new issue. I presented this plan to the entire Senate during the budget markup, and I am very pleased to tell you that my amendment was adopted unanimously. I think most Senators understand the fact that after-school programs are very important for two reasons. First of all, our children need the mentoring help, our children need the attention, and our children need the community support after school because it really increases their academic achievement. 
Secondly, the FBI has told us that from the hours of 3 p.m. to 6 p.m., juvenile crime goes way up because our children are joining gangs, and they are getting into trouble after school. We need to do something to keep them busy and to keep them out of trouble. 
That is why I believe I got such unanimous support for this legislation during the budget debate. We have set aside $50 million in the budget for this program. Now we have a chance to authorize it. 
I am very hopeful that my colleagues on both sides of the aisle will now follow though on the commitment they made in the budget resolution. 
Mr. President, in this picture you can see some of the faces of what we are talking about. These are children in a California after-school program in Sacramento. You can see from the looks on their faces how excited they are about the work they are doing after school. 
We have some others pictures to show you. This picture shows some of the valuable mentoring that occurs in this after school program. These children are working in small groups with a teacher or volunteer. These children are learning a tremendous amount. In fact, the academic performance of these students has dramatically increased as a result of the attention that they are getting after school. 
Here are some pictures of the children learning music. There was a new study that just came out yesterday that says that children who engage in musical activities achieve higher levels of academic success. I see that our majority leader is on the floor. He had a group of singing Senators and I think he realizes the value of music. Music promotes camaraderie and bring us together. 
Here we see the children learning how to play the drums in an after-school setting. 
Finally, I have a picture of children working with one of the law enforcement officers who come into these programs. 
Whether it is L.A.'s Best or Sacramento Start, whether it is the Tenderloin Program in San Francisco, or our after school program in Oakland, all of these after school initiatives desperately need some attention from our National Government. There is not one program in the Department of Education that is exclusively for after school, not one. 
Through my amendment we have an opportunity to improve the Coverdell bill, a bill that started off as a very simple bill. Unfortunately, I think that this bill is turning into an anti-education bill. I have to say that with a heavy heart because I really thought that we would have some bipartisanship. 
But what has happened to this bill? I think what we have before us is a bill that has been amended in such a way that it does great damage to our children. Let me explain what I mean. 
We had a number of amendments that were rejected out of hand --amendments to try to rebuild our schools. I understand why Senators who like the underlying bill voted against that, but they have not reached across the aisle to try to come up with any compromise on it at all. 
Our kids are facing schools that are crumbling. We do nothing. We reject it out of hand. We don't work for compromise. We say no. We had an amendment simply expressing support for reducing class sizes that was only debated for 3 minutes. That amendment passed. But then someone changed the vote, and we rejected that. If you ask parents all over this country, they will tell you that they want smaller class sizes. 
So what provisions do we accept? We also voted on an amendment that essentially will prohibit the implementation of a program to test our students so parents will know if their kids are doing well or doing poorly and schools can be held accountable. To this, we say yes. To me this is unbelievable. We have an education bill here is that is turning into an anti-education bill, an antiparent bill, an antistudent bill. We also have other amendments that did away with a whole series of programs and made them optional for schools. 
When Neil Armstrong landed on the Moon he said it was `one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind.' This bill was one, tiny step forward for education, and it has become a huge step 
backward for education. 
Listen to the list of the nationally recognized programs that are done away with summarily in this bill. 
Critical programs for disadvantaged kids including Title I; School to Work; Goals 2000; STAR schools; education technology; Eisenhower professional development, which is teacher training; safe and drug-free schools; magnet school assistance; telecommunications demonstration project for math skills, a fund for the improvement of education. The Javits gifted and talented education funding to support programs for special children is done away with. The Eisenhower regional math and science consortium is done away with. If you read President Eisenhower's comments on what we ought to do in education in the 1950's, he said, `It takes more than guns to make us strong.' We need strong kids and we need them to learn. Yet now we are doing away with the Eisenhower program. 
We are eliminating the International Education Exchange, which supports educational exchange programs. That is what the Gorton amendment did away with, or made it optional. The Gorton amendment took the National Government completely out of education. Education is the most important thing in the world, and this bill is a giant step backward. 
We can improve this bill a little bit if we support the Boxer amendment to support education and reduce juvenile crime. 
I told you before that juvenile offenders commit crimes between the hours of 3 p.m. to 6 p.m. That is why the police in my home state are supporting the Boxer amendment. This includes bipartisan support from the chiefs of police of many, many cities in my State. California law enforcement understands that when it comes to our children, we shouldn't seek party lines. That is why I hope people will vote for this. 
Let's hear what the police chief from Los Angeles says about the need to invest in our children:  
Police leaders know that America's commitment to putting criminals in jail must be matched by its commitment to keeping kids from becoming criminals in the first place. 
Here is another quote from our law enforcement officials. 
`Crime Fighters Support After-School Programs': 
We . . . call on all public officials to protect public safety by adopting commonsense policies to: Provide for all of America's school-age children and teens after-school programs, and access to weekend and summer . . . 
This statement is very, very clear. The organization that made this statement--Fight Crime, Invest in Kids--has 170 of the Nation's leading police chiefs, sheriffs, and prosecutors. Across the country law enforcement officials support after school programs. 
Mr. President, I am hopeful that we will see a little bipartisanship. You all voted for it in the budget. You know what we did. We cut Government travel to pay for this initiative to fund 500 after school programs. The local school districts will design them. They will pull in community groups like Big Brothers and Big Sisters. They will bring in the business community. 
Mr. President, we can keep our kids learning and keep them out of trouble. There is no magic solution to solve all the problems that our Nation is facing in terms of crime. But if we had to choose one way to fight crime it should be to keep our kids engaged when they are in school. 
I really look forward to this vote. I hope it will be bipartisan. 
I yield 2 minutes to my friend, Senator Johnson.

Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask for a minute of my time to say simply that Senator Coverdell criticizes my proposal because it is a new program when he in fact is putting forward a new program. The issue is not about creating a new program. He doesn't like this program, he likes his. 
Senator Coverdell's proposal gives the average private school household a $37 a year benefit; if you are in public school, you fare worse, $7 a year. And he likes the program. That is fine. But he doesn't talk about these deleterious amendments that have made this a very dangerous bill by canceling 20 programs that help our children read and learn. Programs created by President Eisenhower, Senator Javits, tried and true programs, are canceled, put in a block grant to let the locals do what they want. 
The fact is, the local districts like these programs yet this bill seeks to eliminate them. Other programs supported by local districts are rejected out of hand. The Senate rejects putting more teachers in the classroom; rejects any national testing. This is a bill that has now been amended in such a fashion it does harm to our children.

Mrs. BOXER. The Senator is a good debater, so I want to have that opportunity. 
But I also want to respond to the Senator from Arkansas. I am sorry he is no longer in the Senate chamber. He has criticized this after-school program because it is a new program. In actuality this is not a new program. The after school programs that would be funded by this amendment are going on. The local districts are doing a great job, but they need help, and more want to do this. 
The Senator from Arkansas criticizes this program yet his side of the aisle agreed to it unanimously in the budget. We already debated this Boxer amendment, this exact same thing, in the budget resolution. The Senator from Arkansas didn't object to it then. 
In addition the Senator from Arkansas cites a lot of programs that could fund after school initiatives, but those programs are not exclusively for after school; they also could fund senior citizens, parenting skills, or employment counseling. There is no direct program that responds to the fact that after school the crime rate soars and doesn't stop until mom and dad get home. 
Do you know how we pay for this program? By cutting the travel budget for bureaucrats. This seems a reasonable price to pay to protect and educate our children after school.

Mrs. BOXER. My colleague is very generous. I thank him. In rapid fire, I will try to respond. 
The underlying bill really does no harm. As amended, this bill does a huge amount of harm, because it takes the National government out of the whole issue of education for our children. It takes us backward, away from visionaries like President Eisenhower, who said the strength of the Nation lies in its children. The National Government, if it truly cares about its children, should fill the gaps that are identified by local government. And that is what is done away with in the Gorton amendment. 
Essentially, the Gorton amendment is saying to the people that education is not important on the national level. We know if we scratch the surface, many of our colleagues don't want a Department of Education. That is what this is about. This takes away 75 percent of the Department of Education's ability to at least in some way engage in the educational programs helping children in kindergarten through grade twelve. And to say that our children don't need any testing--you just ask the parents if they want testing. How can we talk about accountability without voluntarily testing? 
So, in closing, I thank my friend for his generosity. I hope we will support this modest bill, to bring down the crime rate and lift up our children. It is paid for in the budget, and I look forward to a bipartisan vote. 
I yield the floor.

Mrs. BOXER. Thank you, Mr. President. 
Three weeks ago, my after-school bill was included in the budget agreed to by the Senate. It passed unanimously. Now what we are doing is authorizing the after-school program. It is paid for by cutting Government travel. 
My friends, there is absolutely no national after-school grant program today. The after school program I am proposing today will have total local control. Community organizations and businesses will be brought into school buildings that now get padlocked at 3 p.m. when the juvenile crime rate goes up. That is why 170 of the Nation's leading police officers, sheriffs, and prosecutors endorsed after-school programs, so we can lift up our children and raise their academic performance, and keep them out of trouble. We cut Government travel to pay for this program and use school buildings that are lying fallow. 
I hope we will have a strong bipartisan vote for this amendment. 
Thank you.

Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, in picking up where the Senator from Kansas left off, I think it is important when we recommend a priority, we figure out a way to pay for it. 
I am going to give you and my colleagues in the U.S. Senate an opportunity to cut funding, which is what the Senator from Kansas is very concerned about, out of the Government travel budget--cut that funding by one-tenth of 1 percent--and take those funds away from traveling bureaucrats and put them into after-school programs. 
I know you are a family man with many children and grandchildren. Often we talk about the joys of parenting and grandparenting. I think we all are concerned not only about our own children and grandchildren, but about America's children. I believe that is true across the party line. 
I think if we ask ourselves the question right now, right here, what our children will be doing after school today, I really do not think the answer would come back in a way that satisfies us as U.S. Senators, as parents, as grandparents, and, frankly, as community members. Unfortunately, many of our children after school have no place to go, are alone, get into trouble with gang members, or are lured into gangs. Frankly, if you look at the crime statistics, which I will show you later on a chart, the highest crime rate among juveniles occurs from 3 to 6 p.m. 
Here, we have an opportunity with this amendment, which I am very proud to offer today, to take a stand to fund up to 500 after-school programs for our children and to cut out unnecessary Government travel. It seems to me it is a choice that, as my children say, is a `no-brainer.' It makes sense. 
If you look at the faces of these children, and just look at their hands that they are holding up to answer a question--this is an after-school program in Sacramento, Sacramento START, which I have seen. You can see in the faces of these children that they are interested, that they are engaged, that they are involved, that they are learning. Clearly, being in this program after school means they are not alone, they are not getting into trouble, they are not sitting home alone watching television, waiting for a working parent to arrive. 
I want to show you some other photos of these children. Here is another one from Sacramento START. This program, which my amendment encourages, includes drug counseling and anticrime measures. They invite policemen and firemen and businesspeople in. Here you can see the children engaged with this police officer; they are very engaged in what he is explaining to them. 
I am going to show you a couple of other photographs of these children. 
Here is one from the city of Oakland's after-school program. It is a music after-school program where the children are preteens. We talk a lot about preventing teenage pregnancy and the need for abstinence and the need for our children to understand that their self-esteem is important to them. Here we see the faces of these children and how they are engaged in this music program. Why? Because there was some funding that they scraped together to put together an after-school program. These programs are holding together in a very difficult way, and they want to see the National Government get involved. 
Here is another photo. This one is from Sacramento, also. You can see that this is an environmental lesson. They have, it looks like, a crocodile. The children are engaged in learning about science. 
We love our children in this country. We cannot afford to abandon them just because the school bell rings at 3 o'clock. Our responsibility does not end at 3 o'clock. 
Let me show you the crime statistics. 
When do juvenile offenders commit violent crimes? You can see the spike up at 3 p.m., and it doesn't begin even turning down until 6 p.m. 
If we overlay on this chart after-school programs that keep our children busy, we can see the real need for these programs. I might add that the victims of these crimes are also juveniles. The victims and the perpetrators of these crimes are juveniles. 
I think when we support such an amendment as this, we are not only going to increase the academic performance of our children across the board--and I will explain that--but we also absolutely take a step forward to reducing the crime rate. 
Mr. President, I ask that you let me know when I have 3 minutes remaining in my presentation. 
Let's see what some law enforcement people are saying about after-school programs. This is a proclamation signed by Fight Crime: Invest in Kids. Fight Crime is made up of 170 of the Nation's leading police chiefs, sheriffs and prosecutors, and the presidents of the Fraternal Order of Police and the International Union of Police Associations, which together represent 360,000 police officers. Let's hear what they say about the need for after school programs.  
No one knows better than we---- 
The law enforcement people---- that the most important weapons against crime are the investments which keep kids from becoming criminals--investments which enable all children to get the right start they need to become contributing citizens, and which show them that, as adults, they will be able to meet their families' basic needs through honest hard work. 
What else is being said? Further: 
We therefore call on all public officials to protect public safety by adopting commonsense policies to . . . provide for all of America's school-age children and teens, after-school programs. 
So if you are pro--and this is important--pro-law enforcement, let us not turn our backs on law enforcement, who is urging us provide `after-school programs and access to weekend and summer programs that offer recreation, academic support and community service experience.' 
Let's see what the police chief of Los Angeles has said. 
Police leaders know America's commitment to putting criminals in jail must be matched by its commitment to keeping kids from becoming criminals in the first place. 
We are at a turning point in our country. We now know how important our children are to our future. We now know that if we invest in them, we save 10 times, 20 times on the other end when they are good citizens, when they learn, when they have self-esteem, when they get help with their homework. These are all important things that will happen from my amendment. 
Remember, if you want to fight crime, this is certainly one way to do it. 
What do we say in our amendment? We say that local school districts should design the program to meet the local needs. They will be competing with other local districts across this country. If we get a great application from Ohio and it brings in the police and it brings in the business community and it brings in the local college, all of those things will give that program higher scores. We say that the schools must offer at least two of the following activities: academic assistance; mentoring; recreational activities; or technology training. They have the option of offering any of the following in their program: drug, alcohol and gang prevention programs; health and nutrition counseling; or job skills preparation. 
We also believe that this amendment is setting our Nation on the right track. Across the country we pay millions and billions of dollars for school facilities. We do not use these facilities after school. We put a lock on the door because it is 3 o'clock. So what happens? Our kids leave those buildings and they get in trouble. Then we wonder why we have to build more prisons for our society. 
I would love to see us break this pattern of partisanship today. This is not a program that is new. Education is not new. These programs are out there already. They are working. If we in fact believe that our children are important--the Boxer amendment simply says cut out travel for the bureaucrats. They can take a 
little less travel. Put it into the classroom after school. Our children face many more risks today than our children faced when I was growing up. We know that. We know about drugs. We know about gangs. We know about the war of after-school hours. We know from our crime fighters that we need to get these kids off the streets. 
I want to tell you about LA's Best after-school enrichment program. There are 5,000 students in 24 elementary schools who participate. LA's Best children, well, they just like school a lot more. I have been there. I have seen them. I invite anyone to go there. Some of these schools are in tough neighborhoods and some of them are in less tough neighborhoods. But the results of this program show that the children who participate like school more. Their grades significantly improve. They show positive behavioral changes. There is less crime at LA's Best schools. LA's Best children feel safe. 
Let's hear what the children say. We always talk here about how we love our children. Let's hear what they say.  
LA's Best is the best place to be after school. I like the games and the work. I like going to the computer lab and I like going to the Library. But most of all I like the people. 
Another child says: 
If we didn't have LA's Best, I would probably still be going home to an empty house. 
We used to call those kids latchkey children, home alone after school.

Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, let me tell you about Sacramento START. 
I will close here and reserve my time. 
The children in Sacramento START are showing a 75 percent increase in their grades because they are getting help with their homework, tutoring and mentoring, and they feel good about their lives when they go to Sacramento START. The homework of these children has improved--by 85 percent in quality and completion. 
Why would we not step in to support these important programs? The President has suggested in his budget that we do so, in a much larger way. This is a small, small measure here, cutting out one-tenth of 1 percent of the Government travel budget and putting it into programs such as Sacramento START, such as a program like we have in the Tenderloin district in San Francisco, such as LA's Best, and give our kids something to say yes to. 
Here is the closing photograph, because to me it says it all. This is a beautiful photograph from a program in the Tenderloin district in San Francisco. These are kids after school, loving what they have there in that after-school program, enjoying their life, being kept busy learning, and it shows on their faces. 
I hope we will have an overwhelming vote for this. I hope we will break down this terrible partisanship that is dominating today and cast a vote for our kids, cut our Government travel, go home and feel a little bit better about what we are doing here. 
I yield the floor. Actually, I will reserve the few moments that I have. 
Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mrs. BOXER. Thank you very much, I say to my friend from Massachusetts, for his leadership on these issues. 
I certainly am going to support the Nickles amendment, as the Senator from Massachusetts has stated. The Nickles amendment simply says we shouldn't do anything when we legislate on this issue of a patient bill of rights to make things worse for patients. Of course we wouldn't do that. But the ultimate vote comes on Senator Kennedy's amendment, because that is a positive statement of things we must do and we should do for the average American who has an HMO plan and who deserves to have quality health care. 
I think we should vote for the Nickles amendment and then for the Kennedy amendment. 
I want to tell a couple of stories, because they really illustrate why the Kennedy amendment is so important. 
In the course of looking at the HMO issue, I met a gentleman named Harry Christie from Woodside, CA. He had a daughter who, at age 9, developed a very rare cancer. And it required a very delicate operation that could really only be performed by a surgeon who had experience in dealing with what they call Wilms' tumors. 
So Mr. Christie, as any parent, loving his child with all of his soul, went to find out which physicians could do this operation and found out who they were, went to his HMO, and said, `I assume that you will pay for a specialist to perform this delicate operation on my daughter.' The HMO said, `Sorry, Mr. Christie, we do not have such a specialist on our staff. You will have to take a general surgeon, a very good general surgeon, or you will have to simply pay for this out of your own pocket.' 
Mr. Christie made the argument to no avail: `This is my child. She is 9 years old. This is a delicate operation. This is a rare tumor. And I will not have someone with no experience, no matter how good a surgeon, take a knife to my child.' Well, they said, `You're out of luck.' Mr. Christie had to come up with $50,000, and he did. Years later, his daughter is now 14. She is cured of this disease. She had a successful operation. What if Mr. Christie had not been able to come up with the $50,000? She may never have recovered. 
What is it that we are doing here? We tell people we believe in quality health care, and yet we stand here and say we cannot do anything about it. The Kennedy amendment says that if your plan does not have a specialist that you must have for you or your family, yes, you can go outside that plan. 
We held a press conference on this important bill that we hope will pass the U.S. Senate soon. And we heard over satellite from a gentleman named David Garvey from Illinois. He had an HMO; he thought it was terrific. Everyone loves their HMO until they get sick. Then, unfortunately, too many find out it was not what they thought it would be. What happened to this family is, Barbara Garvey, his wife of 30-some years, got a very rare immune condition. She was on vacation in Hawaii. And the HMO said, `No, no, no, no. We cannot treat her in Hawaii. She has to be flown on a commercial airplane, at your expense, back to Illinois.' Well, to make a very sad story shorter, she never survived that experience because her immune system was so damaged in this particular anemia condition that she could not withstand the infections that she got on that airplane. 
We have to take action. There is nothing in the Nickles amendment that disturbs me at all. Of course, when we take action, it ought to be with all the concerns that Senator Nickles puts in. Of course we should not fix a plan because of political reasons--I do not even know what that means--but we should do it because we want to help the people of this country get quality health care. That means specialists, and that means, as Senator Kennedy has pointed out, a plan where doctors will not be gagged. We do not want doctors gagged. We want doctors to be able to tell you the truth about your condition. And if there is a remedy that might be a little more expensive, you deserve the right to know. That is in the Kennedy amendment. 
A woman who needs an OB-GYN--and many of us use our own OB-GYNs as our first line of support. We do not go to an internist, should not have to go through a gatekeeper, to get that kind of help. So we have a wonderful opportunity today to support both the Nickles amendment and the Kennedy amendment. We have an opportunity to say that patients in America who pay premiums deserve to have the quality put back in health care. This is a chance for us to make that statement. 
I hope we will cross over party lines on both these amendments and go home feeling we have made a statement that is important to the American people and follow it up with real action on a real patients' bill of rights. 
I yield back my time to Senator Kennedy. 
Mr. NICKLES addressed the Chair.

Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I thank my chairman for his many courtesies throughout the evening. I would have appreciated one more courtesy, which would have been accepting the amendment. I want to say to my colleagues that I urge a strong voice vote on this side. There isn't one penny of tobacco money in the budget resolution going for NIH research, and nothing for cancer research. So I hope you will give me a strong aye voice vote, even though I think the result is predetermined because I think with all the people getting cancer caused from cigarettes, it makes sense to use the reserve fund from the tobacco settlement for NIH funding.

Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I strongly support the Market Access Program. I urge my colleagues to support the sense of the Senate amendment, offered by my colleague Senator Kempthorne, to assure funding for this very important and effective agricultural export program. I would like to point out to the Senate why this Market Access Program (MAP) is so important for agriculture in my State of California, and many other states as well. 
Using the MAPs $90 million annual funding level as a fractional offset for the now $214 billion transportation package, has an enormous negative impact on American agricultural export efforts at the very time when our farmers are contending with constricted markets in Asia and increased EU help for competing agricultural exporters seeking to displace American products in the marketplace. 
My objection is not against transportation needs but the termination of an important agricultural export tool. 
The purpose of the MAP is to increase U.S. agricultural project exports. This increase in such exports helps to create and protect U.S. jobs, combat unfair trade practices, improve the U.S. trade balance, and improve farm income. 
The MAP is an important tool in expanding markets for U.S. agricultural products. Continued funding for this program is an important step in redirecting farm spending away from price supports and toward expanding markets. 
The MAP program has been significantly reformed over the last several years to meet congressional expectations--now only small business, farmer cooperatives and associations and state departments of agriculture can participate in the program. The funding level has been substantially reduced to a third of its former cost. It is a cost share program, requiring participants to provide matching funds to qualify for federal funding help. 
And MAP works. The U.S. Department of Agriculture estimates that each dollar of MAP money results in an increase in agricultural product exports of between $2 and $7. The program has provided much needed assistance to commodity groups comprised of small farmers who would be unable to break into these markets on their own. 
Mr. President, the Market Access Program has been an unqualified success for California farmers. For many California crops, the MAP has provided the crucial boost to help them overcome unfair foreign subsidies. I would like to share two of the successes of this program in California. 
California produces about 85% of the U.S. avocado crop on over 6,000 farms that average less than 8 acres per farm. Between 1985 and 1993, California avocado growers utilized $2.5 million of their own money, combined with $3.4 million of MAP funds to achieve over $58 million in avocado sales in Europe and the Pacific Rim. This is better than a 17 to 1 return on our MAP investment that means jobs for Californians. 
The growth of California walnuts exports also illustrates the success of this program. Since 1985, the year before the MAP began helping walnuts, 90% of the growth in California walnut sales has come from exports. And 90% of this export growth has been to markets where California walnuts have had MAP support. The total value of these exports in 1985 totaled $36 million. The total export value has now grown to $119 million. 
We should not unilaterally disarm our export promotion program for agriculture when we are only months away from the commencement of WTO agricultural trade negotiations scheduled to commence in 1999. 
Mr. President, the MAP is a wise investment in American agriculture and I urge my colleagues to support Senator Kempthorne's amendment to support needed funding to USDA's Market Access Program in the Budget Resolution.

Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to allow individuals to deduct up to $2,000 a year for the costs of health insurance (for themselves and their dependents). If health insurance costs are shared by an individual and an employer, the individual could deduct the amount of his or her share. If an individual pays the full cost of health insurance, the entire amount could be deducted, subject to the $2,000 annual limit. 
The Joint Tax Committee has estimated that my bill would reduce revenues to the federal government by approximately $11 billion per year.

 Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, on February 25, the Supreme Court issued an opinion invalidating the National Credit Union Administration's (NCUA) multiple group policy. I am concerned that the Court's ruling may require some current credit union members to divest their credit union membership. Let me explain. 
Section 109 of the Federal Credit Union Act of 1934 provides that `federal credit union membership shall be limited to groups having a common bond of occupation or to groups within a well-defined neighborhood, community or rural district.' Accordingly, prior to 1982, federal credit unions were chartered to serve a single group affiliated by either occupation, association, or residency in a well-defined community. 
In 1982, however, the NCUA altered its interpretation of section 109 to allow federal credit unions to comprise not just one, but multiple occupational groups. For example, a credit union formed by and serving the employees of a clothing store, could also, pursuant to the NCUA's 1982 interpretation, serve the employees of a grocery store or a pharmaceutical company. In 1990, a group of North Carolina Banks, as well as the American Bankers Association filed suit against the NCUA arguing that the NCUA interpretation was contrary to the Federal Credit Union Act. The Supreme Court recently issued an opinion in which they found on behalf of the five North Carolina banks and the American Bankers Association. 
I think it is important to ensure, however, that no current credit union member be forced to give up their membership if they are multiple-group credit union members. I know that my friend and colleague Senator Kerry is also concerned about this issue.

Mrs. BOXER. I would add that the American Bankers Association, to its credit, has said that, despite the Court's ruling, it has no intention of trying to force credit union members who currently belong to multiple-employer group credit unions to divest their membership. I am hopeful, therefore, that Judge Jackson will allow all current credit union members to remain with their respective credit unions.

Mrs. BOXER. I could not agree more. In my home state of California, there are 500 federal credit unions and more than 5 million credit union members. So credit unions have been an extremely valuable resource to millions of residents of my state as well. 
Finally, Mr. President, I think it is important to put into some context the multiple-group charters that the NCUA began approving in 1982. Beginning in 1982, as a result of the economic conditions of the time--the downsizing of companies, the closing of plants, and slumping U.S. industries--the stability and viability of a number of individual credit unions was threatened. Simultaneously, we started seeing the beginnings of an upsurge in the number of small businesses. Those small businesses wanted access to credit union services, even though many did not meet the 500 employee threshold for a charter. 
Thus, multiple group charters became a means of ensuring that those small businesses, as well as low-income consumers lacking access to more traditional financial services, were able to access the services of credit unions. I believe that these groups should to continue to have access to credit union services, whether through individual or multiple group charters.

Mrs. BOXER. I thank my colleague for yielding me this time. Senator Moseley-Braun had to leave the floor, but her leadership on the crumbling schools initiative has just been incredible. She is the one who called our attention to the fact that if our kids are going to learn, they have to have decent schoolbuildings. I was saying the other day we want our kids to learn about gravity by reading about it in the science book, not by having the ceiling falling on them while sitting in the classroom. 
I say to my colleague, Senator Patty Murray, how much I have enjoyed serving with her in the Senate and, beyond that, serving with her on the Budget Committee, because the two of us believe very strongly, as do a number of Democratic colleagues. If everybody is saying children are our priority, education is a priority, and everyone is saying this is so important, then it's time they voted with us and did something about it. 
When my colleague offered her amendment on children in the committee, suddenly our Republican colleagues were not there. I am hoping they are having second thoughts and that when we get to the vote on her amendment, they will come here and support it. We need bipartisanship on this issue. 
Now, I think it's interesting, as we look back on the Federal role in education, to recognize the President who, in my opinion, did more for the Federal role in education than anyone else, in terms of winning public approval for it, and that was President Dwight D. Eisenhower. Senator Murray is a little younger than I am, and I think about that now and then, but I well remember when the Russians launched the Sputnik and the Americans sat back and 
said: How could this be? We were the ones who had the educated work force. We were the ones who had the new technology. How could it be that they could get ahead of us in this way? Dwight Eisenhower came forward, a Republican President with broad bipartisan support, and said the following: `The education of our children is just as important to our national security as the size of our military budget.' He pushed for the National Defense Education Act. 
I say to my colleague, we are following in those footsteps with a series of amendments we will be offering--Senator Murray on class size, Senator Moseley-Braun on crumbling schools, myself on after school, and Senator Dodd on child care. We are following in the footsteps of a Republican President, who recognized in the 1950s that we have to do something about education. 
Now, in terms of my colleague's amendment, I am very proud to support it. I want to say a thank you not only to her, which I have done, but to our President, because our President shared with us his vision of 100,000 new teachers in schools, and everybody sat back and said that is a goal we ought to attain. At least the vast majority of the American people--and we will find out if it is a majority of this body--said yes. This is the same President who had the goal of putting 100,000 police on the street. If you put 100,000 police on the street, which I have strongly supported--what happened in California is that we have a 20 percent reduction in crime because we have community police. If you listen to those community police, let me tell you what they will say. I have had many townhall meetings throughout my State. They say to me: `Senator, we have to prevent a lot of these problems before they start.' Yes, we can help. But the fact is, once a child gets into the juvenile justice system, sometimes we can't turn them around. So we do need to give our children something to say yes to. And law enforcement looks at these measures--in my State at least--with great support. 
I have an after-school bill that I will be offering. We know that, in California, when we give the kids something to say yes to in after-school programs--we give mentoring, tutoring, help with homework, and we bring in business and they learn on computers--their performance has gone up 75 percent in Sacramento's START program and in L.A.'s BEST. There has been a 75 percent increase in performance. Now, we can't expect that for every child, but this is the experience that we are having. 
I submit to my colleague that when you put a child in a smaller class where that child doesn't get lost in the shuffle, where that child gets the individual attention from the teachers, from the teacher's aide, it makes an enormous difference. I sometimes think a lot of our kids' problems are overlooked because the teachers cannot possibly, if they have a class of 40 children, pick up every nuance and problem a child is having in learning or in their social behavior. That issue has come to the floor lately. 
I say to my friend in closing that, in California, in a bipartisan way, the Governor, the superintendent of public instruction, from different parties, all agreed that we should lower class sizes in the lower grades. We do not have the official studies because this is a new program. But the reports that are coming back are extraordinary. The stories we are hearing from the children, from the parents, from the teachers, from the principal, from our Governor, who is a Republican, from our superintendent of public instruction, who is a Democrat, all of what we are hearing is positive. It's not really rocket science to figure out that, if you can spend more time with each child, you are going to have a better result. 
So, again, I say to my colleague how much I enjoy working with her. She has put children first from the moment she came on to the Senate floor. It has been a breath of fresh air for all of us. I really look forward to helping her with this amendment. If we do not succeed today, if the other side puts up procedural hurdles and tells us you need 60 votes, I hope you will keep bringing this issue back again and again and again--for one reason: The 
parents want it, the children need it, and America supports it. 
I thank my colleague and I yield the floor.

Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I want to take a few minutes to talk about an important piece of legislation which is being introduced today, the `Medical Innovation Tax Credit.' I am an original co-sponsor of this legislation. 
The Medical Innovation Tax Credit will establish a new, free-standing credit in the Internal Revenue Code. The credit, modeled after a law in my home state of California, provides a targeted tax incentive for companies to increase clinical trials at medical schools and teaching hospitals. The California law has been successful in encouraging biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies to expand their pioneering research activities at medical schools and teaching hospitals throughout the state. The Medical Innovation Tax Credit will encourage and stimulate such pioneering research in California and throughout the country. 
Many medical institutions today face significant financial pressures as a result of fundamental changes in the health care marketplace. With fewer funding sources available, medical schools, teaching hospitals, and charitable research hospitals designated as cancer centers by the National Cancer Institute (NCI), are having to cut back on their cutting-edge research activities. 
The Medical Innovation Tax Credit will help alleviate some of these financial pressures by encouraging more clinical trials to be conducted at medical schools, hospitals and NCI-designated cancer centers; thus providing these institutions additional private sector resources to fund cutting-edge medical research projects which otherwise may not have been funded. These extra resources will also enhance research and training opportunities, thereby ensuring our nation's continued leadership in innovative medical research. 
Moreover, the Medical Innovation Tax Credit encourages companies to conduct their research activities here in the United States since only domestic clinical trials are eligible for the credit. By decreasing the economic incentive to move such activities off-shore, more clinical research projects will be conducted in the U.S. Such domestic based research will ultimately lead to increased jobs, investments and productivity here at home. 
So, Mr. President, I am very proud to support this bill and I congratulate my colleague Senator D'Amato for his hard work on this legislation. The enactment of this legislation will provide important resources for our nation's leading medical schools, teaching hospitals and NCI-designated cancer centers and it will help ensure America's continued preeminence in innovative medical research. I encourage my colleagues to join in supporting the Medical Innovation Tax Credit.

Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I would like to begin my remarks by commending the distinguished senior senator from California, Senator Feinstein, for her hard work and leadership on this important issue. 
Each year, the President must make a determination with respect to every nation that has been identified as either a major drug-producing or drug transit nation. He has three options: he can (1) certify that the country is fully cooperating with the U.S. or has taken steps on its own against drug activities; (2) decertify the country for failing to meet the `fully cooperating' standard; or (3) find that the country has not met the requirements, but that it is in the `vital national interest' of the U.S. to waive the requirement. 
For the country to continue receiving U.S. aid of various kinds, it must either be certified as `fully cooperating' or a national interest waiver must be provided. 
Last year, I opposed certification of Mexico. The evidence at that time was clear that Mexico had not cooperated fully with the United States in fighting drug activities, either within Mexico or on our mutual border. 
While Mexico made some progress in 1997 in its anti-drug efforts, I believe it has not been enough to warrant certification. 
Mexico is still a major transit point for cocaine shipments from South America. It is a major producer of marijuana and heroin, most of which is shipped to U.S. markets. 
Most disturbing, the drug cartels based in Mexico are as powerful as ever. While some cartel members have been arrested, according to the head of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, `unfortunately, the Government of Mexico has made very little progress in the apprehension of known syndicate leaders.' 
In fact, the cartels are getting stronger. According to the State Department's Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs the Mexican drug trafficking organizations' criminal activities and corrupting influence are `significant enough to threaten Mexico's sovereignty and democratic institutions. . . . They have developed such a level of influence and intimidation in Mexico that the Government classifies them as the nation's principal national security threat.' 
In light of this extremely dangerous situation, I believe the efforts made by the Government of Mexico to respond are inadequate. New laws on money laundering have been adopted, but have not been put into effect. Bilateral Border Task Forces were created to be the primary program for cooperative Mexico-U.S. law enforcement efforts, but were never really implemented, due to corruption, lack of security for U.S. officials, and the failure of Mexico to bear its fair share of the costs. 
Mexico can and must do better in the fight against drugs in order to merit a full certification under our drug law.

Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, one of the consequences of the torrential rains in Southern California has been massive flooding. In the Chino Basin in San Bernardino County, we have a dairy preserve that is home to more than 325 thousand dairy cows. Because of the heavy rains, wastewater wash flows and related manure that are usually stored in lagoons for subsequent disposal, have become inundated causing overflows. These overflows discharge into the Santa Ana River, threatening the underlying aquifer and impairing the water quality. It is important to note that the Santa Ana River is a drinking water source for more than 2 million citizens in Orange County, California. These threats include inorganic salts, parasites, bacteria and viruses and can pollute drinking water with high levels of nitrates that can be potentially fatal to infants. 
I would like to ask Senator Cochran, chairman of the Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee, a question. I have been told by the United States Department of Agriculture that $5 million of the amount requested by the Administration for California from the United States Department of Agriculture Natural Resources Conservation Service Watershed and Flood Prevention Operations, is for the Chino Dairy Preserve in San Bernardino County. Is this the understanding of the Chairman?

I express my deep appreciation to the chairman, my colleagues on the Committee, and the U.S. Department of Agriculture for their support of this appropriation.

Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, as I did during the Appropriations Committee mark-up of the emergency supplemental bill, I wanted to take a few moments and thank Senator Stevens and Senator Byrd for their efforts on this important legislation. Once again, my state of California will be able to rebound from a devastating natural disaster, thanks to the leadership of these two distinguished Senators. 
One of the consequences of El Nino has been extensive damage to the military infrastructure in my state. High winds and massive flooding have left a trail of destruction that must be addressed. This legislation includes important disaster funding that is critical to the readiness of our Armed Forces and to the quality of life of our military personnel. 
I was pleased that the administration requested $50 million in contingency funding for El Nino related disasters. I am also thankful that a portion of these funds have been designated to repair Marine Corps facilities and Air Force family housing in California. However, it is my understanding that damage estimates from California are still evolving and it is likely that the current allotment for California will not be sufficient. 
I would like to ask Senator Stevens, Chairman of the Appropriations Committee, if it is his intention during conference committee to increase disaster funding for California military installations when better estimates from the Defense Department are made available?

Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise today to urge the majority leader to schedule a vote on the nomination of James C. Hormel to be U.S. Ambassador to Luxembourg. He has my strong support as well as the strong support of Senator Feinstein, who has made an eloquent statement on the Senate floor on his behalf. 
James Hormel is a successful businessman, a loving father, and a loving grandfather. 
On October 29, 1997 before the Foreign Relations Committee, I introduced James Hormel for the position of Ambassador to Luxembourg. At that hearing, I spoke of his sharp mind, distinguished career and extensive knowledge of diplomacy, international relations and the business world. Like many of my colleagues, I believe that James Hormel was, and still is, clearly qualified for this position. 
Almost five months later, this nomination still has not come to the Senate floor for a vote. The full Senate has not even had the opportunity to debate the merits of Mr. Hormel's nomination. This is because a hold has been placed on the nomination by certain Senators--apparently because of James Hormel's sexual orientation. 
I say, `apparently' because the arguments some have used to oppose Mr. Hormel do not ring true. 
The main argument is that Mr. Hormel, through his generous history of giving, has donated funds to certain projects--a library collection and an educational video--that contain controversial content. These are not valid arguments. 
First, it is my understanding that many of the books in question, which are found in the San Francisco Public Library, are also in the Library of Congress. Neither Congress nor James Hormel should be responsible for screening the subjects of books found in their libraries. 
And, second, James Hormel had absolutely no input into the content of the educational video. If the content of this video is a valid reason for the Senate to place a hold on this nominee, it sets a dangerous precedent. 
For instance, what if the next nominee that comes before the Senate has given money to his or her child's high school newspaper. And, what if that newspaper ran a controversial article about a particular Senator. Would the Senate then place a hold on that nomination? I don't think so. The holds are in place because James Hormel is gay. 
Mr. President, I believe that the Senate should consider nominees based on their qualifications. If the Senate agrees with me, there should be no controversy over James Hormel's nomination. 
James Hormel, of San Francisco, California, graduated from Swarthmore College and shortly thereafter earned his Juris Doctorate at the University of Chicago Law School. Mr. Hormel served for several years as the Dean of Students and Assistant Dean at the University of Chicago Law School. Since 1984, he has presided as Chairman of EQUIDEX, Inc., an investment firm based in San Francisco. 
For the past 30 years, Mr. Hormel has been a dedicated philanthropist, generously working to support a wide range of worthy causes. For his unselfish acts of giving, he has received several awards and honors. In 1996, he was named Philanthropist of the Year by the Golden Gate Chapter of the National Society of Fundraising Executives. Other honors include the Golden Gate Business Association's Outstanding Leadership Award, the Silver Spur Award from the San Francisco Planning and Urban Research Association, the Public Service Citation from the University of Chicago Alumni Association, and many, many others. 
On the local level, Mr. Hormel is an active member of the San Francisco community working with several important civic organizations. His current projects include the San Francisco Chamber of Commerce, the Human Rights Campaign Foundation, the San Francisco Symphony and the American Foundation for AIDS Research. 
Because of this impressive record, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee approved the nomination of James Hormel by voice vote. And, as a matter of fact, just months before, the full Senate unanimously confirmed James Hormel to serve as a delegate to the U.N. Human Rights Commission. 
Mr. President, James Hormel meets all requirements needed to be the ambassador to Luxembourg. If there is any doubt about Mr. Hormel's qualifications, we should have an open debate on the floor so these questions can be answered. 
In the end, I believe both this country and Luxembourg will benefit greatly from James Hormel as U.S. Ambassador. 
Thank you very much, Mr. President. I yield back the time to Senator Bennett.  
Mr. BENNETT addressed the Chair.

Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, before we bring to a close this reauthorization of the Intermodal Surface Transportation Act, I'm pleased to draw the attention of the Senate to an outstanding trade corridor project in my home state of California. 
The Senate may remember that, in 1996, I worked with the state of California and the California delegation to achieve funding for the Alameda Corridor, a major trade corridor to move the thousands of box cars a day unloaded at the Ports of Long Beach and Los Angeles through southern Los Angeles County to Redondo Junction. From there, the railroads move the cargo east to virtually every state in the Union. While I'm very pleased that we were able to arrange a private public partnership to fund the Alameda Corridor, I must point out that further work must be done to relieve the congestion east of the Alameda Corridor. 
As the trains are loaded at Redondo Junction, they head east, going through a very heavily populated area known as the San Gabriel Valley. In this 35-mile corridor, there are 79 highway rail grade crossings located along the Union Pacific and former Southern Pacific main lines between downtown Los Angeles and the City of Pomona. The train traffic through this Valley is currently 67 trains per day and is projected to increase about 60% to as high as 109 trains per day by the year 2020. This will result in a doubling of the amount of time a grade crossing will be closed, to as high as 140 minutes a day. This obviously has adverse effects on mobility, both for the local citizen and freight movement. More important, however, it has a terrible impact on safety and I believe it is our responsibility to address this situation. 
I am pleased to report that the San Gabriel Valley Council of Governments, working in concert with the Southern California Association of Governments and the California Department of Transportation, has developed a plan to improve safety and mobility in the San Gabriel Valley. It is a very aggressive 8-year, $950 million program which calls for an initial investment of $220 million from the Federal government over the next 6 years. The program is ready to begin immediately with a jump-start program of $60 million, which would address the most critical bottlenecks and improve safety through a series of grade crossing improvements and traffic signalization. In addition to the safety and mobility aspects, if fully implemented, the Alameda Corridor East Gateway to America Project would annually take 128 tons of air pollutants out of the worst air basin in the nation. 
This is a very important project, Mr. President, and I ask that when you go to conference with the House you give this project every consideration in urging the Secretary of Transportation to support this project out of the discretionary monies in the high priority trade corridor program of this legislation.

Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am very pleased to join my colleagues in introducing the Women's Health Research and Prevention Amendments of 1998. This is a bipartisan initiative, which is important, because promoting the health of American women is a bipartisan concern. I commend the Senator from Tennessee for his leadership on this bill. He has done a tremendous job in building crucial and broad support for it. 
I am particularly pleased that the bill includes a title on cardiovascular disease in women, which incorporates legislation I introduced last June, the Women's Cardiovascular Diseases Research and Prevention Act (S. 349). It is appropriate to include it in this comprehensive legislation because cardiovascular disease is the number one killer of women in the United States, a fact many Americans simply don't realize. 
The statistics are alarming. More than 500,000 women and girls die from cardiovascular disease each year. Heart attacks and strokes are the leading causes of disability in women. More than 1 in 5 females have some form of cardiovascular disease. Of women and girls under age 65, approximately 20,000 die of heart attacks each year. Cardiovascular disease claim about as many lives each year as the next eight leading causes of death combined. More than 2,600 Americans die each day from cardiovascular diseases; that's an average of one death every 33 seconds. Cardiovascular diseases kill more women each year than does cancer. Heart attacks kill more than 5 times as many females as does breast cancer. Stroke kills twice as many women as does breast cancer. Each year since 1984, cardiovascular diseases have claimed the lives of more females than males. In 1993, of the number of individuals who died of such diseases, 52 percent were female, and 48 percent were male. 
Yet for years, women have been under-represented in studies about heart disease and stroke. Models and tests for detection have largely been conducted on men, and some doctors do not recognize cardiovascular symptoms that are unique to women. 
The bill we are introducing today authorizes necessary funding to the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute to expand and intensify research, prevention, and educational outreach programs for heart attack, stroke and other cardiovascular diseases in women. This legislation will aid our Nation's doctors and scientists in developing a coordinated and comprehensive strategy for fighting this terrible disease. 
This bill will help ensure that women are well represented in future cardiovascular studies and that their doctors are well informed about symptoms that are unique to women. It will also promote women's awareness of risk factors, such as smoking, obesity and physical inactivity, which greatly increase their chances of developing cardiovascular disease. 
This legislation is a critical component in our efforts to draw attention and resources to cardiovascular disease, which strikes so many of our grandmothers, mothers, aunts and daughters. Through it, and in collaboration with many dedicated groups such as the American Heart Association, we can and will beat this devastating disease. 
The Women's Health Research and Prevention Amendments of 1998 reauthorize several programs that are of great importance to American women, including research on osteoporosis, cancer, aging, and the drug DES. The bill extends authorization for programs that promote health, prevent disease, and reduce domestic violence. I encourage the leaders to bring this legislation to the floor as quickly as possible, so that we can move forward in our efforts to promote the health of women across the nation.

Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, it is indeed an honor to participate in this debate, a very important debate. 
Mr. President, I will be voting against the McConnell amendment, which would eliminate the Department of Transportation's highly successful Disadvantaged Business Enterprise Program. The main reason I am doing it--and there are many reasons--is because this program is of great benefit to small businesses in my State. 
Now, opponents of this program have attempted to label it a quota system. I oppose quotas because quotas are bad policy and quotas are unconstitutional. The people of California feel very strongly against quotas. But what is important to note, as so many of my colleagues have pointed out, the DBE Program is far from a quota program. It is, in fact, a flexible outreach program with goals that bring into the highway contracting industry many small businesses which might otherwise be overlooked or left out. 
Now, this program is so flexible, Mr. President, that no State has ever been fined, no State has ever been reprimanded for not meeting the goal, because there is no quota; there is a goal. 
Now, we know that small business growth has been the most incredible dynamic in California's economic recovery. There is no way--no way--that a Senator from California, in my opinion, should vote against anything that would put a damper on this extraordinary growth. 
What is interesting to me--because I have listened to the debate and I have heard Senator McConnell use the term `race-based' several times--is that white males have always been eligible for the DBE Program. They can participate, as well as, of course, minorities and women. Now, under the new regulations, everyone who participates will have to be certified that they are in fact disadvantaged. In other words, wealthy individuals, whether they are white, whether they are black, whether they are brown, whether they are women--none of them can participate in this program if, in fact, they are not disadvantaged. 
So, Mr. President, it is very clear to me--and it is as clear as it can be--that this program is about assuring every American, regardless of their background, wherever they are from, that they will have a fair chance as small businessowners to participate in this very important highway program. I want to say, as a member of the Environment and Public Works Committee, it really makes me proud to see the leadership from my chairman, Senator Chafee, and the ranking member, Senator Baucus. I think that the two of them have really shown the way. 
I want to also point out that Senator Warner, by adding his strong voice to this debate, is also making a point that in this great Nation the last thing we want to do is put a damper on the growth of small business. In fact, people talk about being colorblind. This program is colorblind. This program is open to all who need to have an opportunity. 
I am very proud to stand with Senators Chafee, Baucus, Warner, and Domenici in casting a vote that will, in fact, allow this program to continue. And, indeed, after I have read the new guidelines that will be coming out, I think this is going to be a program that all of us can be proud of. 
Thank you very much, Mr. President.

Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Sonny Bono Memorial Salton Sea Restoration Act. My legislation will lead to an efficient and responsible restoration of the unique Salton Sea ecosystem. 
Over the years, scientists, communities and politicians alike have been trying to draw national attention to the decline of the Salton Sea. Our late friend and colleague, Representative Sonny Bono, who died in a tragic skiing accident in January, worked tirelessly to make this issue an environmental priority for this Congress. With this legislation, we can carry on that legacy. 
The Salton Sea is a unique natural resource in Southern California. Created in 1905 by a breach in a levee along the Colorado River, the Salton Sea is California's largest inland body of water. It is one of the most important habitats for migratory birds along the Pacific Flyway. 
For 16 months after the breach, the Colorado River flowed into a dry lakebed, filling it to a depth of 80 feet. For a time following the closure of the levee, the water levels declined rapidly as evaporation greatly exceeded inflow. A minimum level was reached in the 1920s, after which the sea once again began to rise, due largely to the importation of water into the basin for agricultural purposes from the New and Alamo Rivers. 
Since there is no natural outlet for the sea at its current level, evaporation is the only way water leaves the basin. All the salts carried with water that flows into the sea have remained there, along with salts re-suspended from prehistoric/historic times by the new inundation. Salinity is currently more than 25 percent higher than ocean water, and rising. 
This extreme salinity, along with agricultural and wastewater in the sea, are rapidly deteriorating the entire ecosystem. The existing Salton Sea ecosystem is under severe stress and nearing collapse, with millions of fish and thousands of bird die-offs in recent years. Birds and fish that once thrived here are now threatened with death and disease as the tons of salts and toxic contaminants that are constantly dumped into the Salton Sea become more and more concentrated and deadly over time. The local economy is also being affected by the disaster at the Salton Sea by the loss of recreational opportunities, decrease in tourism, and the impact on agriculture. 
Despite the urgency of the situation, we do not have the solution at hand and, therefore, must move forward swiftly, but not hastily. The legislation I am introducing today allows the Department of Interior to adequately review all options for restoring the sea and comply with all environmental laws while also requiring tight, yet realistic, time frames. 
I have been working with local and national interests and received many favorable comments on my legislation. Secretary Bruce Babbitt said, `I have had an opportunity to review the Salton Sea legislation that Senator Boxer is introducing this morning. In my judgement, the bill as drafted reflects a more thoughtful and practical approach for addressing the serious environmental challenges that face the Salton Sea. I look forward to working with the Senator in refining and, hopefully implementing this important initiative.' 
John Flicker, President of the National Audubon Society said, `The National Audubon Society strongly endorses this legislation by Senator Boxer. This bill sets in motion a process to determine the source of the ecological crisis facing the Salton Sea and provide recommendations on how to reverse the Salton Sea's rapid deterioration.' 
Senator Boxer's bill represents an important step forward in the fight to save the Salton Sea,' said Congressman George Brown. `She has done an outstanding job building a consensus bill that can win local and federal support.' 
And the Tellis Codekas, President of the Salton Sea Authority and President of the Coachella Valley Water District said, `Senator Boxer is on the right track with her bill. Her legislation builds on a bipartisan local and national effort to save the Salton Sea.' 
I am proud of this support. Under my legislation, Interior will report to Congress within one year on the options for restoring the Salton Sea, including a recommendation for a preferred option. Interior will review ways to reduce and stabilize salinity, stabilize surface elevation, restore the health of fish and wildlife resources and their habitats, enhance recreational use and economic development, and continue the use the Salton Sea for irrigation drainage. 
Interior then has another 6 months within which it must complete all environmental compliance and permitting activities required to implement the proposal. By the end of this eighteen month period, Interior must submit a final report to Congress, at which time the authorization for construction is triggered, allowing Congress 30 legislative days to make changes in the plan, or to stop it. 
We all now agree that we must take the necessary long-term and short-term steps to stabilize salinity and contaminant levels to protect the dwindling fishery resources and to reduce the threats to migratory birds. However, there is no consensus on how that should be done. 
The legislation that I am introducing forces those decisions to be made in a timely manner. But, it is not necessary to waive the provisions of one of our landmark environmental laws, the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, in order to force this process. We must deal with this situation quickly. But, we can take prompt and responsible actions within the framework of environmental laws. 
I would like to thank members of the Salton Sea Authority, including the Imperial County Board of Supervisors, the Riverside County Board of Supervisors, the Imperial Irrigation District, and the Coachella Valley Water District, National Audubon Society, Department of Interior, and Congressman George Brown for their assistance with this legislation. It is with the help and support of local and national interests that I was able to develop this consensus legislation. 
In a December 23, 1998 article in USA Today, Sonny said, `This is our last chance. If we don't move within a year or two, it will be too late.' He was right: the clock is ticking and we must act now to find a solution. Scientists have warned that the Salton Sea will be a dead sea within fifteen years. 
I am hopeful that my House and Senate colleagues and I can act quickly to ensure passage of this legislation to restore the ailing Salton Sea. This is necessary and important legislation that will not only benefit Californians and our natural heritage, but will also carry on the legacy of Representative Bono.

Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation providing for the conveyance of federal land to Stanislaus County, California. This bill is nearly identical to legislation passed by the House of Representatives last November. 
The land in question is known as the NASA Ames Research Center, Crows Landing Naval Air Facility. During World War II, Crows Landing was a flight training center encompassing 1,500 acres and containing two airstrips. Following the war, jurisdiction was transferred to NASA, which now no longer has any use for this facility. Right now, these airstrips are going to waste. 
Giving this land back to the county will promote economic growth and be an important asset to local development. While passage of this bill would greatly serve Stanislaus County, it would also permit NASA to retain the right to use the facility for aviation purposes. It creates a win-win situation for all involved. 
Crows Landing has greatly served this nation--first in the interest of national defense and then to the benefit of the space program. But now, it lies abandoned. We should follow the House and give this land back to the people of Stanislaus County.

 Mrs. BOXER. I would like to comment on the hearing held earlier today by the Senate Judiciary Committee on `Market Power and Structural Change in the Software Industry.' 
First, I would like to commend Chairman Hatch for holding this important hearing and for his leadership on this issue. 
Mr. President, today's creative and innovative software products enable us to bank, conduct research, shop and even trade securities online. And this is just the beginning. It is important therefore, that such a vast and essential resource be allowed to grow and expand in a fair and competitive environment. But recent events had threatened to case clouds over this most fundamental premise. Let me explain. 
On October 20, 1997 Attorney General Reno announced that the Department of Justice would ask a federal judge to order the Microsoft Corporation to cease its practice of forcing manufacturers to sell its internet browser, Internet Explorer, with its widely used operating system, Windows 95. The U.S. District Court here in Washington, D.C. agreed, and on December 11, 1997 ruled that, pending further proceedings, Microsoft could not require purchasers of its operating system software to install its browser software. 
In response to the Court's December 1997 ruling, Microsoft offered computer makers three options: (1) a version of Windows which Microsoft believed did not function; (2) a version of Windows which was more than two years out of date and no longer commercially viable; or, (3) Windows 95 bundled with Internet Explorer. 
Thanks to the Department of Justice's continuing efforts, however, the storm clouds which had threatened an open and competitive market for internet browser software, now appear to be fading. On January 22, 1998, the Department of Justice and Microsoft reached an agreement in which Microsoft agreed to offer computer manufacturers a version of Windows 95 that contained a fully up-to-date operating system without its Internet Explorer internet browser. 
But why should we care about this? 
We should care about this because the biggest losers, perhaps, of any anti-competitive action in the internet browser industry will be the millions of everyday people who rely on the Internet. If one company gains such a huge and unfair advantage, other companies will not be able to compete; there will be no choices and innovation will be stifled. 
This brings up the issue of `open standards.' Open standards on the Internet will allow all access to the Internet without having to rely upon any one company or any one operating platform. Open standards work against monopolies, and ultimately benefit the Internet by increasing competition among software products, resulting in lower prices and a wider selection. 
As a Californian, I am concerned about this issue for yet another reason. Cutting-edge software manufacturers from my home state provide tens of thousands of people with high-paying jobs, making software manufacturing one of California's most valued industries. Industry competition is thus vitally important to my state's interest. 
I appreciate the integral role the Microsoft Corporation has played and continues to play in the information age--its contributions have been most significant and important. It has made computers and computer applications more accessible to millions of people around the world, and for that, it deserves appropriate recognition and credit. Microsoft has been, and continues to be, the leader in the computer industry. But other, smaller, companies must also be given a chance to compete in the best and oldest of American traditions. 
As we move further and further into the information age, the national government must ensure that competition is not eliminated. The Department of Justice should therefore be commended for acting to protect consumers and businesses alike. Similarly, Microsoft deserves credit for agreeing to settle the issue of bundling its operating system software with its internet browser software in what the Department of Justice believed to be a fair and equitable manner. Both made the right call.

Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am submitting today a Resolution urging the Senate to act quickly on legislation permanently extending the employer-provided educational assistance program--Section 127 of the Internal Revenue Code. This provision is particularly important to many high technology companies in my home state of California who are desperately seeking highly skilled employees. Employees to fill key positions in disciplines like engineering, mathematics and computer science. The employer-provided educational assistance program will help in this regard. 
Section 127 of the Code enables employers to contribute up to $5,250 per year in educational assistance to an employee, without that employee having to include such expenditures, made on his behalf, as taxable income. 
Since its inception in 1978, this provision has helped countless American workers advance their education and/or improve their job skills without also having to incur additional taxes; or alternatively, receiving a reduction in their take-home pay. I am an original co-sponsor of a bill--S.127--introduced by Senator Moynihan on January 21, 1997 which would make Section 127 permanent and would also extend Section 127 to include graduate school education. I would note that there are several other bills currently pending before the Senate, introduced by members of both parties, which would make permanent section 127. So Mr. President I would urge the Senate to immediately adopt legislation to make permanent Section 127 and to extend that Section to include graduate school education.

 Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the life of Greg Bayani, a World War II veteran and tireless advocate for Filipino-Americans. Until his death last Thursday, Mr. Bayani spent 52 years working for the day when Filipino veterans would receive the benefits they deserve for serving in the United States Army Forces in the Far East during World War II. 
I join the Filipino community in mourning the death of Mr. Bayani and my heart goes out to his wife, Salvacion and their seven children. In addition to serving in World War II, Mr. Bayani took great pride in serving his community as a schoolteacher and principal in his native Philippines. In 1993, Mr. Bayani retired to southern California where many Filipino veterans currently reside. 
Last July, Mr. Bayani sat directly behind me during a Senate hearing on the Filipino Veterans Equity Act. Having served under General Douglas MacArthur, Mr. Bayani proudly wore his full uniform that day to show his support for this legislation. 
Mr. President, Greg Bayani was one of hundreds of thousands of Filipino soldiers who dutifully served the United States during World War II. These troops fought side by side with Americans during our campaign in the Pacific, bravely defending our democratic ideals. They fought along side American soldiers during the infamous Bataan death march, a journey that claimed tens of thousands of casualties. 
The Philippines were a U.S. possession when President Roosevelt called up Filipino Commonwealth Army forces in July of 1941. Under this order, Filipino forces were eligible for full U.S. veterans benefits. 
After the war, however, Congress overturned President Roosevelt's order by passing the Rescissions Act, which stripped away many of the benefits and recognition that these soldiers earned and deserve. The limitation of benefits was later extended to New Philippine Scouts, units enlisted mainly as an occupation force following the war. We must correct this inequity by restoring the full benefits that these veterans were promised. 
Mr. President, time is running out to correct this clear injustice. It is tragic that the Filipino Veterans Equity Act could not be passed in time for Mr. Bayani and thousands of others who served the United States in World War II. 
This injustice has lasted 53 years. I hope Congress will correct it soon by restoring the benefits promised to Filipino World War II veterans.

Mrs. BOXER. Thank you very much, Mr. President. 
Others have spoken to the merits of the McCain-Feingold bill. They have done so quite eloquently. And I want to share in that praise. Reining in special-interest money is absolutely necessary. Why do I say that? Because this is a Government of, by, and for the people. We learned that in school. It is one of the first things we learned, that Government is of, by, and for the people--not a Government of, by, and for the special interests and the people who are very wealthy and the people who could put on pin-striped suits and come up here and lobby us. 
It is a Government of, by and for the people. It is not for sale. It must not be for sale. We have an obligation to make sure that it is not. We have an obligation to make sure that there isn't even a perception that it is for sale. 
Now, for those who say they don't see the difference between a $5 check, a $25 check, even a $1,000 check versus a $50,000 corporate check or a $100,000 check and even a $1 million check which is allowed under the current system, for those who don't see the difference, I say to them that to me, to this Senator, you are simply not credible. You are not credible. Even if there isn't one bit of a desire on the part of someone giving a $1 million check, it sure looks that way. So we have to have rules in place so that we are not perceived as being a Government that is for sale. That is the soft money. Those are the huge dollars that Senators McCain and Feingold are trying to stop. 
By the way, those are the huge dollars that play a big role in campaigns today. Right now in Santa Barbara, CA, there is a very important race going on. Congressman Walter Capps died while in office and there is a spirited race to replace him, two good candidates fighting it out on the issues. Mr. President, money is flowing in from outside California into this race. Money is flowing in from people outside my State to influence an election in my State and it is flowing in huge amounts, and it is flowing into negative advertising. Mr. President, that does not lift the debate. 
We heard from the senior Senator from California, Mrs. Feinstein, about the need to raise enormous sums of money. She talked about her own decision not to run for Governor because of that. Let me tell you something I have said on this floor before. To raise the amount of money that she would have needed, or I need today to run for the U.S. Senate, would come to $10,000 a day for 6 years including Saturday and Sunday. Now, for 3 years when I got here I couldn't bear to ask anyone for a penny because I had just come from a very tough race and I didn't want to ask anybody for any money, so I didn't get started for 3 years. That means I have to raise $20,000 a day for 3 years to make this budget. It takes time. It takes effort. It is hard. It takes you away from the things you want to do, not to mention the time to think about creative ways to solve the problems that matter to real people. 
Now I agree with Senator Craig that when you ask people what they care about the most, they don't list campaign finance reform. They list education, crime, sensible gun control, Social Security, the environment, HMO bill of rights, pensions. But if you ask them, do you want your Senator to be free of conflicts or potential conflicts when he or she votes on the economy, votes on HMO reform, votes on the minimum wage, votes on sensible gun control, they will say, of course, I want my Senator to do what is in his or her heart; I don't want my Senator to be conflicted in this either in fact or in perception. 
We have a job here to do. My constituents do care. My constituents do write me about this. My constituents do show up at my community meetings and they want me to be strong for campaign finance reform. I get sick, Mr. President, when I hear people come on this floor or on television and say huge money in politics is the American way. They have actually said that--it is the American way. I don't think that is the American way. I don't think it is right to say that huge money in politics is the American way. I think our founders would roll over in their graves. They didn't write a Constitution so that the privileged few could get access or the perception of access. They founded this Nation based on a Government of, by and for the people. I feel sick when I hear free speech equated with money. Yes, I know the Supreme Court said that. But I disagree vehemently with that decision. If someone wealthy has more free speech than someone who is of modest income or poor, there is something wrong. 
So I want to say to my friend, Russ Feingold, and my friend, John McCain, thank you for your persistence. I say to Senators Snowe, Jeffords, and Chafee, thank you for working with us. I 
think we will have a victory here.

 Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise to recognize Dr. Robert Reid, who on February 16, 1998, became the 133rd President of the California Medical Association, the largest state medical association in the nation. With a membership of 35,000 physicians, the California Medical Association represents California physicians from all regions, medical specialties, and modes of practice. 
Dr. Reid's medical career is both long and distinguished. For more than 25 years, he was a practicing OB/GYN, and is currently Director of Medical Affairs for the Cottage Health System in Santa Barbara, California. Dr. Reid has also served as the hospital's Chief of Staff, and was a member of its Board of Directors from 1991 to 1996. Dr. Reid is a Fellow of the American College of Obstetrics-Gynecology and Past President of the Tri-Counties Obstetrics-Gynecology Society. A former President of the Santa Barbara County Medical Society, Dr. Reid also served as Alternate Delegate to the American Medical Association. 
Born in Milan, Italy, Dr. Reid is a graduate of the University of Colorado Medical Center. He lives in Santa Barbara, California, with his wife Patricia, and is the father of four grown children. 
At a time of rapid change in the medical profession, Dr. Reid's leadership will be most welcome. I extend my congratulations to him, and wish him the very best in his term as President of the California Medical Association.

Mrs. BOXER.

To me it is, in a way, a moving moment. So often we stand on the floor and we talk about delays and so on and so forth. But when you put the human face on this issue and you have a woman and her husband and her son and a law firm that was so excited about this nominee, and you add to that 2 years of twisting in the wind and not knowing whether this day would ever come, you have to say that today is a wonderful day. 
So, before my colleague leaves, I wanted to say to him: Thank you for being there for Margaret Morrow and, frankly, all of the people of America. Because she will make an excellent judge.

Mr. President, as I said, I am so very pleased that this day has come at long last, that we will have an up-or-down vote on Margaret Morrow. I really think, standing here, perhaps the only people happier than I am right now are Margaret and her husband and her son and her law partners and the various citizens of California, Republicans and Democrats, who worked together for this day. 
Margaret Morrow is the epitome of mainstream values and mainstream America, and the depth and breadth of her support from prominent Republicans and Democrats illustrate that she is eminently qualified to sit as a Federal judge. I don't think I could be any more eloquent than Chairman Hatch and Ranking Member Leahy, in putting forward her credentials.

Los Angeles Mayor, Richard Riordan, in a letter to Senator Hatch, said: 
Ms. Morrow would be an excellent addition to the Federal bench. She is dedicated to following the law and applying it in a rational and objective fashion. 
Republican judges in the 9th Circuit, Pamela Rymer and Cynthia Hall--they are both President Bush and President Reagan's appointees respectively--in a letter to Senators Hutchison, Collins and Snowe, write: 
[We] urge your favorable action on the Morrow nomination because [we] believe that she would be an exceptional federal judge. 
Representative James Rogan, former Republican Assembly majority leader in the California State Assembly, the first Republican majority leader in almost 30 years--actually he testified in front of the Judiciary Committee and said: 
When an individual asks me to make a recommendation for a judgeship, that is perhaps the single most important thing I will study before making any recommendation . . . I am absolutely convinced that . . . she would be the type of judge who would follow the Constitution and laws of the United States as they were written. . . . [I]t is my belief . . . that should she win approval from this committee and from the full Senate, she would be a judge that we could all be proud of, both in California and throughout our land.

Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I want to say to you again, I know you have been very fair as I presented the case to you, this is a woman that every single Senator should be proud to support today. It is not a matter of political party. This is a woman uniquely qualified. I almost want to say, if Margaret Morrow cannot make it through, then, my goodness, who could? I really think she brings those kinds of bipartisan credentials. 
I reserve my 5 minutes and yield the floor.

Mrs. BOXER. I want to put in the Record an article from the Los Angeles Lawyer, November 1988, that directly refutes the remarks by the Senator from Iowa, Senator Grassley, who said that Ms. Morrow misled the committee and publicly took a stand on initiatives when clearly in this article it is very obvious she wrote about these after those initiatives were voted on in all cases. I think it is very serious that the Senator from Iowa, who is my friend and we work on many issues together, would misstate what occurred.

Mrs. BOXER. I also want my colleagues to understand that the Senator from Iowa asked Ms. Morrow in an unprecedented request which, frankly, had Senators on both sides in an uproar, to answer the question how she personally voted on 10 years' worth of California initiatives. It was astounding. I remember going over to my friend, whom I enjoy working with, and I have worked with him on so many procurement reform issues, and I said, `Senator, I can't imagine how you would expect someone to remember how they voted on 160 ballot measures,' some of which had to do with parks, some of which had to do with building railroads, some of which had to do with school bond measures. And besides, I always thought--and correct me if I am wrong--we had a secret ballot in this country; it is one of the things we pride ourselves on. 
Now, Margaret Morrow has been forthcoming. That is why she has the strong support of Senator Orrin Hatch, and let's read what Senator Hatch has written about Margaret Morrow.

Mrs. BOXER. If I might make a point here. When one is asked if one took a stand on an initiative, one would assume the critical point is at what time you speak out about it. My goodness, if we are forbidden as human beings, let alone the head of a bar association, to comment on what voters have voted on and to talk about ways the initiative process can be improved--and I am going to put into the Record her remarks on that point because she has such respect for the initiative process. She has thought about ways to improve it--if we are gagged as human beings from commenting on what the voters have voted on, this is a sad state of affairs for this country. 
So I want to talk about what Senator Hatch has said about Margaret Morrow. I think it is important. He said it himself quite eloquently at the beginning of this debate. But I want to reiterate because he sent a letter out to all of our colleagues, and he talked about the comment that Margaret Morrow made that has been so taken out of context by my colleagues. 
He said that the committee, the Judiciary Committee, studied Margaret Morrow's response to make a decision as to whether she was an activist judge, and they concluded that her explanation was in keeping with the theme of her speech. And essentially, Senator Hatch goes on to say, `[T]he nominee went to some lengths in her oral testimony and her written responses to the Committee to espouse a clearly restrained approach to the constitutional interpretation and the role of the courts.' 
Then he goes on to say the following: 
In supporting the nomination, the Committee takes into account a number of factors including Ms. Morrow's testimony, her accomplishments and her evident ability as an attorney, as well as the fact that she has received strong support from a number of Republicans.

Mrs. BOXER. So my colleagues have every right to oppose Margaret Morrow. My goodness, it is a free country. They have every right to vote against her and speak against her. But I would like when we have arguments in the Chamber, particularly where 
someone is not present, that these arguments be true, that these arguments hold up, that these arguments are backed up by the facts. 
I want to point out that in several of my colleagues' dissertations here today, they have talked about other lawyers, they have talked about other judges. It is extraordinary to me that they do not want Margaret Morrow, so they talk about three other judges. Margaret Morrow is Margaret Morrow. She is not judge X, judge Y or judge Z. She is Margaret Morrow. She is coming before us, the second woman ever elected to head the Los Angeles County Bar Association, the first woman ever elected to head the California State Bar Association. This is the largest State bar in any State. Republicans voted for her for that position. Democrats did as well. She has the most extraordinary support across the board. 
So when we attack Margaret Morrow, my goodness, don't talk about other judges. Talk about Margaret Morrow. If my colleagues are running for the Senate, they want to be judged on who they are, what do they stand for, not to stand up and say, well, I can't vote for this candidate X because he or she reminds me of candidate Y, and if he gets in, he will act like candidate Y. 
One great thing about the world today is we are all individuals. We are all human beings. God doesn't make us all the same. That is why I am going to vote against cloning. We are different than one another. So when you attack Margaret Morrow, I think you need to do it in a fair way, not by the fact that another judge ruled a certain way. And when I come back to my last 5 minutes, I will continue on this theme. 
I yield back and retain my time.

Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, sometimes I think my colleagues have a very strange definition of activist judge. Listening to them, I think if you have a heartbeat and a pulse, they call you an activist. I mean, I--really, listen to them. 
Are you supposed to nominate a person who has not had a thought in her head, who cannot say, 2 years after an initiative passed, that she thought it was good, bad, or indifferent, who cannot comment on a way to make the initiative process better? 
They also have a way of selective arguing--selective 
arguing. In 1988, Margaret Morrow wrote the following. This is directly from an article in 1988, way before she even dreamt of coming before this Senate. Here is what she wrote: 
Having passed an initiative, voters want to see it enacted. They view a court challenge to its validity as interference with the public will. 
So here is Margaret Morrow arguing that when the voters pass an initiative, they want it enacted. I see Senator Hatch is here, so when I finish my 2 minutes I am going to yield him his 5 minutes. 
I want to say that this is a woman whose practice, if you look at it, is far from anyone's definition of being an activist. These are the areas of law that she has practiced. 
Contract disputes, business torts, unfair competition, securities fraud, directors' and officers' liability, employment law, arbitration law, copyright and trademark infringement, libel, partnership dissolution, real estate development, government contracts, and insurance coverage. 
So my colleagues paint the picture of someone who is entirely different from Margaret Morrow. Mr. President, I just ask my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to vote on Margaret Morrow. Do not vote on judge X, do not vote on judge Y, don't vote on some ideological basis because you think she is going to be a certain way. Follow the leadership of Chairman Hatch, follow the leadership of the many Republican conservatives who have gone on the line to fight for Margaret Morrow. 
I have to say to my colleague from Missouri, thank you for bringing this debate almost to an end. I think I have enjoyed debating you. I wish we could have done it sooner rather than later. But I am pleased that we have reached this day, and to Margaret and to her family, I hope that tonight you will have a reason to celebrate. I can't be sure until the votes are in, but we will know soon. 
Finally, Mr. President, I would just like to continue my response to some of the arguments offered by my colleagues, and set the record straight. On the issue of Ms. Morrow's position on ballot initiatives, there are some people who, having read an article she wrote in 1988, believe that Ms. Morrow holds disdain for citizen initiatives. This is completely false. I repeat--any concerns that Ms. Morrow holds a position other than being 100% supportive of citizen initiatives has no basis in fact. In fact, in that 1988 article, Ms. Morrow expressed her concern about misleading advertisements which provide misinformation for voters. This made it hard, she argued, for voters to make meaningful choices and `renders ephemeral any real hope of intelligent voting by a majority.' Read in context, this statement concerned the quality of information disseminated to the voters, and was not a comment on the ability of voters to make intelligent choices with the necessary information in hand. Ms. Morrow holds the utmost respect for democratic institutions like the citizen initiative process in California. 
In that same 1988 article, Ms. Morrow argued that courts should not be put in the position of policing the initiative process. `Having passed an initiative,' she explains, `voters want to see it enacted. They view a court challenge to its validity as interference with the public will. . . .' Hopefully my colleagues here in the Senate understand that Ms. Morrow merely advocated reforms that would ameliorate problems in the California initiative process. 
For those who may still not be convinced, I would like to read a portion of a letter that I referred to earlier from Robert Bonner, who, as I mentioned, was former U.S. Attorney under President Reagan, former U.S. District Court Judge in the Central District of California and former Head of the Drug Enforcement Administration under President Bush. Mr. Bonner writes: 
The concerns expressed about judicial activism appear to be based on a misunderstanding or misinterpretation of certain articles written by Margaret years ago in her capacity as President of the State Bar of California, the Los Angeles County Bar Association, and the Barristers (young lawyers) section of the Los Angeles County Bar Association. In particular, in 1988, while she was the President of the Los Angeles County Bar Association, Margaret wrote an article concerning the initiative process. The article was critical of the way certain recently concluded initiative campaigns had been run, and suggested ways in which the initiative process could be strengthened by communicating more information to the electorate about the substance of the measures. It also discussed procedural reforms that would assist in correcting the drafting errors that sometimes provide the basis for a legal challenge. Finally, it suggested measures to reduce the influence of special interests and increase the legislature's willingness to address issues of concern to the citizens of the state. 
The article does not suggest hostility to the initiative process; rather it seeks to strengthen the process. Margaret's responses to the Judiciary Committee demonstrate that she unequivocally supports the initiative process and believes that all legislative enactments, including initiatives, are presumptively constitutional, and that courts should be reluctant to overturn them. Margaret explained to the committee her desire to strengthen the process, not make it vulnerable to legal challenge. She also explained that the article proposed ways to make the process more efficient and less costly, so that the initiatives could serve the purpose for which they were intended. 
To anyone still skeptical, I invite you to call Robert Bonner, who believes in Margaret Morrow. In his letter to Senators Bond, D'Amato, Domenici, Sessions and Specter, Mr. Bonner urged them to give him a call with any questions. 
Finally, the California Research Bureau, which is a branch of the state public library and supplies nonpartisan data to the 
executive and legislative branches of the California state government, has much the same role as the Congressional Research Service does for the U.S. Legislative Branch. The Bureau put out a study in May of 1997, entitled California's Statewide Initiative Process, which iterated many of the same concerns Ms. Morrow has about the initiative process in California, and which the senior senator from California, Senator Feinstein, referred to during the markup of Ms. Morrow's nomination. For instance, this impartial, non-partisan research service notes that proponents and opponents of a ballot measure may not have the incentive to provide clear information to voters. Further, the Bureau notes that a number of scholars, elected officials, journalists and commissions have examined the initiative process over the last decade. 
The Bureau cited to concerns about `serious flaws that require improvement,' including limited voter information, deceptive media campaigns, the lack of legislative review, poor drafting, and the impact of money in the initiative process. In other words, Margaret Morrow believes in ballot initiatives, but has concerns similar to those of the California Research Bureau, a nonpartisan research service for the California State Legislature. 
In summary, let there be no doubt that Ms. Morrow supports citizen initiatives as an important part of our democratic form of government. She also subscribes to the position that legislative enactments, including initiatives, are presumed to be constitutional, and that courts should be reluctant to overturn legislation. Margaret Morrow did suggest ways the initiative process could be strengthened by providing more information to the electorate and by correcting the drafting errors that sometimes form the basis for a legal challenge, but she does NOT oppose ballot initiatives. 
On charges that she may be a judicial activist, let me make it very, very clear. Ms. Morrow believes in the respective roles of the legislative and judicial branches, and will look to the original intent of the drafters of the laws and our Constitution. 
Some have questioned whether Margaret Morrow will be an activist judge. Her critics pulled a quote, out of context, from one of her many speeches, and those critics have decided that that single quote is evidence that Margaret Morrow will be an activist judge. The quote in controversy is from a 1- to 2-minute presentation to the State Bar Conference on Women in the Law. She says: `For the law is, almost by definition, on the cutting edge of social thought. It is the vehicle through which we ease the transition from the rules which have always been to the rules which are to be.' 
As Margaret said during her second hearing, the overall context of that speech concerned how lawyers were going to govern the legal profession. She wasn't speaking of the substance of the law. Rather, she was referring to the legal profession. Her point in that speech was if lawyers have to work 2,000 to 3,000 hours a year in order to have positions in private law firms, how will both men and women in the legal profession govern and balance their careers and their family lives? In her speech at the Women in the Law Conference, Margaret Morrow said: `[Women lawyers] should reject the norm of 2000-plus hours a year; the norm that places time in the office above time with family . . . We should work to infuse our perspective into the law--our experience as women, as wives, and as mothers.' 
I would also refer you to the letter from Robert Bonner which so clearly states that he, and so many other Republians of good reputation, can assure you that Margaret Morrow will not be an activist judge. 
Finally, some of her critics base their belief that Ms. Morrow will be an activist judge on a speech she made during her installation as the first woman president of the State Bar of California on October 9, 1993. In her speech, Ms. Morrow quoted Justice William Brennan: `Justice can only endure and flourish if 
law and legal institutions are engines of change, able to accommodate evolving patterns of life and social interaction.' Taken out of context, her critics believe Ms. Morrow will use the courts as an engine of change. However, during her hearing, Ms. Morrow confessed she pulled Justice Brennan's statement from a book of quotes, and she testified that `The theme of that speech was that the State Bar of California as an institution and the legal profession had to change some of the ways we did business. The quotation regarding engines of change had nothing to do with changes in the rule of law or changes in constitutional interpretation.' In fact, the speech was about the changes the bar should make so that it would be more responsive to the public. It did not advance a theme that the courts should be engines of change. 
To respond to my colleagues' charge that Margaret Morrow advocated gun control while president of the state bar, let me just say that this is patently untrue, and is refuted by 11 of the 21 Members of the California State Bar Board of Governors who were on the board at the time in question. They were there, they know what happened and what didn't happen, and they have signed a letter confirming that Margaret Morrow did not advocate gun control as her critics accuse her of. These 11 members are Republicans and Democrats alike. 
These Republicans and Democrats explain in their letter to me that in 1993, the State Bar Conference of Delegates--representatives of voluntary bar associations throughout California--adopted two resolutions calling upon the Bar to study a possible revision of firearms laws and to propose measures to protect judges, lawyers, and others from gun violence. These resolutions were prompted by a tragic shooting incident at a San Francisco law firm in which several people were killed. These resolutions were passed before Ms. Morrow assumed her position as the first woman President of the State Bar of California. 
The resolutions were then considered by the State Bar Board of Governors, of which Margaret Morrow was president in 1993-94. She appointed a special committee to consider the firearms resolutions, saying that she wanted to ensure compliance with the Supreme Court decision, Keller v. State Bar, that forbids a state bar from using mandatory lawyers' dues to support political or ideological causes. 
The Board of Governors, under Margaret Morrow's leadership, rejected the resolutions passed by the delegates and passed explicitly neutral language instead. Let me repeat this very important point. As President of the State Bar Board of Governors, Margaret Morrow led the Board in deciding to reject resolutions on gun laws passed by the California Bar Conference of Delegates and instead adopted a neutral resolution, which suggested that the State Bar sponsor `neutral forums on violence and its impact on the administration of justice.' Therefore, she did the exact opposite of what her critics accuse her of. She followed the law as articulated by the United States Supreme Court, precisely what she will do if she is confirmed as a district judge. 
I yield the remaining 5 minutes to the distinguished chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Chairman Hatch.

Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, earlier today, I submitted a resolution, Senate Resolution 173. It is very straightforward. It condemns last week's tragic bombing of a reproductive health services clinic in Birmingham, AL. As most of us know, this vicious and unprovoked attack killed a police officer and critically injured a clinic worker. We already know that clinic worker lost one eye, and I watched her anguished husband talk about the possibility that she might have an operation on the other eye as well. 
I am very proud that this resolution that I have submitted is bipartisan. I submitted it on behalf of myself and Senator Chafee, Senator Snowe, Senator Mikulski, Senator Jeffords, Senator Lautenberg, Senator Murray, Senator Bob Kerrey, Senator Collins and Senator Moseley-Braun. 
Last week's attack was the first clinic bombing in the United States to cause a death, but, unfortunately, it was far from the first bombing. In recent years, reproductive health services clinics have been the targets of an unprecedented reign of terror. Last year alone, clinics in Atlanta, GA, and in Tulsa, OK, were bombed, resulting in many, many serious injuries. 
The reign of terror began with the murder of Dr. David Gunn in Pensacola, FL, in 1993. A second abortion provider and his 
security guard were shot and killed the following year in Florida, and on the bloodiest day of the antichoice terror campaign, two clinic workers were killed and five injured in vicious cold-blooded shootings in Brookline, MA. 
All told--all told--over 1,800 violent attacks have been reported at reproductive health services clinics in recent years. If I succeed in doing anything with this resolution, it is to make my colleagues aware that the attacks and the level of violence in those attacks are increasing every year. 
I know that reproductive choice is a contentious issue. It was decided by the Supreme Court in Roe v. Wade in 1973. There are people who agree with the decision; there are people who disagree with the decision. And believe me, Mr. President, I have the deepest respect for people who hold a view other than mine. Mine is a pro-choice view. Mine is a view that holds that Roe v. Wade was a balanced, moderate decision that weighed the rights of everyone involved and basically says that previability, a woman has this right to choose, it is a personal decision and Government isn't involved, but postviability, indeed, the Government can come in and regulate as long as her life and her health are protected at all times. 
But I think what is key here is that when someone explodes a bomb in a clinic, this is a violent act. This is not about philosophy, because violence is not a form of speech. Violence is not a form of speech. Violence is criminal. Violence maims, violence kills, and violence hurts the very people who are trying to carry out that cause in a peaceful manner. 
I respect those with a different view, but I have no respect for anyone in this country, regardless of their view, who ever resort to violence as a form of speech. This resolution is not about choice, it is about violence. 
I know that there is not a single one of my colleagues who believes that murder, bombing and terror and acts of intimidation are appropriate ways to express political views. I know that, Mr. President. This Congress stands firm on saying if you commit one of these acts, it is a Federal crime. These bombings are part of a terrorist campaign, a campaign designed to destroy a woman's right to choose through violence, making her afraid to go to a clinic maybe just to get a Pap smear. Maybe it is her only line of health care. Maybe she wants to find out how she can conceive, so she goes to a clinic. Or maybe she is exercising her right to choose, which is the law of the land.

Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise to submit a resolution condemning last week's tragic bombing of a reproductive health services clinic in Birmingham, Alabama. This vicious and unprovoked attack killed a police officer and critically injured a clinic worker. 
Last week's attack was the first clinic bombing in the United States to cause a fatality, but unfortunately, it was far from the first bombing. In recent years, reproductive health services clinics have been the targets of an unprecedented terror campaign. Last year alone, clinics in Atlanta, Georgia and Tulsa, Oklahoma were bombed, resulting in many serious injuries. 
This reign of terror began with the murder of Dr. David Gunn in Pensacola, Florida in 1993. A second abortion provider and his security guard were shot and killed the following year in Florida. And on the bloodiest day of the anti-choice terror campaign, two clinic workers were killed and five injured in vicious, cold-blooded shootings in Brookline, Massachusetts. 
All told, over 1,800 violent attacks have been reported at reproductive health services clinics in recent years. I hope my colleagues are aware that the attacks and the level of violence in those attacks are increasing every year. 
Reproductive choice is a contentious issue. I know that many of my colleagues feel very strongly that abortion should be outlawed in America, and although I strongly disagree, I respect their views and I hope they respect mine. But this resolution is not about choice; it is about violence. I know that not a single one of my colleagues believes that murder, bombing, terror and acts of intimidation are appropriate ways to express political views. 
These bombings are a part of a terrorist campaign--a campaign designed to destroy a woman's right to choose through violence. The United States Senate must condemn these attacks as strongly and unequivocally as we condemn other acts of terrorism--both here and around the world. 
In addition to condemning the attack, this resolution expresses the Sense of the Senate that the Attorney General should fully enforce existing laws to protect the rights of American women seeking care at reproductive health services clinics. 
I am proud to be joined in this effort by a distinguished, bipartisan group of Senators. I hope the Senate can move quickly on this resolution and pass it as early as today.

Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, section 415 of the Internal Revenue Code limits annual pension benefits from multiemployer plans to the average of the three highest consecutive years of income while a worker was covered by the plan. The bill I am introducing today will exempt multiemployer pension plans from the income-based limitations imposed by Section 415. 
Section 415 was enacted in an effort to prevent the `gaming' which occasionally occurred in single employer pension plans. Such gaming occurred when an employee's salary was significantly increased the year before retirement in order to increase that employee's retirement benefits. Single employer plans, unlike multiemployer plans, are generally based upon an employee's salary prior to retirement. Reportedly, from time-to-time, such gaming did occur in single employer plans. 
Multiemployer plans, conversely, are generally based on the number of years an employee has worked, plus the collectively-bargained-for dollar amount of contributions made into the plan. Therefore, such gaming generally did not occur in multiemployer plans. Section, 415, however, does not distinguish between multiemployer plans and single employer plans. Instead, section 415 assumes the salaries of all workers increase steadily over the course of their employment. In fact however, for many workers, particularly those that belong to multiemployer pension plans, there is no such steady increase in earnings. Rather, the salaries of these workers tend to fluctuate over the course of their employment. Because of these fluctuations, the three highest years of compensation for many multiemployer plan participants are not necessarily consecutive. 
Congress recognized this inequity and in 1996, as part of the Small Business and Jobs Protection Act (Pub. L. 104-188), exempted public employee pension plans from Section 415. This exemption, however, was not extended to private sector employees covered by multiemployer pension plans. The bill I have introduced today exempts multiemployer pension plans, single employer plans would still be subject to Section 415 limitations. 
Congressman Peter J. Visclosky introduced similar legislation in April 1997 in the House of Representatives. His bill has bipartisan support in the House. I hope that my bill will receive similar support here in the Senate. Private sector employees, who are covered by multiemployer pension plans, should receive the same treatment as public sector employees. My bill will alleviate the disparity which now exists.

 Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today I want to congratulate California State Senator John Burton as he assumes the role of President Pro Tempore of the California State Senate. 
When I was first elected to the U.S. Congress in 1983, it was the seat of Congressman John Burton in which I served. 
Then, as now, I never forgot his advice to me: `Believe in yourself, follow your heart, and don't be afraid.' 
That advice has never let me down. 
Senator John Burton is an inspiration to many people. His life and success are triumphs of hope and determination. 
It is a widely known fact that Senator Burton struggled with addiction in the past and had to step back from politics for a time to reclaim his life. 
John Burton earned his way back into the political life of California much in the way that he first entered it--as a champion of people too often overlooked or undervalued. 
John Burton's career is a testament to the virtues of loyalty, consistency, courage and service. For all his work and spirit have meant to those he has touched, it is no wonder his colleagues elected him to lead them in the California Senate. 
Even though I can't believe I have to call him `Mr. President,' as a United States Senator, I couldn't be more proud!

Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am very glad that we are moving forward with judges today. We all hear, as we are growing up, that, `Justice delayed is justice denied,' and we have, in many of our courts, vacancies that have gone on for a year, 2 years, and in many cases it is getting to the crisis level. So I am pleased that we will be voting. I think, whether the delays are on the Republican side or the Democratic side, let these names come up, let us have debate, let us vote. 
In that regard, I am looking forward to having our debate on the nominee I had recommended to President Clinton, Margaret Morrow, who has the strong support of Senator Hatch, many Republicans on the Judiciary Committee, and I am very hopeful we can get that nomination resolved. 
I know that our leaders had agreed that vote would take place before the February recess and I will be speaking with both leaders to find out a date certain.

Mrs. BOXER. Thank you very much, Mr. President. This is a forest bill that is very controversial. After I placed my name on it a study came out that basically, in my opinion, led me to believe that the bill in its current form would not be good for the Nation's forests.

Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, last night we learned from our President that the state of the Union is the strongest it has been in decades. The `misery index,' that is inflation and interest rates combined, is at a 30-year low. Inflation is practically nonexistent. The Federal deficit is about to be eliminated. Over 14 million new jobs have been created in the last 7 years. We are seeing the lowest unemployment rate in a quarter of a century at 4.7 percent today. And we have seen the highest home ownership rate in history, nearly 6 million new homeowners since 1992. 
The booming economy and the bright fiscal picture give us a wonderful opportunity to continue to support a balanced budget, but one with a heart and one that makes critical investments in important areas, many outlined by the President--education, health care, health research, the environment, anticrime efforts, child care and, of course, ensuring that Social Security will be fiscally sound well into the next century. 
I am looking forward to working hard, on a bipartisan basis, with my colleagues as we write this budget. I am privileged to serve on the Budget Committee where we will take the first crack at crafting a Senate budget. I also sit on other committees that will carry through some of those priorities. 
I want to point out just a couple of issues that the President talked about which are very near and dear, not only to my heart but, much more important, to the hearts of the people that I represent, the people of California. 
This important issue is after-school care. It is a little-known fact that juvenile crime peaks up at 3 o'clock and begins to go down at 6 o'clock. So, between 3 and 6 our children need something to say `yes' to. They need mentoring. They need help with their homework. The after-school hours are an opportune time for business to come in and teach our young people about business, teach them computers and the many skills that they need to succeed. 
I have written a bill that would set up some model after-school programs. I was debating, should I offer it in the context of education or should I offer it in the context of juvenile crime reduction. After-school programs both improve education and reduce juvenile crime. 
The President is launching a huge initiative there. He is also calling for and end to social promotion, 100,000 new teachers to help our children, and something that is important, reducing class sizes in the early grades. We need to implement voluntary national standards and we must rebuild our crumbling schools and build the new schools of the 21st century. This President is on his way to being the true education President. I want us to be the true education Senate, and I very much look forward to the time we will spend on this Senate floor debating education. 
The President is calling our attention to the current health care crisis. We took a giant step in helping our young people last year, by giving a block grant to the States. They are going to work on making sure our children are insured. 
There is a big gap between the ages of 55 and 65, while people are waiting to get into Medicare, and the President proposes a pay-as-you-go system to handle some of those people, to allow them to buy into Medicare. I want to emphasize this is a pay-as-you-go system. We have heard criticism that we can't do anything to expand Medicare without harming Medicare. I don't think there is anyone in the Senate who would do that. We want to make sure that anything that we put forward pays for itself. 
The President also touched on the rights of health care consumers to get quality health care from HMOs. These health maintenance organizations often deliver care in a very efficient manner. The question is, is the quality there? I wrote a bill, the Health Care Consumers' Bill of Rights Act, which parallels a lot of what the President talked about. I hope we can enact a patient's bill of rights this year. 
When I was in my State, I had the good fortune to meet with a gentleman named Harry Christie, who had a poignant story to tell. His daughter Carley at age 9 was diagnosed with a rare and aggressive form of kidney cancer. His HMO refused to allow him to take that child to a pediatric surgeon who specialized in this very delicate operation. So, Mr. Christie was faced with a terrible choice. What to do? He dug into his own pocket, he somehow got the thousands of dollars--$40,000 to be exact--to pay for Carley's operation. This story has a happy ending. Carley had the operation. She is 14 years old. She is cancer free. But only because her dad went against the HMO. 
I don't want to see any other parent in America go through that torture. If there is a specialist available to handle a crisis, anyone in this country who has health insurance should be able to go to that specialist. That would be part of the patients' bill of rights. 
I am ready to work with my colleagues to develop a consensus HMO reform bill that we can pass and send to the President for his signature. In the end, it doesn't matter whose name is on the bill. I do not care if it is a Democratic bill or a Republican bill. Our task is simply to get the job done. I look forward to working on this legislation and I hope the Majority Leader will schedule action on it this year. In my view, HMO reform must be a top priority of this session of Congress. 
In the crime area, I will be urging my colleagues in the Senate to agree to legislation that will require all makers of handguns to include child safety locks in the weapons. The President proposed this last year, a number of manufacturers have voluntarily complied, but I want to ensure that all of them do. 
I will also continue to make the case for my legislation to ban the manufacture and sale of `junk guns' or `Saturday night specials', which are cheap, poorly made guns that are so often used in the commission of crimes. I realize that the chances of such legislation passing are low, given the current makeup of the Congress, but I think that it is important to raise the issue, nevertheless. 
As a member of the Environment and Public Works Committee, I will be working a number of bills that are of great importance to the people and communities of my state, including reforming the Superfund program to clean up contaminated sites across the country. 
I will seek opportunities to enact my legislation, the `Children's Environmental Protection Act', which would require all of our environmental health and safety standards to be set at levels that would ensure protection of children, the elderly, and pregnant women, and other vulnerable groups. It would also require the EPA to establish a list of `safer-for-children' products such as pesticides and household cleaners, to give concerned consumers more information on the products found in all American households. 
I also applaud and will work to enact the President's `Clean Water Initiative', which will provide substantial new resources to fulfill the promise of the Clean Water Act to give all Americans clean, safe lakes, rivers and coastal waters. 
Sometime in the next few weeks, the Senate is expected to take up the transportation infrastructure bill--ISTEA--and I look forward to that debate. Californians are anxious to see quick action on that legislation, which provides funding for highway, transit, and other transportation projects throughout the state. 
Last night, the President announced that his budget, which he will submit to Congress next week, will be in balance beginning in fiscal year 1999. The Budget Committee, of which I am a member, began its hearings on the state of the economy and the federal budget this morning. I believe that we can balance the budget next year, and I will work to ensure that it happens. Hopefully, we can start seeing budget surpluses in future years. But I want to be very clear about that: before we do anything else, we must ensure the integrity of the Social Security trust fund, so that baby boomers and future generations can count on getting the benefits for which they have contributed all their working lives. 
Within the context of a balanced budget, I believe we have the resources for limited, targeted tax reduction. I will introduce a bill in the next few days to provide a tax deduction for the cost of buying health insurance to people whose employers do not provide health plans and for those who are unemployed. 
There are many other issues I could go into. I see my friend Senator Grams is here. We just spent about an hour together in the Budget Committee. I am sure he has some valuable issues to lay out for the Senate. But I do think it is important to know--and I am putting it in very blunt terms--that although we celebrate a balanced budget, if it weren't for the surplus of Social Security that we are borrowing, we would still be in debt. It is time to pay back the Social Security trust fund. You know, there are many trust funds that we have, that we should pay back--they are much smaller than Social Security; we can do it easily--the Land and Water Conservation Fund, the Aviation Trust Fund, the Highway Trust Funds. Those are small. We can pay them back. But Social Security is large. 
If you owe a debt to someone in life you have to pay him or her back. When I have young people standing up at my community meetings, looking me in the eye, who say, `Can you tell me Social Security will be there when I need it? I'm 30 years old and I'm not sure.' I tell them when I was 30 I wasn't sure Social Security would be there. But because of the policies of the Senators, the Congress, the Presidents of both parties, Social Security will be there for me and my family. `I assure you,' I said to this last gentleman that mentioned it, `it will be there for you. But only if we heed what President Clinton said.' 
We have to pay back the Social Security trust fund and then we will have something to be very proud of. We will look back at this time in our history and the people will say about us that we made the right investments in the right things. They paid dividends. They made our people strong and our country strong. And, yes, we saw a looming problem called Social Security and Medicare and we acted to shore up those funds to make sure that future generations will have what this generation has--peace and security. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I think the Senator from West Virginia, Senator Rockefeller, made a very strong plea for giving the President fast track. I find it interesting that those who support fast track say those who do not, in this case, oppose trade. I think the truth is there are those who support fast track on any given occasion, and there are some who oppose it on every given occasion. I find myself in the middle of the road here, where I have given fast-track authority to Presidents when I felt it was in the best interests of our country, of our working people, and of our environment. That is usually when trade is being is being negotiated with countries that have decent labor standards, decent prevailing wages, and decent environmental standards. 
So on that topic, I think it is simplistic to say that either you are for trade or against it. I think we are all for trade. I think the question is, is it fair to America? Will it result in good-paying jobs or will it put the squeeze on jobs? And should we give up our authority here in the Senate and the House, should we give that up regardless of whether it is a President of my own party or another party? Or should we hold on to that authority so we can, in fact, stand up for American values and American workers and American interests? 
As we reach the end of this session of Congress, I would like to comment on a couple of the issues that we have taken up in the Senate and look ahead for some issues I hope we will take up when we return. As one of the two Senators from the largest State in the Union, every single thing that we do here and every single thing we fail to do here has a major impact on my State. It has 33 million people, more seniors than any other State, more young people than any other State, more workers than any other State, more women than any other State, more infants than any other State. 
So whatever issue we turn to here impacts my people enormously. 
I share pride in knowing that I was able to work with a majority of my colleagues to bring a balanced budget, but one with a heart, to the U.S. Senate and to the President's desk for signature. The march toward fiscal responsibility in this country was actually started when President Clinton took the oath of office. I remember that day because we were filled with promise and hope that we could finally tackle some of our problems. And we did. 
I might say it was a tough year for Democrats, because we didn't get any bipartisan help in that budget. But that budget in 1993 was the budget that led us to fiscal responsibility. It took us down that fiscally responsible track. I remember, because I am on the Budget Committee, hearing the comments of my Republican friends at that time that this budget was a disaster, that President Clinton's policy would lead to unemployment, recession, depression--everything bad that you could think of. We persevered and we believed in what we were doing, and I am happy to say that this year we finished the job with our Republican friends. Gone are the days of Government shutdowns, because the American people spoke out in that last shutdown and said: You were sent here to do your job. We want fiscal responsibility but we are not going to have our budget balance on the backs of our grandmothers and grandfathers, our children, the most vulnerable people. We are not going to balance the budget while hurting education and the environment. So the budget agreement took all that into consideration. I think we all have a lot to be proud of. 
As we moved forward on the fiscal responsibility front, unfortunately I saw us move backward in a number of areas. I want to touch on those. 
In 1973, Roe versus Wade was decided. It is the law of the land. Yet this Congress is constantly trying to roll the clock back to the days when women were in deep trouble in this country because abortion was illegal. We know that there is not the will to have a vote to outlaw abortion because the votes are not there, and the American people would be stunned if a woman's right to choose was completely denied. So what the opponents of a woman's right to choose have done is to chip away at that right. And there are many women in this Nation who have their choice imperiled. Who are these women? Women in the military, women in the Federal work force, poor women in America--all women in America, because fewer and fewer hospitals are teaching doctors how to perform safe, legal abortion. 
I don't know why we have to keep turning back the clock to the days when women were in trouble in this country. Why don't we move on? I have a bill that would codify Roe versus Wade. I am looking forward to talking more about that next year. It seems like there is a group that wants to reopen that battle all the time. They want to reopen the battle over Medicare. They want to fight us on issues that already were fought in the 1950's. That's when Dwight David Eisenhower said the National Government ought to have a role in education. In the 1960's, that's when President Johnson said Medicare is important. In the 1970's, that's when President Nixon said we need an Environmental Protection Agency. 
I think America does better when we move forward. So I am hoping when we get back here we will complete some unfinished business. First of all, we should fill up all the judgeships that are languishing. Justice delayed is justice denied. We have very fine people waiting to be confirmed by this U.S. Senate. I am very pleased that we did pass a number through, but there are a number left to go. I am very pleased Senator Lott has worked with Senator Daschle and we will have a vote on Margaret Morrow. But we need to do it. We must also confirm the nomination of Bill Lann Lee to be Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights. We cannot allow this important position to remain unfilled while such a superb nominee is ready, willing, and able to assume to the job. 
We also need the IRS reform that Senator Bob Kerrey spoke about so eloquently. And we need passage of campaign finance 
reform, the McCain-Feingold bill. 
Let's place some national standards on our HMO's and ensure that all Americans enrolled in managed care plans receive quality treatment and are always treated fairly by insurance companies. 
We need to pass the transportation bill, not just for 6 months, but for 6 years. Our people need highways built. They need transportation systems that work. We owe it to them. 
We must make stopping gun violence a national priority. Junk guns have no place on our streets. And we must ensure that all handguns in America are sold with a safety lock. Taking this step would save hundreds of lives every year. 
Let's make a national priority of health research. That is what the people want. They want a cure for Alzheimer's, AIDS, breast cancer, prostate cancer, scleroderma, ovarian cancer--these are the things they so worry about with their families today. Let's make a priority of health research. 
He is our leader on doubling the National Institutes of Health. He has teamed up with Senator Connie Mack on this. It is time that we do this. The American people need it. 
We need some minimum standards for day care. Senator Durbin was on the floor today eloquently speaking about the needs of those infants and those toddlers and how the brain develops. By age 3, 90 percent of the brain is developed. Yet, we have no national standards for child care in this Nation. 
So I think it is time that we looked at certain issues. We say children are our priority. Let's pass the Children's Environmental Protection Act and protect them from pollution. We have seen a 30-percent increase in brain tumors among our young children in the last 10 years. 
We need national standards for education. We had a good compromise in the U.S. Senate, and the House would not accept it. What are we afraid of? Why wouldn't we want our parents to have a chance to see whether their children are reading at the proper level, doing math at the proper level? If we really care about our children, let's put some responsibility on the teachers, and this is one way I think we ought to do it. 
Superfund reform. We have toxic waste dumps all over this country. We need to clean them up. The law needs to be refined. Too much money goes to attorneys and not enough to clean up the mess. The polluter has to pay. We can't allow the taxpayers to pick up the tab. We need to move forward. 
In closing, I want to say this. We are going to be celebrating Veterans Day on November 11. It is a special, special day. It also happens to be my birthday, and I am very proud to share it with the veterans. 
Year in and year out, we hear about how many of the homeless in our streets are veterans. Mr. President, how can we, as the United States of America, celebrate Veterans Day knowing that so many of our vets have been turned aside? 
I hope we will move on that and on the gulf war syndrome. We cannot turn our back on veterans who served our Nation in wartime and came back sick. 
We did it in Vietnam when our veterans were exposed to agent orange. We did it again with gulf war syndrome. We ought to hold our heads up as a nation this Veterans Day. 
I really look forward to coming back here and righting some of these wrongs. Senator Rockefeller has a great bill. It says if you are a gulf war veteran and suffer from a disease, you don't have to prove anything except you were in that war theater and you are now disabled in order to qualify for disability benefits. It seems to me if we stand for anything around here, it ought to be standing by our veterans when they are sick and when they are homeless. 
So I leave here with a good feeling about a lot of what we did and a little bit of regret about some other things I didn't agree with. But I am excited as I think about coming back here, because I think you heard me describe that there are a number of issues we ought to address that will make life better for all of our people in the context of a balanced budget that has a heart. 
Thank you very much, Mr. President. I yield the floor.

Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am very pleased to be here, even though it is 7 o'clock on Sunday night, to finally finish up the D.C. appropriations bill. When Senator Faircloth and I started working together on this, it was way back in the summertime, and in September our bill, this D.C. appropriations bill, was voted out of committee. 
It was very easy to do that because the mayor, the city council, the control board, all agreed on the D.C. budget. We basically put it in this bill and we followed on the authorizing committees which had passed the National Capital Revitalization and Self-Government Improvement Act. So what we did was to carry forward the will of this Congress and the will of the people of D.C. as repleted by their control board, their city council, and their mayor putting together a consensus balanced budget. 
That all was fine until we came to the floor and, of course, suddenly this bill became a very attractive sort of Christmas tree, way before Christmas, and Senator Faircloth and I found ourselves looking at each other as the debate swirled around us on immigration, on school vouchers and other things that we really did not anticipate being a part of this bill. 
The two of us had very much wanted to move it forward, and I was very candid at the time that there were a couple of provisions in this bill that I was not happy about because I did not think it showed enough respect for the women of D.C. in terms of their right to choose and to those who are seeking recognition of domestic partners, which I think is a local issue. 
But I stated at that time that majority rules, and I was not going to hold up the bill because I did not agree with these things, and so we were ready to move forward. 
I am very pleased tonight that we have a resolution on the immigration portion. It was a very legitimate issue that was raised by Senators Kennedy, Mack, and Graham, and I think Senator Abraham was very eloquent on the point that there were in fact refugees who came from Nicaragua, Cuba, El Salvador, and Guatemala who were going to be thrown out of the country without any sort of hearing whatsoever. Senator Moseley-Braun has raised the issue of Haitians in a similar situation. Although this bill is silent on that, I think we have found other ways to handle her concerns. So it appears to me that we are on our way to having a bill for the people of Washington, DC, and the children of Washington, DC, who desperately deserve to have this bill completed. 
The issue of vouchers was handled, I thought, in quite a diplomatic way, which was to remove it from this bill and send it forward to the President as a separate vehicle. I think that really is a way to resolve the problem which right now is very contentious on both sides. 
So, Mr. President, I do not have any further comments to make at this time. I stand ready with my colleague from North Carolina to vote on this tonight. I understand we will voice vote it. I understand there are some colleagues who have other things they wish to discuss. I know Senator Wyden had a provision in the bill, which I strongly supported, dealing with the end of anonymous holds that we have had as a Senate prerogative around here. That appears to be an issue of contention that is no longer in the bill. 
So at this time I retain the remainder of my time in case colleagues come over and need it, but at this time I yield the floor. 
Mr. President, with the understanding that Senator Stevens is going to enter into a colloquy with Senator Wyden, I yield back the remainder of my time.

Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I congratulate the chairman and ranking member of the Appropriations Committee for bringing this bill to the Senate. Their leadership will help break the logjam on the remaining 1998 appropriations bills, and I commend them for pushing forward. 
While I support most provisions in this multi-title legislation, I must take this opportunity to register my strong disapproval of the provisions in the Foreign Operations title relating to International Family Planning. 
The bill provides that for the next two years, it will include the restrictive Mexico City policy, which will prohibit U.S. international family planning assistance from going to any foreign private organization involved in certain abortion-related activities--even though these activities are carried out with non-U.S. funds. This language will cripple the work of many of the private organizations doing the most effective work in family planning and maternal and child health. For example, organizations that seek to advise their governments on how to make abortions safer for women, in countries where abortion is legal, would be restricted from doing so if they receive U.S. money for family planning services. This restriction will only result in more dangerous health conditions for women. 
The Mexico City provision does at least include a waiver provision, allowing the President to disregard the policy. However, if he chooses to exercise the waiver, the family planning account will be penalized by being reduced. 
Unfortunately, this language is a compromise with those who would terminate international family planning altogether, and thus it is probably the best we can do. I commend the Senator from Vermont, Senator Leahy, for working so hard to get the best language possible at this time. However, Mr. President, this compromise must go no further. Any movement beyond the language we have included in the Senate bill will, in my view, seriously jeopardizes passsage of the legislation.

The Senator is so correct when he says that the Senate has spoken, the House has spoken, and suddenly we find ourselves faced with a situation where the funds for family planning on an international scale will be withheld. 
I say to my friend, for the Record, because I think it is very important and a lot of people are counting on us, can our friend from Vermont assure us that this agreement that he has garnered working with Senator McConnell is, in fact, the best he thinks he can get at this time?

Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Health Insurance Consumer's bill of rights. I have been working closely on this bill with Congressman Chuck Schumer, who has introduced companion legislation in the House. 
Our will address an increasing crisis of confidence in our Nation's health care system. This crisis of confidence is especially evident for the increasing number of Americans enrolled in managed care health plans. 
A recent survey conducted by the Henry Kaiser Family Foundation and Harvard University found that only 44 percent of enrollees in managed care health care plans believe it is very likely that necessary treatments would be covered if they became seriously ill. Fully 69 percent of enrollees in traditional fee-for-service plans believed they would be adequately covered. 
The survey found that the American people hold managed care plans generally in low esteem and they support efforts to improve the health insurance system. That, Mr. President, is exactly what the Boxer-Schumer bill aims to do. 
The Health Insurance Consumer's bill of rights requires all health insurance plans to meet basic requirements for conduct, coverage, and consumer disclosure. 
Specifically, the bill requires that all managed care plans have an adequate number of primary care physicians and specialists to meet the health care needs of their enrollees. It requires health plans to cover emergency care, terminate so-called gag rules that limit communication between a doctor and a patient. It requires the annual disclosure of a wealth of important consumer information to enrollees and potential enrollees, and finally, this bill contains a number of important provisions to ensure that women are treated fairly in managed care plans. 
I want to make clear that the Schumer-Boxer bill is not antimanaged care. On the contrary, the bill accepts that managed care plans are the chosen kind of coverage for millions of Americans. It is precisely for that reason that Congress must act to ensure that managed care plans act responsibly and provide quality coverage. 
I hope the Senate will consider this bill carefully and act upon it early next year.

 Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate the Walt Disney Co. for being honored as the 1997 Corporation of the Year by the Minority Business Enterprise Input Committee of the Southern California Regional Purchasing Councils [SCRPC], a group of 225 large-scale purchasers located in a 13-county area of southern California. 
Formed in 1975, SCRPC seeks to stimulate economic growth and help develop enterprises that can provide useful goods and services at competitive prices, increase employment for underemployed groups, and help bring disadvantaged enterprises into America's market economy. 
The Walt Disney Co. earned this prestigious award through its leadership in working with minority-owned businesses. Disney has operated a Minority and Women Business Enterprise Program for more than 15 years, and now does business with more than 900 minority-owned and 600 female-owned businesses. 
This special recognition by the SCRPC reflects the high regard suppliers have for Disney's outreach and diversity policies. 
It is a great pleasure to honor and recognize the initiative and leadership that has led to this outstanding honor for the Walt Disney Co.

 Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today I would like to recognize Pietro Parravano, a remarkable individual who has distinguished himself not only as an outstanding commercial fisherman, but as an eloquent ambassador for the fishing industry, regionally, nationally, and abroad. 
A graduate of Eastern Michigan University, Mr. Parravano was an instructor of physics before becoming an active commercial fisherman 15 years ago. Mr. Parravano sails his vessel, the F/V Ann-B, from the port of Half Moon Bay in northern California. 
A leader in the community, Pietro Parravano has represented the fishing industry in a variety of capacities. He has served as president of the Half Moon Bay Fishermen's Marketing Association, president of the Pacific Coast Federation of Fishermen's Associations, and chair of the Institute for Fisheries Resources. He is also a member of both the Local Fisheries Impact Program and the California Seafood Council. 
Mr. Parravano has often played an important role in shaping sustainable fishing policies. He was appointed by the Governor to the Bay-Delta Advisory Committee, has been elected commissioner to the San Mateo County Harbor Commission, and will soon serve as a United States delegate to the World Forum of Fish Harvesters and Fishworkers to be held in India. 
Time and again, his colleagues, the community, and the Government have trusted Pietro Parravano to represent the interests of fisher men and women. 
It is my pleasure to congratulate Pietro Parravano upon receiving the 1997 Highliner of the Year Award, the fishing industry's highest honor. 
Mr. Parravano is a credit to the fishing industry and to the State of California. I applaud his record of outstanding and dedicated public service and extend to him my sincerest appreciation for his commitment to sustainable fishing and the betterment of the lives of fishing men and women.

 Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, the Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education appropriations bill that the Senate passed yesterday provides the National Institutes of Health and other Government health initiatives with funding needed to continue their work on diseases that afflict so many millions of Americans. I am glad to see that this budget will continue to place a priority on health research and, in particular on women's health. Although we have seen many advances in women's health over the past several years, much more progress needs to be made especially on such intractable problems as breast cancer. 
The key to successful breast cancer treatment is early detection. Mammography has been and will continue to be a key diagnostic tool in early detection for women in the high-risk category for breast cancer. Digital mammography is the next generation technology in mammography imaging for cancer, and it offers a number of advantages over the current film technology, including: improved image quality and diagnosis; improved lesion visualization; lower overall cost of image storage and retrieval; and increased use of telemammography as a means to facilitate expert consultations. 
There is a second generation digital mammography technology on the drawing boards that offers the prospect not only of improving the ability of radiologists to identify lesions in the breast, but also of significantly reducing the cost of digital mammography. One such approach, a Metal-Halide technology, holds out the promise of meeting these goals. This technology has the potential to result in an imager that could be used to replace the film imagers in existing mammography machines--rather than needing to replace the entire mammography machine. 
There are significant technical hurdles that must be overcome before a product of the necessary quality of resolution for mammography can be introduced. The research and development risk may be too great for private sector companies to move forward, thus making it ideal for a Government-industry partnership. 
I urge the administration to consider addressing this issue in its fiscal year 1999 budget by creating a program that would focus on key technologies that could improve women's health. This new program could place particular emphasis on technologies that will make a significant difference for women, have a high likelihood of near-term commercial development, and are likely to see widespread and rapid diffusion throughout the medical community. 
Mr. President, the war on breast cancer and many other diseases has not been won. In the private and public sectors, we must be creative in looking for new approaches to address and overcome these challenges. It does little good if we make a breakthrough in the lab or corporate research facility, if we can't bring that breakthrough to market in such a way that the maximum number of people benefit. I hope the administration will give careful consideration to these kinds of new and innovative ideas in crafting its budget for the upcoming fiscal year.

Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, the U.S. Senate showed its overwhelming support today for Christina Snyder, one of the most qualified legal minds to fill a seat on the Federal bench of the Central District of California. My unwavering confidence in Ms. Snyder arises from respect for her background, education and career. I am very pleased she has been confirmed. 
Ms. Snyder is a native of the Los Angeles area, having grown up in the Montebello community in East Los Angeles. She studied in the public elementary schools of Montebello and Orange County, and was valedictorian of her high school class. She later studied at the University of California at Los Angeles, before transferring to Pomona College where she earned her undergraduate degree. She earned her law degree at Stanford University. 
Mr. President, I am sure you are aware Ms. Snyder's legal background is highly respected throughout the State of California. Ms. Snyder has distinguished herself in the legal community of Los Angeles through more than 20 years of law practice. Ms. Snyder began her career working at the Los Angeles law firm of Wyman, Bautzer, Kuchel and Silbert, where she eventually was made a partner. She later went on to become a law partner at two other Los Angeles law firms. Her nomination and election to the highly regarded American Law Institute in 1993 is further evidence of the respect she commands within the legal profession. 
Moreover, Ms. Snyder has demonstrated a strong commitment to community service as one of the founding members of Public Counsel, a public interest law firm of the Los Angeles County and Beverly Hills Bar Associations. She also served as the California State Bar designee on the Board of Directors of the Western Center for Law and Poverty. 
Again, I am pleased to speak in favor of Ms. Snyder and feel she is a valuable addition to the Federal bench.

Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I personally say to Senators Lott and Daschle an enormous thank you for working out an agreement by which we can vote on another extraordinary woman, Margaret Morrow, and make sure that vote will take place before the February break. 
We have had one or two Senators who put anonymous holds on this nomination. I am happy to say they decided to come out and talk about why they don't feel it is a good nomination, because at least we know who is objecting to Margaret Morrow. 
Those two Senators and I have spoken. We have written to each other extensively, and they have agreed that it is only fair that there be a vote on Margaret Morrow. She has the support of Senator Hatch. She has the support of many members of the Judiciary Committee on both sides of the aisle. Margaret Morrow will make a great judge. I think it is most unfortunate that she has to wait until February, but I feel that at least we have a commitment for a date certain that we will have a vote, and that will be before the February recess. 
Again, I thank very much the majority leader, Senator Lott, and the Democratic leader, Senator Daschle, for working with me to make sure that this happens. 
I think as we wind down, I have something to be very happy about, which is that we are going to have a vote on Margaret Morrow. I know when my colleagues see the strong bipartisan support she has in the State of California and in this U.S. Senate that she will win confirmation. 
Thank you very much, Mr. President. I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, although I discussed this bill last week, I think it is important as the Senate gets ready to vote on the conference report that my colleagues understand why the Senators from California and Texas oppose this conference report and why we believe it is a matter of extreme importance, not only to more than 2,000 California families, but also to taxpayers throughout the Nation and, indeed, to our national defense. 
Mr. President, although I discussed this bill last week, I want to take a few minutes of the Senate's time to explain why the Senators from California and Texas oppose this conference report and why we believe it is a matter of extreme importance--not only to more than 2,000 California families, but also to taxpayers throughout the Nation, and indeed, to our national defense. 
We oppose this bill because it contains provisions changing depot maintenance law that would harm our States and undermine the DOD's ability to perform maintenance work in the most cost-effective manner. These provisions were designed for one purpose: To destroy planned competitions at McClellan AFB in California and Kelly AFB in Texas and funnel workload to public depots in Oklahoma, Utah, and Georgia. 
To fully understand this complex issue, I want to provide the Senate with some background and recent historical context. 
McClellan Air Force Base in Sacramento and Kelly Air Force Base in San Antonio were scheduled for closure by the 1995 Base Realignment and Closure Commission. Rather than automatically relocate the duties performed at these bases to other Government depots, the Department of Defense chose to privatize some workload by conducting a public-private competition. 
Such privatization efforts were clearly authorized by the base closure commission's final report. Opponents of competition argue that the DOD's privatization initiatives thwart the intent of the BRAC, but this is simply not true. The report of the commission itself instructs the DOD to, and I am quoting the report, `consolidate the remaining workloads to other DOD depots or to private sector commercial activities.' It's right there: The DOD has the choice--either send the workload to other depots or to the private sector. 
This interpretation of the BRAC Commission's action was supported by the ranking member of the Armed Services Committee, Senator Levin, during debate last week. Although Senator Levin and I disagree somewhat on this issue, he said last week: 
I will state candidly that I disagreed with the assertion of the depot caucus that the Base Closure Commission prohibited privatization in place at Kelly and McClellan. The 1995 Base Closure Commission left it up to the Department of Defense to decide how to distribute the Kelly and McClellan work. 
I hope Senator Levin's statement will put to bed once and for all the false assertion that competition at McClellan contravenes the BRAC process. 
The DOD will not award workload to Kelly and McClellan automatically. Instead it has insisted that private bidders compete with public depots on the basis of quality and cost. In fact, the Department's first public-private competition for work at Kelly AFB was won by a public depot. After this result, how can anyone seriously argue that the process is biased in favor the private sector. 
The Depot Caucus--a coalition of legislators from States and congressional districts with public depots--have made no secret of their opposition to public-private competition at Kelly and McClellan. They believe that without competition, work currently performed at those bases will be directed to facilities in their States--regardless of cost or quality. That's not what is right for our Nation. 
In the House, Depot Caucus members were able to insert a provision into the DOD authorization bill that would have blocked privatization outright. The Senate bill initially included a similar provision, but it was removed prior to floor consideration. Thus, depot maintenance became a highly contentious issue for the DOD conference committee. 
The senators from Texas and California, as well as affected members of Congress, worked very hard to reach a compromise with the conferees on the DOD authorization bill. At first, we were pleased to learn the Depot Caucus abandoned its strategy of blocking competition outright, and instead submitted a proposal described as a compromise. 
This suggested compromise was supposed to allow competition to proceed, but would also guarantee a level playing field for both public and private bidders. When I first heard this description, I responded enthusiastically. Unfortunately, when I studied the alternative proposal, it became clear that it was simply a backdoor attempt to block competition. 
To explain the depot provision included in this bill, I have compared it to a footrace in which all the participants--both the private contractors and the public depots--are placed equally at the start line and told the first competitor across the finish line wins. Unfortunately, in this footrace, the private sector competitors are forced to run wearing 100-pound ankle weights. That's not a fair competition, Mr. President. 
But don't take my word for it. Listen to our leading opponent, the Senator from Oklahoma [Mr. Inhofe]. Following the announcement of the conference agreement, the Senator told his home State paper, the Daily Oklahoman, `I think it's highly unlikely any contractor would want to bid' on work at Kelly and McClellan, because of all the new requirements imposed by the bill. That article, titled `Senators Agree to Provision Giving Tinker Bidding Edge,' described in detail how the depot maintenance sections of this bill will give the Oklahoma Air Force depot an unfair bidding advantage. 
Mr. President, the Senators from California and Texas don't want an unfair advantage. We only want a level playing field and a fair chance to compete. Unfortunately, this bill denies fairness to thousands of working families. 
We remain willing to talk to the other side in an effort to reach a fair solution. During the conference, we were moving in the right direction and were close to an agreement. Frankly, we were very surprised when the bill was filed, closing the door to additional negotiations. We believed that a final was compromise in sight. However, once the conference report was filed, we had no choice but to use all of our procedural rights to block passage. 
From the beginning, the Clinton administration has made clear that any provision that effectively stops competition will jeopardize passage of the DOD authorization bill. OMB Director Frank Raines reiterated that view in a letter sent to the majority leader on last week. In the letter, Director Raines advises congressional leaders that the President's senior advisors would recommend that the President veto this bill. I hope the President will take that advice and I hope Senators will vote to sustain that veto if it comes. This bill is bad for California, bad for taxpayers throughout the Nation, and bad for our national defense. 
I want to mention another provision of this bill that I find objectionable--section 1211, which restricts the export of midrange computers. 
On July 10, the Senate overwhelmingly approved the Grams-Boxer amendment, which required a GAO study on the national security impact of the export of computers in the 2,000 to 7,000 MTOPS range to tier 3 countries. Our amendment was offered as an alternative to a proposal to require U.S. companies seeking to export computers in this range to go through a cumbersome and lengthy review and licensing process. The Secretary of Defense, the National Security Advisers, and the Secretary of Commerce all opposed the original proposal. 
Unfortunately, rather than accept the Grams-Boxer amendment, the conferees wrote a new provision imposing a number of procedural barriers to the export of midrange computers. 
Specifically, the bill requires that prospective exporters wait 10 days before shipping, during which a variety of Government agencies could object to the sale. This requirement is overly bureaucratic, and in the opinion of national security experts, is simply not necessary. 
The conference report allows the President to establish a new MTOPS threshold, but it requires a 6-month delay before the new threshold can take effect. I believe that the President deserves the flexibility to make the changes he deems appropriate. A 180-day notification to Congress makes it extremely unlikely that the high-performance computer control threshold will be increased fast enough to keep pace with this rapid technological changes that take place in this industry. 
This provision will hurt the American computer industry for no good reason. The conferees should have listened to the NSC, the Defense Department, and the Commerce Department and left this issue alone. 
Mr. President, I will vote against this conference report. We may have lost an important skirmish in the conference committee, but I believe the battle is not yet over. We will revisit these important issues in the near future. I remain willing to work with my colleagues to reach a compromise that will ensure fairness for the more than 2,000 California families who only want a fair chance to compete to keep their jobs. 
Mr. President, what it comes down to is this. When the last Base Closure Commission issued its report and decided to close down Kelly Air Force Base and McClellan Air Force Base, it was determined by the administration that it would be very foolish if we didn't utilize these bases to allow private firms to come in and do the depot work at these bases. We called it privatization in place. 
Specifically, in that BRAC, it was determined that privatization in place would be permitted at McClellan and Kelly, and that those private sector companies that came in would have an equal chance to bid on depot work. Let's face it, we know that around here. Everyone talks about, `Oh, yes, we want to be competitive'; `Oh, yes, let's bring in the private sector'; `Oh, yes, let's run the Government more like a business.' All that is fine except when something really happens and you get a chance to do it, you have the people from the States who will lose the work suddenly saying, `This is a bad idea.' 
There is language in this bill that is meant to destroy the competition that McClellan Air Force Base in California would offer and that Kelly Air Force Base in Texas would offer. They would take that work that could go to the private sector at an efficient rate, saving the taxpayers money, and instead funnel it to the public depots, the Government-owned, fully subsidized depots in Oklahoma, Utah, and Georgia. 
It is extraordinary to me that the very same people who were on this floor for those States arguing day in and day out for a little private sector competition around here are the ones who are undermining the chance to have privatization in place at Kelly and McClellan, thereby saving taxpayers millions of dollars and saving thousands and thousands of jobs. 
I think it is important to note that it is the position of the California Senators and the Texas Senators that we don't expect the work to be automatically given to McClellan and Kelly just because they are privatizing. The DOD will not award work load to Kelly and McClellan automatically. Instead, the DOD has insisted that private bidders compete with public depots on the basis of quality and cost, and that is as it should be. 
In fact, the first public-private competition for work at Kelly was won by a public depot. So I don't see how anyone could argue that the Senators from California and Texas are rigging the situation to assure work to our private companies at those bases. 
But what you have is the Depot Caucus, a coalition of legislators from States and districts with public depots, trying to completely destroy the ability of McClellan and Kelly to compete. They know that without competition, the work currently performed at Kelly and McClellan will be directed to their facilities regardless of cost and quality. Mr. President, that is not right for this Nation. 
What we had hoped in the conference was that we could reach some kind of agreement. Senator Levin worked very hard to try and reach some kind of agreement. 
We were very disappointed. We thought we had a compromise that was going to work, but, frankly, it became clear to us, as we read the so-called compromise, that it would not guarantee fairness. It would not guarantee a level playing field. 
If anyone has any doubt about it, they ought to look at what the Senator from Oklahoma said to his hometown press. He said in the Daily Oklahoman: `It is highly unlikely any contractor would want to bid' on the work at McClellan or Kelly. Even the headline of the paper said, `Senators Agree to Provision Giving Tinker Bidding Edge.' Of course, Tinker is a publicly owned depot. 
So what we have here is a Senator from one of the affected States saying on the one hand there is a fair compromise on this bill and then running home to his hometown press announcing with glee that, in fact, Kelly and McClellan would be out in the cold. That is really where it is at. 
So we have our colleagues who are saying on the one hand, yes, they want to be fair; on the other hand they are saying to Kelly 
and McClellan, you are at that starting point and now you can run with all of the public depots, and whoever wins, wins. What they don't tell you is that they put the equivalent of a 100-pound ankle weight on the people at Kelly and McClellan giving them a huge disadvantage. In fact, they are not going to be able to compete for the work. 
There are those who swear that under the current language in the bill, the Department of Defense will be able to award some work to McClellan and Kelly. We don't hear that from our private sector people. They are saying they probably would not be able to bid, which is exactly what the Senator from Oklahoma said when he ran home to his hometown press to tell the world that, in fact, the language in the bill was going to disadvantage the workers at Kelly and McClellan. 
I think it is important not only to listen to what Senators say on this floor but to read what they tell their hometown press, if you really want to know the truth. I think the Senator from Oklahoma made a big mistake by going home and telling everyone he had rigged the deal, but he did it, and now the truth is out. 
Mr. President, the Senators from California and Texas do not want an unfair advantage. We only want a level playing field and a fair chance to compete. Unfortunately, this bill denies fairness to the taxpayers, first and foremost, because that is what we are about--quality products at the best price. Competition will make that happen. No, we are denying them that. 
We remain willing to talk to the other side in an effort to reach a fair solution because, frankly, this bill could well be vetoed. This bill, the way it is currently written, goes back on a promise that was made to thousands of working families in Texas and California. 
I also want to discuss another part of this bill which is very objectionable, section 1211, which restricts the export of midrange computers. On July 10, the Senate overwhelmingly approved the Grams-Boxer amendment which required a GAO study on the national security impact of the export of computers in the 2,000 to 7,000 MTOPS range to tier 3 countries. 
Our amendment was offered as an alternative to a proposal that would require U.S. companies seeking to export computers in this range to go through a cumbersome and lengthy review and licensing process. The Secretary of Defense, the National Security Adviser and the Secretary of Commerce all supported the efforts of Senator Grams and myself on this matter. Unfortunately, when it got to the conference committee, rather than accept the Grams-Boxer amendment, the conferees wrote a whole new provision, a nightmare of procedural barriers to the export of midrange computers. 
Nobody wants to see computers be exported that are supercomputers, 
computers that in fact could give one country the ability to develop weapons of mass destruction. 
But these computers are in the midrange. Why would we restrict the export of computers that are made all over the world? We are putting our companies through a nightmare of bureaucratic procedures in order to export. I am really sad that the bill took this tack because it is behind the times and it does not reflect technology. 
We ought to wake up. This is almost the 21st century. The computers that are being stopped from export shortly will be the computers in every office in the country. So we are putting our computermakers through this for no reason at all. 
So, Mr. President, I will vote against this conference report. We lost an important skirmish in the committee, but I believe the battle is far from over. We will revisit these important issues in the near future if this bill is vetoed, which it is my understanding it will be. I hope that we can get together, all of us, on both sides of this issue, and resolve it. 
So I will vote against this bill because it is unfair. It is unfair to workers. It is unfair to taxpayers. And, finally, it has unnecessary controls on midrange computers that are so out of date, we are disadvantaging our computer companies for no good reason at all. 
Again, in closing, let me say, Mr. President, I look forward to sitting down with my colleagues in a new spirit of true compromise. There are ways we can resolve these problems. The Senator from Texas, Senator Hutchison, has been most dogged in her oversight of this. Senator Gramm of Texas, Senator Feinstein, and I, we want to find a fair solution. We are ready, willing and able to do that. I hope before the week is out, we will find a way to resolve this short of having a battle over a veto. 
Thank you very much, Mr. President. I yield whatever time I may still have to the Senator from Texas.  
Mr. GRAMM addressed the Chair.

Mrs. BOXER. As with many of our national parks, monuments, and other protected treasures, the character and beauty of the Point Reyes National Seashore are threatened--not by development or environmental degradation within the national seashore--but by proposed development outside the boundary line over which the Park Service has no control. 
The Point Reyes National Seashore Farmland Protection Act of 1997, which I am introducing today, is an innovative proposal which will ensure that the ecological integrity of the Point Reyes National Seashore is protected for future generations, while also preserving the property rights and historic agricultural use of the farmland in the area. 
The legislation establishes a Farmland Protection Area adjacent to the Point Reyes National Seashore within which willing farmers and ranchers will have the opportunity to sell conservation easements for their land. The Farmland Protection Area includes 38,000 acres of the eastern shore of Tomales Bay visible from within Point Reyes. Property owners within that area will be available, but not required, to sell conservation easements to their land. 
Conservation easements are legal agreements between a land-owner and a land trust, non-profit, conservation organization. The conservation easements restrict development on the land which is incompatible with the agricultural uses of the land. The easements would not expand public access, pesticide regulations, or hunting rights. Furthermore, the easements will remain with the land in perpetuity providing security for ranchers as well as continued protection for the national seashore. 
The easements will allow existing agricultural activities to continue and will preserve the pastoral nature of the land adjacent to Point Reyes National Seashore and the Golden Gate National Recreation Areas by guaranteeing no new development. 
This bill will not allow the Secretary to acquire land without the consent of the owner. 
I believe this legislation will become a model for land conservation across the Nation as Governments lack the funds to purchase fee title to protect valuable properties from development. This approach may be used to address similar problems at other parks, wildlife refuges, and marine sanctuaries by preserving compatible land use areas that protect view sheds and prevent environmental damage. 
This legislation will allow the National Park Service, working with the Marin Agricultural Land Trust [MALT], the Sonoma Land Trust [SLT], and the Sonoma County Agricultural Preservation and Open Space District [SCAPOSD] to protect this beautiful area at a fraction of the cost of acquiring title to the properties within the new boundaries. In addition, those properties would be maintained on Marin County's tax rolls. 
Without this legislation, almost 40,000 acres of scenic ranch land will be vulnerable to development. This bill has the strong support of the local farmers and ranchers within the area to be protected, local environmental groups including the Marin Conservation League, effected local governments and the local chamber of commerce. 
I commend Congresswoman Lynn Woolsey for her hard work and dedication to the House companion legislation. She has been working closely with interested parties in an effort to find this innovative approach to conservation which benefits ranchers, environmentalists, the county, and the Park Service alike. 
Last week, the House Resources Committee National Parks and Public Lands Subcommittee held a hearing on this legislation. In that hearing, concerns were raised over the Department of Interior's involvement in the conservation easements and the creation of a boundary around private agricultural lands. 
While I understand that the National Park Service is not usually involved in agricultural conservation easements I believe it is the most suitable agency in this case. The United States Department of Agriculture [USDA] does have a program whereby ranchers can sell conservation easements. These farmlands may not be critical agricultural lands at a national level, but they are critical to the Nation's investment in the Point Reyes National Seashore. A simple increase in funding for USDA's Farmland Protection Program would not ensure any new funding for the Farmland Protection Area. 
That also leads to the need for a boundary. While I believe it would be beneficial to authorize conservation easements for the entire agricultural area, we must first concentrate on the most critical lands. The boundary will ensure that the funding is used on these critical lands--lands closest to the national park which the Federal Government has the most interest in protecting. 
Currently, there are 18 operating ranches within the existing Point Reyes National Seashore. It is my understanding that these ranchers are pleased with their relationship with the National Park Service. All the landowners who wanted to continue ranching when the Point Reyes National Seashore was formed are still operating ranches. In fact, every single rancher has signed a statement affirming their satisfaction with the continuing cooperation and support they receive from the National Park Service as they continue their ranching operations. 
This legislation creates a completely voluntary program. Landowners who wish to sell their land to developers, continue to have that right. While I don't encourage such actions, this legislation does nothing to impede it. We have an opportunity here to take an important step toward protecting farmers and enhancing a national park. It is not often that we have such an occasion where often competing interests can co-exist. This legislation provides that opening. I encourage my colleagues to support this legislation and I am hopeful that we can pass it quickly.

Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I compliment my colleague, Senator Reed, for his very astute remarks. I thank the Senator from North Dakota for putting together what I think is a very excellent presentation. He has been carrying it through and I am proud to stand with him and the others who feel that we should not grant fast-track authority in this particular case. 
Madam President, as a student of economics, I learned that if you listen to an economics debate you will find that people generally fall into categories. 
When it comes to trade, I believe there are three categories. First, it is the free-trade-or-nothing category where you can't tell them anything about the evils that could come. They don't want to see the statistics about what happens to the downward pressure on wages. They don't want you to tell them even that there is any degradation to the environment. I call it the see-no-evil category. They don't want to know. 
Then there is another category which is the no-trade-no-matter-what category. I think those are the ones who don't want to hear any of the benefits that can come from trade. Maybe they are a little long run they say, or maybe we need to work more closely to make sure that the problems are resolved, but they don't want to hear that. That is the hear-no-evil category. 
Then there is this third category that I think a lot of my colleagues are in, and I certainly put myself in that category. And that third category is the fair-trade category, not the free-trade-at-any-cost category, not the no-trade-no-matter-what category, but the fair-trade category. 
I want you to know, Madam President, I have voted for fast-track authority several times. When it came to Canada, when it came to Israel, when it came to the GATT, I was there, because I felt when our administration, whoever it is, Republican or Democratic President, negotiates with countries who have similar standards of living, similar environmental laws, I don't fear downward pressure on wages, I don't fear downward standards for the environment, I don't fear downward standards on food safety, because when we are dealing with countries who care about what we pay, who have the same values in terms of worker rights and environmental rights, I feel comfortable giving fast-track authority to the President. 
I have to say that in this case, I feel very uncomfortable about giving this authority. I have been trying to find out what is the minimum wage or the wage paid for a manufacturing job in Indonesia, in Malaysia which are countries that, as members of APEC, may very well will be part of this authority. I have not been able to find out the minimum wage or the average wage for manufacturing jobs is in those countries. I am told that a statistical abstract put out by the Department of Labor does not contain the average hourly wage for manufacturing jobs in those countries. I am also told that the Department of Labor's statistical abstract does not contain the hourly manufacturing wage for Chile either. Rather, someone at CRS extrapolated from other available information to come up with an approximate hourly wage in Chile of $2.32. This compares to an approximate average hourly salary of $17.74 in the United States for manufacturing jobs. 
So here we have colleagues willing to hand over authority to make agreements with countries that we don't even know what they pay their workers, let alone what their environmental laws are. 
It seems to me there has to be a better way. I was listening to Senator Byrd's speech, and when he said, `Why are we here?' I think that is a reasonable question, because if you read article I, section 8 of the Constitution, it grants Congress the sole power to regulate trade and commerce with foreign nations and to make all laws which are necessary to carry out that power. 
Once in a while, we cede away our power. As I said, there have been times when I felt it was OK to do that. But in this case, when you don't even know who it is you are dealing with, what they pay their people, what their environmental laws are, it makes very little sense, and I think it puts our workers and our environment at great risk. The benefits of trade, under these circumstances, will certainly not outweigh the disadvantages. 
I represent the largest State in the Union, along with Senator Feinstein. I have watched the NAFTA. It was a close call for me on the NAFTA. I wound up saying no, because I believed the same problems existed then: the downward pressure on wages; the lack of environmental laws. 
I have to say that as you look at the different analyses as to whether NAFTA has worked--did it do better or not--as we have 
already heard today, we went from a trade surplus of about $5.4 billion with Mexico in 1992 to a trade deficit of more than $17 billion in 1996. 
Increased trade. Who benefited? Ask the California wine industry, I say to my friends. I represent the proudest wine industry maybe in the world. Those wines that are made in California are world renowned. Yet United States wine exports to Mexico have dropped by approximate one-third. United States wines face a 20 percent tariff in Mexico. 
However, coincident with NAFTA, Mexico gave Chilean wines a tariff reduction from 20 percent to 8 percent and guaranteed duty-free status within a year. But U.S. wines were subject to a 10 year phase-out of the 20 percent tariff. Ambassador Kantor, who I believe really wanted to make something good happen, promised to negotiate, within 120 days of NAFTA coming into force, a reduction of Mexican tariffs on United States wines--it did not happen. In fact, Mexican tariffs on United States wine and brandy are still at their pre-NAFTA levels, as a result of an unrelated dispute regarding corn brooms. 
So as my kids used to say when they were younger, it is time to take a time out. Take a deep breath, see where we are on the agreements we have already signed that haven't lived up to their promises. 
Sometimes when my colleagues--and I just heard one of them on the floor--talk about fast track, they get this energy. It is almost an out-of-control enthusiasm. I think sometimes when you go on a fast track, you go too fast. What is the rush? Why not allow this Congress to do our work? I didn't come here to exert downward pressure on workers' wages. I came here to make life better for the people of California. I didn't come here to see our environmental laws degraded, yet we have already seen examples of trade policy pressuring the United States to lower its environmental protections. Look at what recently happened with our dolphin protection laws. A trade deal with Mexico prevailed over our law and resulted in our law being weakened. In 1999, the definition of our beloved `dolphin safe' label could change because of trade pressures--not because we love dolphins any less. They just take a back seat. 
We saw shipments of poisoned berries come into our country. If we had enough inspectors there would probably be a better chance that these situations would not occur. Time out, folks, before we see that kind of situation expand. Sure, there will be more trade. But is that the kind of trade we want, where we have to recall berries because we don't have enough inspectors? 
I invite my colleagues to go down to the San Diego border. The border infrastructure is inadequate for the amount of trade. The new trade with Mexico as a result of NAFTA has placed severe stress on our southern border transportation infrastructure. According to the California State World Trade Commission, the result has been bottlenecks and traffic jams at border crossings, safety hazards, and declining environmental quality in the areas around the ports of entry. Why don't we do first things first? Why don't we bring these agreements to the Senate, to the House, let us debate and, to my colleague who says, `Well, every Senator wants to be President so it would be impossible because we are all so,' I assume he meant `egotists that we would write it our way,' I say I know a few Senators who don't want to be President. As a matter of fact, most of them don't. Most of them want to be Senators. 
I have seen this U.S. Senate work on chemical weapons treaties, all kinds of treaties that were difficult, and do you know what, Madam President? We did the job. That is what we are sent here to do, not to throw the ball over to the Executive and say, `It's yours, we don't care about wages, we don't care about the environment, we're just for trade at any cost.' I hope that we don't take that course. 
If you want to look at the jobs lost through NAFTA, the 
Department of Labor certified that there were 116,418 workers who notified them in April 1997 that they would lose their jobs as a result of NAFTA. There are estimates that go as high as 400,000 job losses. That is just job losses. What about the downward pressure? What about those who leave manufacturing jobs and have to go to service-sector jobs which pay less? That is the kind of disparity we see. 
I ask unanimous consent for 3 additional minutes.

Mrs. BOXER. I thank my colleague for the additional time. 
So when we look at the issue of trade, there are some who say the most important thing is the efficient flow of capital. Capital will flow to the low-wage countries, and that is the only thing we should be concerned about. 
But it seems to me in the United States of America, going into the next century, we have to value not only the flow of capital, which I believe ultimately will flow to the most efficient place, but we have to value the workers, we have to value the environment and we have to value our quality of life.

Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, you will find a huge number opposing this fast-track legislation. The National Wildlife Federation basically says that they are against it for one reason. They have no assurances that the Environmental Protection Agency of America will be active participants in the trade negotiations. There are many other organizations which I don't have the time to name at this point. 
We have to make a choice. We have to decide, if we value our workers as much as we value the free flow of capital, we have to ask ourselves, do we value clean air and clean water as much as we value the free flow of capital? 
We have to say, do we value our safe food supply as much as we value the free flow of capital? And do we feel that it is important to have an adequate infrastructure in place of inspectors at the border to make sure the food supply is safe, to make sure that our products are being treated fairly? And should we even care about a positive trade balance? Sure, you open up the doors, but what has happened to us, as my colleagues brilliantly pointed out, is the balance of trade has flipped, and where we used to be predominant and we sent more exports than we took in imports, we see a reverse. We now have negative numbers. 
So I believe, again, in summing up, that we do have three choices: Free trade at any cost; see no evil; don't tell me about the problems; no trade at any cost; don't tell me about the good parts of trade; and the middle course that my colleagues are taking, which is fair trade. Yes, trade is crucial, it is important. We are part of one world, but we in the U.S. Senate who care about values and American jobs and an American environment, who care about clean and safe food, who want food safety laws in place, also want to have an opportunity to alter or amend trade agreements as we deem appropriate and necessary. 
Thank you very much.

 Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, on June 5, 1997, a remarkable woman and superb scientist, Dr. Helene Smith, died at her home in California. 
Dr. Smith's scholarly activities and indefatigable personality influenced the scientific community well beyond San Francisco's California Pacific Medical Center, where she directed the Geraldine Brush Cancer Research Institute. 
There is great sadness as well as irony associated with Dr. Smith's death from breast cancer, a disease she devoted much of her life to studying. 
Her friend and colleague, Dr. Ann Thor, professor of pathology and surgery at the Northwestern University School of Medicine, has written a very moving tribute which will be published in the Journal of Mammary Gland Biology and Neoplasia (Volume 3, Issue 1, in press).

Mrs. BOXER. I thank the Chair. I thank Senator Gramm for yielding me this time. I thank Senator Hutchison for her being so kind to me to allow me to precede her in these remarks. I will not go over my 5 minutes because I know she has much to offer and has been struggling with this issue for quite a while. 
I wonder if the public is confused about what this debate is all about. They see colleagues across party aisles, from Texas and California, joining hands--we don't often do this on many issues--and complaining that, in fact, a compromise that was supposed to occur in the committee to work out the problems we all had with this depot language was abandoned. Had that language been held to, had we been able to work it out, we would all be here without holding up this bill. 
I really think what is at stake is very important not just to those workers at McClellan, 2,000 strong--it impacts 2,000 families--4,000 workers at Kelly, at least that many and their families, but also, as Senator Gramm has pointed out, to taxpayers throughout the Nation. 
But the fact is, either you are for competition and the best deal for taxpayers or you are not. We are for competition. We are for allowing the private sector to come in with a fair and level playing field. The language in the bill which we now oppose would thwart competition. 
In the Senate, we managed to keep all harmful language off the bill, but the House had very restrictive language. We hoped going into the conference there could be a compromise. 
What you are going to hear from some of the folks who don't want competition from the private sector is that this group of us from Texas and California want to undo the BRAC, want to undo the Base Closure Commission and their recommendations vis-a-vis Kelly and McClellan. This is false. 
If you turn to page I-85 of the BRAC report, you will find that right there it says the DOD is instructed to `consolidate the remaining workloads to other DOD depots or to private sector commercial activities.' 
So very clearly the BRAC said the DOD should have the flexibility to work with the private sector, and the administration very much wants to do this. The Department of Defense very much wants to do this. 
We already heard from Senator Gramm that the President will veto this bill if we do not move forward toward a compromise. I don't think the Senators from California and Texas want a veto. We could stop talking at this very moment and go into one of the cloakrooms and work this matter out. We think we almost did work this matter out, but overnight, something changed in the language. We are unable to look our constituents in the eye and look the taxpayers in the eye and say they are going to get a fair deal, because they are not. 
That is really all we want on behalf of our constituency: a fair chance to compete, to do the work at a lower cost. You wouldn't think we would have to struggle over such a commonsense proposition. 
I really have to say that the passage of this bill has been jeopardized. The adoption of this conference report is jeopardized, and there is no reason for it. We were so close. We ought to go back again. 
What happened in the end, to use an analogy, was like a footrace in which the committee basically said, `Line up all the private sector people who want to be involved in depot work; line up all the public depots in Utah, in Oklahoma, in Georgia, and everyone will sprint as fast as they can for 100 yards. The first person to cross the finish line wins.' 
Unfortunately, the committee put 100-pound weights on those from Kelly and McClellan, so they can't win a race or even compete in a race if they are so burdened. That is what this conference committee has done. 
I say in the name of fairness, to those working families at Kelly and McClellan, I say in the name of fairness to taxpayers who want to see us move forward and save as many tax dollars as we can, and in the name of a strong national defense where the Defense Department has the flexibility it needs in this case and many others to move to the best way to meet our national defense needs, in the name of all of them, I suggest that we go back to compromise mode. We can resolve this problem and move this bill forward. 
That is the spirit in which I speak to the U.S. Senate today. I do want to say this. I am as determined as my colleagues from Texas and my senior Senator, Senator Feinstein, to do everything in my power to make sure--to make sure--that the commitments made to the people at Kelly and McClellan and to the taxpayers are, in fact, kept. We will use every parliamentary tool at our disposal to make sure that fairness and justice will win out in this debate. Thank you, very much. I yield back my time to Senator Gramm.

Mrs. BOXER. Thank you. 
Mr. President, I am pleased to add my voice to support the nomination of William Kennard to be the Chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, and I am proud to say that he is a native of my home State of California. I join with Senator Feinstein today in this moment of pride. 
Bill Kennard's experience and knowledge of communications issues will be extremely important in helping the FCC deal with the many, many difficult challenges it faces. He has been their general counsel since 1993 serving as the principal legal adviser of the agency during an extraordinary period in the history of communications. 
The last 4 years have seen dramatic changes in communications technology, communications markets, and communications policy. We know one important thing is for certain. There will be more historic changes almost every month and every week in this area. 
In a series of historic decisions, the FCC has rewritten the rules governing every lane of the information superhighway--local, long distance, international telecommunications, satellite, spectrum, broadcast television, and multichannel TV. 
Bill Kennard has a bird's-eye view of these important changes, providing excellent advice and counsel to the FCC Chairman and Commissioners. 
Prior to joining the FCC, Bill Kennard practiced communications law for several years where he specialized in broadcast, cable TV, and cellular matters. He knows where the communications world has been. And he has a strong vision for the future of the communications world. 
I urge the Senate to give unanimous approval to this very important nomination. 
I yield my time to the Senator from South Carolina.

 Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise today to express my outrage and disgust at recent comments by Dr. Mahathir Mohamad, the Prime Minister of Malaysia. According to reports by official Malaysian news agencies, the Associated Press, and Reuters, Dr. Mahathir speculated last week that the collapse of Malaysian currency and the subsequent turmoil in its stock market may have been the result of an international Jewish conspiracy to oppress his predominately Muslim nation. 
Malaysia is in the midst of an economic crisis. Its currency, the Ringgit, has depreciated over 25 percent, which has sent its stock market to all-time lows. The Prime Minister has blamed the crisis on currency speculators, most notably the famous hedge fund manager George Soros, who is Jewish. Soros has denied trading extensively in the Ringgit and most financial analysts agree that currency traders could not have triggered the Ringgit crisis. 
I do not want to mischaracterize Dr. Mahathir's remarks, so I will quote them directly, as reported by the Associated Press. According to the AP, Dr. Mahathir said, `The Jews robbed the Palestinians of everything, but in Malaysia they could not do so, hence they do this, depress the Ringgit.' 
Referring to the economic progress made by Malaysia over the past decade, Dr. Mahathir said, `Incidentally, we are Muslims, and the Jews are not happy to see the Muslims progress.' Finally, he speculated about a global anti-Malaysian conspiracy saying, `We may suspect that they [Jews] have an agenda, but we do not want to accuse.' 
Mr. President, I was shocked by these comments. They are patently outrageous, hateful, and blatantly anti-Semitic. I thought it appropriate that the Simon Wiesenthal Center, which is based in Los Angeles, immediately demanded a clarification from the Malaysian Government. 
Today, the Simon Wiesenthal Center shared with me a letter it received from Hashim Makaruddin, Press Secretary to the Prime Minister. Rather than clarify Dr. Mahathir's remarks, Mr. Makaruddin's letter confirms a hostile attitude among Malaysia's leaders. 
Mr. Makaruddin denies that the Prime Minister specifically alleged a Jewish conspiracy to stifle Malaysia's economic growth. He writes that Dr. Mahathir `was merely explaining that the currency crisis now being faced by Malaysia was the doing of George Soros, who is a Jew, and that among the victims which suffered were Malaysia and Indonesia, which are Muslim countries. Because coincidentally Mr. Soros is a Jew and Malaysia and Indonesia are Muslim countries, there are people who thought that this currency manipulation was a Jewish `conspiracy' against the Muslim countries. This was what Dr. Mahathir told the crowd at the rally.' 
Mr. President, in other words, the Prime Minister's explanation is that he was not advancing his own anti-Semitic views, he was simply repeating the anti-Semitic conspiracy theories advanced by others without refuting them. Clearly, it is wrong for any government leader to lend official credence to such anti-Semitic views by repeating them at a widely attended rally. 
I find Mr. Makaruddin's explanation of the Prime Minister's remarks wholly unsatisfactory. 
I call on Prime Minister Mahathir to apologize to those who have taken offense at his remarks. I do not believe any other course of action can undo the damage done by these hateful and irresponsible comments.

 Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise today to honor and congratulate Carmen Warschaw on receiving the 1997 Heart of Gold Award from the Medallion Group of the Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. 
Through the years, Ms. Warschaw has shown her commitment to the people of Los Angeles, and to the people of California. She has served her community with pride and dignity. I commend her on a job well done, and an honor richly deserved. 
Ms. Warschaw has served on many governing boards and commissions, including the California Fair Employment Practices Commission, the National Council of Women, the California State Board of Social Welfare, the Los Angeles County Election Security Commission, and the 1996-97 Los Angeles County Blue Ribbon Budget Task Force. She is currently an active member of the State Central Commission of California. 
Ms. Warschaw has also served as a delegate to the Democratic National Convention, chairperson of the Jewish Community Relations Committee, and National Vice Chairperson of the Anti-Defamation League. She has a long tradition of supporting the arts: She was president of the Los Angeles County Art Museum, a founder of the Civic Light Opera, and a board member of the Truman Library Institute. In 1968, she was a recipient of the prestigious Los Angeles Times Woman of the Year Award. 
In addition to these accomplishments and activities, Ms. Warschaw is a mother of two and a grandmother of three. 
There are many heroes among us: Men and women who, like Ms. Warschaw, give something back to the world in which they live. They inspire and move us. We may not always know their names, nor recognize their faces, but their goodwill lives on in every life they touch. Their selflessness and courage is an example to us all. 
I congratulate Carmen Warschaw once again, for her years of dedication and hard work on behalf of her city, her State, and her country. She is a true hero, and I salute her.

 Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, on October 13, the United States and more than 150 nations will mark the observance of World Food Day. Every year since 1980, World Food Day has been a time to raise awareness of worldwide hunger, and recognize those who have dedicated their lives to help people in need. 
Many of the individuals who are fighting the war against hunger do so through the World Food Program [WFP]. The WFP is the largest international food aid organization in the world. Last year, 45 million people in 84 countries benefited from the 2.2 million tons of food distributed by the WFP. 
The southern part of Sudan is an example of a region where the WFP helps alleviate the suffering and illnesses caused by hunger. The situation in the Sudan is extremely desperate and countless children have died due to starvation. 
One person who deserves special mention is Charisse Tillman of Culver City, CA. She is an assessment coordinator for the WFP in Sudan. When a village or a community is targeted by the WFP for assistance, Ms. Tillman is one of the first to arrive on the scene. She determines how much food is needed by the community and much it can actually produce. This is extremely important so that WFP does not in any way discourage local agricultural production. 
The World Food Program is home to many dedicated people like Charisse Tillman. I hope my colleagues will join me in honoring her and all the unselfish humanitarians at the WFP.

Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, having recommended Anthony W. Ishii to President Clinton to be U.S. District Judge for the Eastern District in California, I am gratified to see his nomination come before the full Senate today, and I urge my colleagues to vote to confirm him. 
Anthony Ishii, a third generation Californian, will be the first Asian-American to serve on the Eastern District federal bench. He has had a long and distinguished legal career. Currently, he serves as a Municipal Court Judge for the Central Valley Municipal Court in Fresno, California. 
For ten years prior to his service on the Municipal Court bench, he served as a Justice Court Judge for the Parlier-Selma Judicial District in Fresno County. He was initially appointed to the Justice Court position by the Fresno County Board of Supervisors, and has since stood for election three time. He won his first reelection and has been unopposed in each of the two subsequent ones. 
Judge Ishii received his Juris Doctor from Boalt Hall, the law school at the University of California, Berkeley. Early in his career, he was a Deputy City Attorney in Sacramento and a Deputy Public Defender for the County of Fresno. Prior to his service on the bench, he was an attorney in private practice. He has extensive trial experience, handling over 70 jury trials before becoming a judge. 
For years, Judge Ishii has been involved in numerous professional activities. He was appointed to the prestigious California Judicial Council by California Supreme Court Chief Justice Malcolm Lucas. Additionally, he served as a member of the Judicial Council Advisory Committee on the Administration of Justice in the rural counties for three years. He served from 1991 to 1993 on the Commission on the Future of the California Courts. From 1983 to 1993, he was a member of the Fresno County Justice Court Judges Association and served a term as president of the organization. 
Judge Ishii is also a leader in his community. He is a member of the Japanese American Citizens League, where he has served in numerous capacities for over nineteen years. His community service includes the Selma Public Education Foundation, the Selma Hospital Foundation, the Selma Delinquency Prevention Committee, and service on the Board of Valley Public Television. He has been a member of the California Small Business Development Board, the California Task Force on Rural Economy, and the Asian and Pacific Islander Advisory Committee. 
Judge Ishii has received numerous letters illustrating his broad, bipartisan support. The Sheriff of Fresno County, Steve Magarian, who has known Judge Ishii for 15 years, says he `has earned the deep respect from law enforcement'. 
The Chief of Police, William Eldridge, of the Livingston Police Department says Judge Ishii is `highly respected by both the citizens of the community and law enforcement.' 
The President of the Merced County Sheriff's Employee Association, Brian Miller, writes Ishii `has a strong commitment to law enforcement, and has the background and knowledge that makes him an invaluable asset to the Federal Judicial System.' 
The President of the 700-member Fresno Police Officers Association, Larry Bertao, says that Judge Ishii has an `outstanding reputation among local law enforcement . . . and will serve his community in an effective and distinguished manner as a federal court judge.' 
The President of the Fresno Deputy Sheriffs Association, Victor Wisemer, says Judge Ishii is `well-respected by his colleagues, has a strong commitment to quality law enforcement, and is equitable in the decisions he renders.' 
Judge Ishii has the unanimous support of the Fresno County Board of Supervisors, an all-Republican Board. Their letter states that Ishii is `recognized for his exemplary judicial tenure and has universal community support.' 
The President of the Fresno Chamber of Commerce, Doug Davidian, says he is `well respected by law enforcement, the judiciary and by the legal and business communities.' 
I strongly believe Judge Ishii will make an outstanding addition to the federal bench. I believe his intelligence, judicial temperament, broad experience, professional and community service, and deep commitment to justice qualify him to serve on the federal bench with great distinction. 
I am very proud to have had the opportunity to recommend Anthony Ishii for the Federal District Court, and I urge my colleagues to vote to approve his nomination.

Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I would like to mention one issue of concern in the conference report on appropriations for the Environmental Protection Agency. It is in regard to report language on the Particulate Matter Research Program. 
I agree that we need more research on the sources and the health effects of particulate matter and strongly support this bill's appropriation of funds for new research. However, I would like to make it clear, for the record, that I do not agree with the conference report language that says that `we do not yet have available sufficient facts necessary to proceed with future regulations for a new particulate matter standard.' 
The EPA standards are based on the best available science regarding the health effects of exposure to particulate matter. Some argue that we should not proceed until we have scientific proof of the exact relationship between exposures to particulate matter, and health effects. 
If we applied that principle in the late 1970's, we would not be enjoying the benefits of our current standards which have led to, for example, air pollution from carbon monoxide being reduced by 28 percent, from sulphur dioxide 41 percent, and from lead 98 percent.

Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I was listening to the news this morning, and the reporter said, `The Senate has agreed to set aside campaign finance reform and go to more pressing matters.' 
I thought to myself, campaign finance reform is a pressing matter. 
It seems to me there can be no more pressing matter. We ought to deal with this issue of campaign finance reform and let the chips fall. 
We have a lot of parliamentary games being played. One of my colleagues, Senator Dorgan, said earlier that if the American public was listening this morning and heard somebody say, `There is a poison pill on a tree that has been filled,' the public would not really understand what we were talking about. When we talk about a poison pill, we are talking about an objectionable amendment that is extraneous to what we are trying to do being offered in an attempt to kill the underlying bill. Filling the tree means using a parliamentary tactic to prevent opponents of an amendment from offering any changes to that amendment. So I apologize to the American public if they tuned in and heard somebody talking about a tree being filled with poison pills because it does get confusing. 
But the matter is not that confusing. The matter is, how do we finance our campaigns, and can we improve that system? I think all of America is crying out, `Yes, we can improve it.' Only a few say, `Don't touch it, it is great, and money is speech.' 
Now, it is true that a divided Supreme Court did equate spending as much money as you have with the right of free speech. But that was a close call. It seems to me our Founders would be turning in their graves if they believed at the time they stood up for free speech that it really meant `only if you are rich,' because, folks, that is what it is about. 
I am proud of my colleagues, Russ Feingold and John McCain, for pressing this matter across party lines, and standing up for campaign finance reform. I am proud of both of them because it is not easy. The status quo around here is what people like the best. 
I have to tell you, when I think about speech, I think about both sides of it. If you have an independently wealthy billionaire running against you in a State like California, and he writes checks every day and bashes you on television every day and bashes the other opponents that he is running against every day, I believe we should ask, what about the free speech rights of the opponents? What about the speech of the other people that are drowned out because of money? If you equate money and speech, it seems to me you are saying someone who is wealthy has more speech rights than someone who is not. 
This is not the American way. We are all created equal. That is the basis of who we are as a nation. I really hope that we can get past this notion that money is speech and that we will move forward with a comprehensive bill. 
My one disappointment with the substitute pending before the Senate, is that it is not as comprehensive as the first version of the McCain-Feingold bill. However, I respect the judgement of the Senators that it would be best at this time to zero in on two horrible abuses of the system. 
One abuse is the soft money abuse, which means unregulated dollars of any amount that flow into political parties. We have seen the hearings that are going on by this U.S. Senate and over in the House. If anything, we come away with this: Let's put an end to soft money. We could point fingers all day--this politician, that politician, where the calls were made, who made them--but I guarantee that gets us nowhere. The issue is the system. There will be enough examples around from both parties. This is not the problem. 
So if we get exercised about these hearings--and I have seen colleagues here who are very exercised about them--they should go over to John McCain and Russ Feingold and tell them they are on their side. There ought to be some controls on the soft money contribution, and those controls are now pending before the Senate. The second area of abuse tackled by the McCain-Feingold bill is the so-called issues advocacy advertisements. This is where you take an organization with endless sums of money to put into an attack ad against the candidate they don't like. 
Under current law, individuals can only give $1,000 in the 
primary and $1,000 in the general to the candidate, but issues advocacy has grown into huge loophole. These so-called issues ads are not regulated at all and mention candidates by name. They directly attack candidates without any accountability. It is brutal. I have seen them. I have seen them from both sides. 
I can tell you, it is totally unfair and totally unregulated and vicious. It is vicious. We have an opportunity in the McCain-Feingold bill to stop that and basically say, if you want to talk about an issue, that is fine, but you can't mention a candidate. If this is truly issue advocacy, you can't mention a candidate a few weeks before the election. 
If you want to talk about an issue day and night, talk about the issue, whether it is choice, the environment, health care, gun control--talk about it. But once you attack a candidate, that is not an issue ad. This is what the Feingold-McCain will go after. 
I think we owe a great big thank you to those two colleagues for pushing this and moving this. I have to say that I am very disappointed at some of the debate, because one of our colleagues who is leading the charge against this says, `We are going to kill this bill and we're going to be proud to kill this bill.' 
I don't know why someone would feel proud to kill a reform bill that the American people want to see us do. I don't think it is a proud moment. I don't think it will be a proud moment if we can't move this forward. 
I am both hopeful and fearful at this point. Hopeful because, as long as we are here in this body and this measure is pending and the people are listening, there will be an outcry for reform; but I am fearful because of some of the statements I have heard. 
Let me close by saying what it is like to run in a State like California. I am told by the people with the calculators that if you figure out how much a candidate from California needs to raise in 6 years to run for the U.S. Senate, you would have to raise $10,000 every day, 7 days a week, in order to meet your budget. That is not right. That is not the way I think the American people want us to spend our time. I also don't think the American people want to make this an exclusive club for multimillionaires. 
If we get to that stage where everyone here is independently wealthy and they really don't understand what life is all about, I think we will lose a very special aspect of what a representative democracy is. 
I am hopeful we will rise to the occasion. We have done it before in this body. We have a chance to do it again. I see the Senator from Minnesota is on his feet, and I yield the floor.

Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I say to my friend from Massachusetts, thank you for leading this side. 
Mr. President, this amendment--and this is the reason why we are voting against cloture--this amendment would use $7 million of public taxpayer funding to pay tuition at private schools. We are in battle to balance the budget. I am proud to say we are making great progress. But I know that Americans agree that education is a priority and, while we cannot give every child a scholarship, while we cannot do everything we want to do, while we cannot fund, as we would like, Senator Carol Moseley-Braun's incredible initiative as we rebuild our crumbling schools--while we cannot do that, here we are diverting $7 million of taxpayer funds and giving them to private schools. 
Who are we helping in the District of Columbia? Who, under this idea, do we contend would be helped? Mr. President, 2,000 out of 78,000 children; 3 percent. It is the 3 percent solution when we need a 100 percent solution. You know, you could really debate whether 3 percent of the kids would be helped. Because I have read this proposal, and I have to tell you, if I were for vouchers I would have written it a little differently. Why do I say that? This allows schools to spring up, mom-and-pop-shop schools, untested, if they can show that they can draw 25 children. Untested schools will spring up to grab this new source of funding from Uncle Sam. Because, as we know, the good schools that are touted around here, No. 1, many of them are filled up; No. 2, most of them charge at least twice the tuition that these children will get. So we are, in essence, going to start a whole new cottage industry of people popping up with `new schools,' to grab this taxpayer money. To supposedly help 3 percent of the kids. I contend 3 percent of the kids will not be helped by going to some of those operations. 
So, I hope my colleagues will read this proposal because, if you read it, you learn a lot of interesting things. For example, a new board of directors is set up. This is a bureaucracy, folks --a new bureaucracy. The board of directors are going to be political appointees, political appointees. So here we have a lot of talk about, `get government out of our lives,' and who is going to decide this? Political appointees: The Speaker of the House, Newt Gingrich, is going to recommend these appointees to the President. Guess what, buried in that bill, the people who sit on these boards can earn up to $5,000 a year in a stipend. That $5,000 is more than the tuition check for the child. So we are creating a little cushy new bureaucracy here, with political appointees, to help 3 percent of the kids, which I contend would not be helped. 
So, I feel Members ought to look at this. My State, California, has rejected vouchers twice. Let me tell you the reason. The reason is they want to help 100 percent of the kids. They are smart. They know the answer lies in better schools. That's why we backed charter schools, that's why we want national standards, to make sure that our children are living up to their potential. So these are the things that we want to do in California. 
Mr. President, we could take this $7 million and we could do a lot of repairs on some of these D.C. schools. Some of them need boilers, because it is freezing in those schools. We could set up an after-school program. That is so important. We are doing it in Los Angles and Sacramento, so these kids have something to say `Yes' to after school. We could set up many of those after-school programs with this $7 million. By the way, just take the half-million off the top you are going to use for this new bureaucracy, you could fix a lot of schools. You could put after-school programs in. You could mentor a lot of children. 
So I want quality schools for every child in America. I think this is a surrender. This is a surrender. And even with it, if it went into place, in my view it would encourage these new little schools to pop up, untested, because somebody would get the idea: Oh, this is great. I can get $3,500 per child. I will just set up my own school. And convince this board of directors that is politically appointed that they ought to be allowed to continue. 
I hope we are going to reject this. I do not doubt for one moment that the people who put this forward are very sincere and caring about children. I just think it will have unintended consequences. I hope we will vote this down. 
I thank my colleague from Massachusetts and I yield the remainder of my time to him.

Restructure the whole school; foster world-class instruction; extend the school day; enhance family centered learning. 
I talked about after school. Senator Carol Moseley-Braun talks about fixing the crumbling schools. This is what we ought to be doing, not surrendering and giving these dollars to private institutions, some of them that are going to be totally untested, I say to my friend.

It is interesting, some of the people who are the strongest supporters of giving back to these private schools are fighting against testing. They don't want to have the children tested. Therefore, we will never know who is being left behind. The Senator is on target. We know what we have to do to make these kids whole. We know what we have to do to help 100 percent of the kids.

 Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I take the floor today to speak about the nomination of Bill Lann Lee to be Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights at the Department of Justice. I urge the Judiciary Committee to act expeditiously on this nomination and send it to the full Senate for a vote. 
Bill Lann Lee brings outstanding legal, educational and personal credentials to this important position. Most recently, he served as the western regional counsel for the NAACP Legal Defense and Education Fund. Mr. Lee is also regarded by many as a skilled consensus-builder with a knack for finding pragmatic solutions, earning him praise from allies and adversaries alike. His numerous accomplishments in litigation and over 20 years of experience in civil rights work have established him as one of the most experienced civil rights lawyers in the Nation. 
Bill Lee was inspired to become a civil rights lawyer by his father, who was subjected to discrimination in housing and other areas because of his race, even after serving his country loyally in the U.S. Army during World War II. Witnessing this bigotry had a profound impact on young Bill. After graduating from Columbia Law School in 1974, he entered the legal profession with a passion for serving the public interest and advocating for civil rights. 
Bill Lee will bring a passion and commitment to the cause of civil rights and equal treatment under law for all Americans. He is a tremendous role model for all Americans who care about civil rights. Early in life, he recognized the importance of public service and he has dedicated his life to it. 
On that point, I would like to take this opportunity to express my concern that many Americans, especially those with Asian names or of Asian heritage, may be less interested in becoming involved in public life as a result of a series of unfortunate and disparaging remarks made by some in the media and in public positions. 
Such remarks and misperceptions appeal to the worst human instincts when we should be appealing to the best. A recent study by the National Asian Pacific American Legal Consortium documented an increase last year in hate crimes targeting Asian Pacific Americans. 
This disturbing trend demonstrates that now is the time for these issues to be handled fairly, thoroughly and expediently, under strong new leadership by the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division.

Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I would first like to thank the chairman of the Housing Opportunity and Community Development Subcommittee for joining me in this colloquy regarding a very serious problem for many low-income citizens living in mobile home parks. These good people, most of whom are senior citizens, are not able to use section 8 assistance because their park owners refuse to accept it. 
In the vast majority of cases, mobile home tenants own their mobile home and rent the space on which the home sits. Unfortunately, many residents become unable to pay the rising space rates and require low-income housing assistance under section 8. This is especially common among elderly residents whose income drops following death of a spouse or illness. 
Under the current system, because section 8 assistance payments are made to landlords, section 8 participation requires that the landlord sign a rental assistance contract with the appropriate housing authority. For various reasons, many mobile home park owners are refusing to sign these contracts. Consequently, their residents are being denied the section 8 assistance they need to meet their housing costs. 
Without section 8 assistance, these very low-income, primarily elderly, residents, have few options. Some will be forced to move their homes to parks which accept section 8 assistance. However, this is an expensive and laborious process. It costs a minimum of $10,000 to relocate a mobile home, money that most low-income tenants do not have. 
Some residents will not even have the option of moving their mobile homes to parks which accept section 8 payments. In areas with a shortage of spaces, tenants will have to either abandon their homes or continue to pay unaffordable space rents. Because currently high-space rents reduce the demand for mobile homes, those who must abandon their homes will likely not recoup their investment, often losing their entire lifesavings. 
This is a critical problem for many in my State of California. Mobile homes are one of the few sources of affordable housing in many areas of the State, especially for senior citizens. There are approximately 700,000 mobile home residents in California 50-60 percent of whom are seniors. Without section 8 assistance, many of these residents will lose their homes and lifetime investments.

Mrs. BOXER. I appreciate the chairman's response. I would like to offer a solution. The House-passed Public Housing bill, H.R. 2, contains a provision that allows section 8 payments to go directly to mobile home tenants of parks which refuse to enter into section 8 contracts. This provision, section 330, gives the money directly to the tenants thereby obviating the need for a contract between the park owner and the local housing authority. Because the House provision only applies to tenants who already live in parks that do not accept section 8, it does not force park owners to take in new tenants with section 8 assistance. 
I hope, Mr. Chairman, that when we get to conference on the Public Housing bills, we can seriously consider section 330 of the House-passed bill as a possible solution to the very urgent problem facing so many mobile home tenants.

Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, this is a very important debate. Yesterday when we opened debate on the D.C. appropriations, I urged colleagues on both sides not to come forward with controversial amendments because I feel, particularly in light of the situation in the District of Columbia, we need to move on with this bill. But such is not the case and every Senator has every right to bring an issue to the floor at any time, and that is what has happened here. We do have a long, extensive debate on the issue of vouchers. 
Mr. President, as I said yesterday, I don't think this is about anything but our children. I don't think it is about strong voices. I don't think it is about quiet voices. 
I don't think it is about passionate voices. I think it is about our children. How can we help our children? I think there is complete agreement that one way to help our children is to make sure they have the best education in the world. I don't think that is the question. So what I think it is about is not about us, it is about the children. It is about how we help them get the best education possible. As someone who believes in a free public education, as someone who attended public schools all the way from kindergarten to college, and as someone who sent my children to public schools, and as someone who represents a State that has rejected private school vouchers with taxpayer funds twice overwhelmingly, I think I stand here with some credibility on the subject. 
It really amazes me, in a year when the District of Columbia students started their school year late because many of their school buildings were not safe, that we are voting on amendments that essentially gives money to private schools. What I said yesterday when I alluded to this amendment is that it would be very hard for many of us to support an amendment that helps 3 percent of the students--or purports to help 3 percent of the students, while leaving 97 percent without any additional help. 
I want to make the point with a chart that I am going to just leave up here. I think that what we need is a 100-percent solution, which is quality public schools for all the children. That is what we need. As I go around my State, I have an `Excellence in Education' award that I give out to parents, to teachers, to principals, to business leaders, who are all helping get to quality public schools for all. Yes, we have problem public schools in our State. We also have some great public schools in our State. I think what we need to do, rather than give money to the private schools when we know we don't have extra funding, is to ensure that we taxpayers don't divert the money into private schools, but instead, make sure that it is diverted where it belongs, to all the children. So we are faced here with private school vouchers for a few--for 3 percent, a couple thousand of the kids in the District of Columbia while there are 78,000 who absolutely are going to lose by this. And so I hope people will support the 100 percent solution that many of us are supporting, rather than a 3-percent solution. 
Now, what do I mean by a 100-percent solution? I mean that we should do things that help all of our children. What are some of those things? We know that our colleague, Senator Carol Moseley-Braun, has pointed out that many of our schools are crumbling, that there are serious problems with them. It certainly was brought home not only here in the District of Columbia, but in other parts of the country, as other schools also opened late because they were dealing with these repairs. So here we go, some want to give $7 million--$7 million--to private schools. By the way, allowing a lot off the top for administration--and I will get into that--and that whole new bureaucracy that is set up in this amendment is extraordinary. I am going to read you the amendment, about the bureaucracy it sets up. The schools need help in terms of the facilities. We could have mentoring programs for these children, academic assistance, bringing in the business community, recreational activities, technology training. As the President has said, every child should know how to log onto a computer in our schools. 
There are other viable school activities, drug, alcohol and gang prevention, health and nutrition counseling, and job skills preparation. Mr. President, if you look at the rate of crime committed by juveniles, it would amaze you to see the spike-up between the hours of 3 and 6 p.m. It seems to me that since we do have a great desire here to help the kids of the District of Columbia, we ought to be helping all of them from a menu of things that we could do for the $7 million that, if this amendment passes, will be diverted away from all the children. 
Now, I want to point out that, under this amendment, the District of Columbia would be used as a guinea pig. It is a scheme that many States have rejected. 
I talked about my own State of California. Recent voucher proposals in Washington State and Colorado and California have lost by over 2-to-1 margins. A recent Gallup poll said that 71 percent of Americans believe the focus of improvement efforts should be on reforming the existing public school system rather than on finding an alternative system. Congress should not enact what the American people reject. 
Funds should not go to private schools when the District of Columbia has such stark needs. Their needs are $2.1 billion to repair the schools, and 41 percent don't have enough power outlets and electrical wiring to accommodate computers and multimedia equipment. So we are taking $7 million and giving it to the private schools, many of which have endowments. And 66 percent of D.C. schools have inadequate heating, ventilation, and air conditioning. So we are taking 3 percent of the kids out of there and leaving 97 percent of the kids in a situation where they don't even have basic heating and air conditioning. Public dollars should not be routed to private schools before public school students in the District of Columbia get what they need. 
Now, I want to point this out because the Senator from Indiana quoted a number of people from the District of Columbia and called them the `quiet voices.' Let me add to some of the voices from a press conference that was held on September 17, with 11 ministers and the D.C. Congresswoman Eleanor Holmes Norton. Representative Eleanor Holmes Norton, who worked so very hard on this underlying bill, so very hard with Republicans and Democrats alike, talks about this proposal that would divert $7 million to private schools and leave 97 percent of the kids without any improvement. She says: `Virtually the entire city is speaking out against vouchers. The voucher movement is trying to use the children of the District of Columbia as stepping-stones. We know what we want, and it's not vouchers. Hear the people: We can't waste money in this District.' 
The Reverend Graylan Ellis-Hagler from the Plymouth Congregational UCC Church says: `[Sterling] Tucker's letter sent to D.C. clergy was deceptive at best--it never even used the word 'voucher'. The voice of the people has been ignored. We are having vouchers rammed down our throats.' 
The Reverend Vernor Clay, Lincoln United Methodist Church: `We have voted down vouchers in the past. Our voice will not be undermined. Put money into the infrastructure of our schools if you're going to put it anywhere. [Put it] into our public students.' He said, `I'm ashamed I signed my name to Tucker's letter. I was misled my him and his hired lobbyist.' 
Reverend Dr. Earl Trent from the Florida Avenue Baptist Church: `I am outraged that Congress has stepped on our rights. We want nothing to do with vouchers. It is going to harm a majority of our schools. Let the Congressmen try vouchers in their own States.' 
Well, of course, in my State, it was voted down twice. 
Rev. Anthony Moore, Carolina Missionary Baptist Church: `We all [the ministers] stand united against vouchers. If you want to help our schools, give them money for repairs and supplies, not foolish programs.' 
Rev. Willie Wilson, Union Temple Baptist Church: `This has been a very undemocratic process. The Government should be by and for the people. As a community, we voted vouchers out, but now they're being forced on us. I was lied to by Rep. Tucker and his lobbyist. The letter was designed to rob the District of Columbia.' 
Rev. Jennifer Knutson, Foundry United Methodist Church: `Vouchers are not the answer. Public money should be spent on our public schools.' 
So here are some religious voices that are speaking out pretty unified. Eleanor Holmes Norton, who is a tremendous representative of the people here and works so hard on these bills, is adamant on this point because she represents all the children, not just 3 percent of the children. She doesn't want a 3 percent solution, she wants a 100 percent solution. It is such an abandonment of the children to go this route. That is why voters in California, which 
is on the cutting edge of change, rejected this idea. We should not give up on our children. 
Now, here is an interesting point. The Senator from Indiana has very eloquent, heartfelt remarks and, believe me, I greatly respect them. He talked a lot about the bureaucracy of the D.C. schools. He took probably several moments of his introduction to go after them. I don't defend any bureaucracy. I never have and I never will. But I have to tell you, he talked about the `nanny' State. If ever there was an example of bureaucracy, it is the way this program is going to be administered. I am not going to put my own spin on it, I say to my colleagues, I am going to read the bill. I am going to read the bill, starting on page 7 and ending--I have to get the right page number here--on page 34. That is how long it takes to explain how this thing is going to work.

Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I want to begin my remarks by acknowledging the tremendous amount of work both Senator Jeffords and Senator Kennedy have put into this bill. I know there are a few issues where there is still disagreement. I also realize that some of my colleagues may be offering amendments which they believe will strengthen the bill. 
On balance, however, I believe this is a good bill that will have a very positive impact on helping to streamline and expedite some of the FDA review processes; and thus, help patients get access to new and promising treatments and devices in a safe, efficient, and expeditious manner. There is no agency within the Federal Government which has as direct or significant an impact on the American people as the Food and Drug Administration. 
The FDA is responsible for ensuring the foods that we eat are safe, wholesome, sanitary, and properly labeled, that the drugs that we take, and that we give our pets, are safe and effective and that there is a reasonable assurance that the medical devices which we use are safe and effective. I believe the FDA has done, and continues to do, a tremendous job in carrying out this mission--it is internationally recognized as the gold standard for the approval of medical products. 
The most important aspect of any FDA reform bill must be public safety. We have the safest food, drugs, and medical devices of any country in the world; and nothing we do should ever undermine this--period. 
I also believe, however, that rapid technological advancements being made by biotechnology companies, and others, necessitate, and allow for, an expeditious product review and approval process. Obviously, this product review and approval process must simultaneously assure safety and efficacy. Again, safety and efficacy should not be compromised. 
Let me share with my colleagues an example of the technological advances being made by the biotechnology industry. Affymax, a biotechnology company located in my home State of California, has developed a technology to speed-up the analysis of drug and biological compounds. 
Affymax is a leader in the emerging field of combinatorial chemistry. Combinatorial chemistry functions by creating large numbers of diverse compounds to test against different disease targets. Affymax combines chemistries, sophisticated software and innovative molecular biology techniques to rapidly analyze and synthesize these potentially useful drug and biological compounds. 
I know about this process because I had the pleasure of seeing it when I toured Affymax's laboratories last year. Affymax has greatly accelerated the pace of drug discoveries by developing high technology automated machines which can synthesize and screen 10,000 compounds in just one week. The same testing, previously done in test tubes and petri dishes, used to take about 5 years. 
These are the kinds of advancements which I believe make it necessary for the FDA to streamline its process, in those areas which can be streamlined, so that patients may get safe and effective products as expeditiously as possible. There are literally hundreds of thousands of patients around the country waiting for the next new and promising drug therapy and/or device to be approved. 
There are, of course, other very important aspects of this bill. Not the least of which is the reauthorization of the Prescription Drug User Fee Act--commonly referred to as PDUFA. 
PDUFA is generally considered the most successful piece of FDA reform legislation in recent history. It enables the FDA to collect user fees from pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. Those fees are used to pay the salaries of hundreds of additional product reviewers and to fund product review. As a result, the FDA is able to speed-up its drug approval process and to more expeditiously get new and promising drug therapies, and medical devices, to those that need them. 
By all measures, PDUFA has been enormously successful. One measure of that success is the assertion by all parties involved--the FDA, patients, prescription drug manufacturers, consumer groups, and policymakers--that the program has worked. Certainly any program that receives the unanimous support of industry, consumer groups, the FDA, and policymakers must be extremely beneficial and should continue to be supported. 
This bill has other constructive elements as well. For example, the bill allows for expedited access to investigational drug therapies and for the expanded humanitarian use of devices. The bill also provides an incentive for drug manufacturers to conduct studies which support the safety and effectiveness of pediatric drugs and it provides for expanded collaboration and communication between the FDA and device manufacturers. 
The pediatric drug provision in this bill is especially important inasmuch as the overwhelming number of drugs on the market today are not tested for safety and effectiveness on children. It is important, therefore, that we provide drug manufacturers an incentive to test their products on children. 
I believe this provision, which gives drug manufacturers an additional 6 months of market exclusivity, is a reasonable and appropriate incentive, and will be a first step toward getting more drugs labeled for pediatric use. A very important and significant goal. 
I am also excited about the provision in this bill which allows for expanded communication and collaboration between the FDA and device manufacturers. It is important that device manufacturers and FDA examiners, early on in the review process, clearly establish the type of scientific evidence that will be necessary to demonstrate device effectiveness. Not only will this provision help bring about increased clarity and certainty in the review process, it will also help speed safe and effective devices to market. I believe this is especially important given the rapid technological advancements being made in this area. 
Finally, I want to thank Senators Gregg and Jeffords for working with me to ensure that California's proposition 65 will not be preempted by the uniformity provisions of this bill. California's proposition 65 was passed by California voters in 1986 and requires that persons who expose others to certain levels of carcinogens or reproductive toxins give a clear and reasonable warning. 
Proposition 65 has successfully reduced toxic contaminants in a number of consumer products sold in California and it has even led the FDA to adopt more stringent standards for some consumer products. For example, proposition 65 has been used successfully to reduce toxic contaminants in ceramic dishware and in lead-foil wine bottle caps. Notably, the FDA followed the lead of California in both those instances. In fact, the FDA has adopted a standard completely barring the use of lead-foil wine bottle caps pursuant to California's agreement with the wine industry to convert to tin or plastic bottle caps. So I am very pleased that the FDA reform bill now being debated will exempt California's proposition 65. 
As I stated at the outset, I believe, on balance, this is a good bill and will be beneficial in helping to get safe and effective drugs and devices to the American people in a more expeditious manner.

Mrs. BOXER. Thank you very much, Mr. President. 
I thank the chairman of the D.C. Appropriations Subcommittee, Senator Faircloth. I thank him for the hard work he has put into this bill. I thank his staff, and I thank the staff on our side. I think it is very fair to say they worked beautifully together. 
We do have basically a consensus bill here. There are a couple of provisions that I am sure Senator Faircloth isn't enamored with and I am sure there are a couple of provisions that this Senator isn't enamored with. I do believe in local control --that cities and counties should be able to make their own policies in terms of how they spend their own health funds, how they spend funds that they raise. 
There are a couple of problems in this bill. But Senator Faircloth is correct, there are no new riders here. The problems that I have with this bill this year were in this bill last year. So I just hope that as we take up this last appropriations bill--this is the 13th one--that we will have a relatively easy time of it. 
I hope that any amendments that are offered here will be noncontroversial amendments that both sides can agree to. Unfortunately, I am hearing that may not be the case, that this bill may become the vehicle for some very controversial amendments. 
If that happens, so be it. Senator Faircloth and I will be on our feet, and we will manage that in the best way we can with the cooperation of colleagues. But I really do hope that Senators from both sides would refrain from those kinds of amendments, because this bill was a long time in coming. This kind of consensus over the District of Columbia was a long time in coming. We put so much work into it, particularly the chairman. 
I see that Congresswoman Eleanor Holmes Norton has joined us to sit in on this debate. There was a tremendous amount of work on her part in getting us to reach this consensus. 
I have heard that it is possible we are going to have an amendment on vouchers. I want to make the point right here as the minority ranking member that I have discussed this amendment with my colleagues on this side. We are not going to look kindly upon any amendment that would look at helping 2 to 3 percent of the children in Washington, DC, while leaving 97 to 98 percent of those 
children without anything at all.

Mrs. BOXER. I will yield in a moment so I do not lose this track. I will absolutely yield. 
I say to my colleagues who may or may not be listening to the opening of the debate, should we be faced with that, we will have an alternative that will help 100 percent of the children--that will help 100 percent of the children. We are working on that because we are here talking about people's lives, not about philosophy of education, not about trying somebody's pet idea. We should not be doing that. We should be in fact reaching out to all the children. 
Again, I say to my colleagues, I could offer a number of amendments here that would be controversial. I do not really want to do that. I know other colleagues could as well. I know that I feel as strongly as any colleague on certain of these matters. But this is an appropriations bill. This isn't an authorization bill. This isn't the education authorization bill where we can debate, from morning till night, what helps kids most--making sure that our public schools are the best in the world or taking a small segment of children and saying, Well, if you draw the lucky straw, you can run away from a public school, instead of making that public school the greatest it could be. 
I have to say that I went to public schools from kindergarten through college. Some of the people who like me could say, Well, look what great things public schools can do, and some who do not, could say, You see, those public schools aren't very good. But the bottom line is, whatever you think of an individual who did get that chance, we do know that we have the education in this country that we can give to our children so they can be the future Senators, they can be the future leaders of the world. 
When we lose that because we decide we are going to abandon our children because of some political theory, I think it is a sad state for us. So I am very much hoping that we do not get into that debate. But if we do, as you can see, we are prepared for it. 
I will be glad to yield to my friend from Illinois.

Mrs. BOXER. I say to my friend, clearly, all the work that the chairman has done, along with Congresswoman Norton, Senator Hutchison, myself, all of our staffs, this has been hard. As Senator Faircloth has said, we have a balanced budget submitted here. As a part of the agreement on the balanced budget plan of 1997, signed into law, the President forwarded to Congress a series of budget amendments to implement the Revitalization Act for Washington, DC. 
So we are moving along. It has not been easy. I think every Member of the Senate--at least it is my feeling--would like to see us turn this Capital around. I think we have great pride in this Capital. We are very concerned about some of its problems. I think we are on the road to addressing them. 
So my colleague, in asking her question, is implying that a delay would send the wrong signal to Washington, DC, residents, would send the wrong signal, frankly, to the whole country, 
that we are backing off, and here they go again, adding extraneous matters to a DC appropriations bill. 
What I hear around is not very promising. I hear that these controversial amendments are coming. I make this plea to whoever might be listening to this opening debate on both sides: That we refrain from controversial amendments. This is the last bill we are getting together here. We should move it forward, keep it free of this controversy, move forward, do our business, do our work and get on with the Senate's business. 
Mr. President, the fiscal year 1998 District of Columbia appropriations bill was reported by the Senate Appropriations Committee on September 9, 1997, by a vote of 26 to 1. I commend the chairman of the subcommittee, Mr. Faircloth, for his efforts to produce a bipartisan appropriations bill for the District of Columbia. While the bill contains a few provisions I do not support, in most respects, I think we succeeded in producing a consensus bill. 
I will speak briefly about the three principal aspects of this bill: Federal funds in the bill; District of Columbia funds in the bill; and general provisions in the bill.

Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation authorizing the President of the United States to award a Congressional Gold Medal in honor of the late Raul Julia, a remarkable person who touched the lives of millions. 
Raul Julia is known to most people as a talented actor who performed in movies and on stage. He excelled in such films as `The Kiss of the Spider Woman,' `Presumed Innocent,' and `The Eyes of Laura Mars.' In his greater love, the theater, he starred in several productions, including the New York Shakespeare Festival's `Macbeth,' `Othello,' and `The Taming of the Shrew.' His brilliant career earned him four Tony Award nominations and a countless number of accolades. 
However, Raul Julia was more than just a remarkable actor and entertainer--through his work, he was able to conquer stereotypes unfairly attached to Latin actors and performers. It is clear that the Latino community still suffers discrimination in the entertainment field. Too many times, we see Latinos cast as gang members, drug dealers, and other negative characters. 
With his dignified presence and undeniable talent, Raul Julia was able to overcome these stereotypes. He became a role model for Latinos trying to break into the entertainment industry, and today is still an inspiration to Latino and non-Latino alike. 
Raul Julia was also a dedicated activist and humanitarian. He was especially concerned with worldwide hunger, in part because of his upbringing in Puerto Rico. In honor of his lifetime of unselfish giving, this legislation will divide profits from the sale of duplicate medals equally between the Raul Julia Hunger Fund and the National Hispanic Foundation for the Arts.

Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I come today to the Senate floor to introduce the Family Planning and Choice Protection Act of 1997, a comprehensive pro-choice, pro-family planning, and pro-women's health bill. The bill is cosponsored in the Senate by Senator Murray, and the companion bill was introduced by Representative Nita Lowey. 
This bill has three purposes: to improve family planning programs and services; to strengthen women's right to choose; and to increase research on women's health. 
In the past months and years, Congress has curbed women's reproductive rights again and again. We've seen it in the appropriations process, as women in the military and military dependents are prevented from using their own funds to obtain an abortion at military facilities. Similarly, the District of Columbia has been prevented from using local funds to provide abortion services. These are just two examples. Bit by bit, anti-choice legislators are chipping away at women's fundamental right to choose. 
Even family planning programs and services have been under attack. In June, the House of Representatives voted to cut off funding for family planning to overseas organizations unless they comply with certain restrictions. These restrictions amount to a global gag rule, prohibiting these organizations from using even non-Federal funds to provide abortion services or advocate to change abortion laws or policies abroad. 
The Family Planning and Choice Protection Act of 1997 addresses these attacks. It is a positive statement of what freedom of choice really means. The bill has three parts--family planning, choice protection, and health. 
The family planning part does four things. First, it authorizes additional funds for family planning services. Second, it bans gag rules, which have restricted the information health providers can give and women can receive about reproductive health services. Third, it requires all health plans to cover contraceptive services and drugs if they cover other prescription drugs. Fourth, it promotes understanding of emergency contraceptives, which can be used after intercourse to prevent pregnancy. 
The part on choice protection has four elements. First and foremost, it takes the basic principles of Roe versus Wade and makes them Federal law. Second, it repeals the many restrictions that Congress has placed on funding of abortions, including services for poor women, women in the military, women in the District of Columbia, and Federal employees. Third, it calls for additional Federal resources to ensure that women and health care providers have safe access to reproductive health clinics, and protection against violence at these clinics. Fourth, it directs the Department of Health and Human Services to ensure that the approval of RU-486 is based on health considerations only--not political decisions. 
The third part of the bill focuses on women's health. First, it supports funding for preventive health measures in all 50 States, such as screening for breast and cervical cancer and chlamydia. Second, it calls for funding for more research on contraception and infertility. 
The American people overwhelmingly support a woman's right to choose, family planning, and women's health research. Yet there are those in this Congress who are determined to turn the clock back. This bill works to ensure that no American woman will ever have to go back to the days of ignorance, isolation, and injustice. The women of America cannot afford to go back. The Family Planning and Choice Protection Act of 1997 calls on Congress to strengthen women's right to choose and to hold firm against further attacks on this fundamental right. 
I am proud to sponsor this important initiative in the Senate, and proud to join Representative Lowey and groups such as the National Abortion Rights Action League to make this positive statement for women's rights and health.

Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, increasingly frequent catastrophic die-offs of fish and waterfowl at the Salton Sea have led experts to conclude that the entire ecosystem is in crisis and could perish in the next five to ten years unless dramatic measures are taken. The crisis has dire implications for migratory birds on the Pacific Flyway because the Salton Sea is a critical stop for species migrating along the Pacific Coast. Urgent scientific research is underway, but scientists have not yet identified the cause of the environmental crisis. The area's agriculture, wildlife, water usage, and environmental health systems are in jeopardy. 
Another massive die-off is occurring now. Previously, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the U.S. Geological Survey worked in partnership with the California Department of Fish and Game to deal the diagnosis of dead species, rehabilitation of sick birds, and the disposal of carcasses to avert the spread of disease. Unfortunately, just a few weeks ago, California withdrew most of its field personnel due to costs and concerns about the potential health threat to state field personnel. California's withdrawal has resulted in a significant increase in the workload of an already undersized federal staff at the Sea. 
I therefore ask the Chairman of the subcommittee to work with me to include the following report language in conference. 
Spurred by the accelerated rate of species decline at the Salton Sea, the Committee directs the Secretary of the Interior to create a plan for Department of the Interior activities in the Salton Sea region in Southern California; to submit the plan to Congress no later than April 15, 1998; and to make every effort to consider any preliminary recommendations in the FY 1999 Budget request. The plan should seek to be as comprehensive as possible, and to be compatible with important factors including water transfer plans, environmental restoration needs, economic factors (including agriculture) and the rights of Native Americans. The Department shall develop the plan in cooperation with the State of California and the Salton Sea Authority. In addition the Committee urges the Department to consider the funding needs of the Salton Sea National Wildlife Refuge for operations including laboratory support from the U.S. Geological Survey, supplemental field staff during declared die-off episodes to recover dead and dying wildlife and to monitor wildlife health at the Sea, on-site and remote field hospital operations for sick wildlife from the sea, incineration and disposal facilities for dead wildlife, and for high priority research needs identified by the 1997 Salton Sea Needs Assessment Workshop.

Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I commend Senator Bryan for introducing this important amendment. This amendment does three critical things: helps to protect our environment, eliminates an unnecessary Government subsidy, and reduces our Federal deficit. 
The Bryan amendment will reduce road construction funding by $10 million, eliminate the Purchaser Credit Program which gives timber companies trees in payment for road construction costs. 
The amendment will not affect recreation and general purpose roads, and it will not reduce the money for maintenance and road obliteration. Under this amendment, if timber companies want to build logging roads with their own money, they can continue to do so. They simply won't be paid by the American taxpayers. 
Year after year, American taxpayers have spent millions of dollars to subsidize the construction of roads needed for logging in our national forests. This is millions of dollars that could have been spent on cleaning our air and water. 
Road building wreaks havoc on our national forests. Currently, there are nearly 380,000 miles of roads dissecting our national forests--that's eight times the length of the Interstate Highway System. My State of California has 44,000 miles of logging roads in its national forests. Each mile of road can have a devastating impact on water quality, stream ecosystems, fish habitat, and wildlife. Roads lead to sediment loading in streams and destroy habitat for fish and other aquatic species. Furthermore, the Forest Service has determined that 922 communities get drinking water from National Forests streams that are adversely affected by logging roads. 
I would like to raise an additional point. Earlier this year, the Forest Service began the Recreation Fee Demonstration Project. Under this Congressionally mandated pilot project, the Forest Service is now charging recreational visitors a fee to enter national forests. Now I ask my colleagues, how can we continue to any timber companies to enter and harm our national forests, while at the same time we require recreational visitors--who come to hike, picnic and enjoy our national forests--how can we require them to pay for their visit? Does that seem like a wise-use of taxpayer money--I think not. 
Under the Recreation Fee Demonstration Program there is no charge for those individuals and companies who come to harvest timber. Quite the opposit--we pay them to do so. In California, there is now a $5-per-day fee for recreational use of the Angeles, Cleveland, or Los Padres National Forests. These forests used to be open and free to recreational visitors. The Forest Service estimates that this new Fee Program will raise between $8 to $10 million this year, and somewhere between $15 to $20 million in future years. This is $10 to $20 million from the American public to visit their own national forests while the Federal Government pays over $47 million for timber companies to construct roads which are destroying those very locations the public comes to enjoy. 
As U.S. Senators we have the responsibility of priortizing--making decisions about how best to spend our taxpayer dollars in a way that will maximize benefits to the American people. We all know that there are times when that can be a very difficult task--choosing between many projects and activities that all seem equally worthy. This is not one of those times. 
I urge my colleagues to support Senator Bryan's amendment.

Mrs. BOXER. Thank you so much, Mr. President. Now, I have heard the Senator from Ohio very eloquently express his views. I think it is time that we hear from the other side. 
I am very pleased to be a member of this Subcommittee on Interior Appropriations, and I was very pleased that we were able to resolve the question of the native Americans. I felt very strongly that had we not done that, we were going to do a grave injustice to native Americans and turn our backs on history, justice, fairness, and the Constitution. So I was very pleased to support Senators McCain, Campbell, and the others. They convinced the chairman of our subcommittee to put that fight off until another time. 
I thought we were going to be OK on the National Endowment for the Arts. It comes to the floor of the U.S. Senate funded at about the same level as last year, and here we are faced with an array of amendments to wipe out the National Endowment for the Arts. Now, this is the most extreme one. It would totally do away with the National Endowment for the Arts. I think it is a very radical and very serious step for us to take. 
I want to comment, because I think it is important to correct the Record, or at least straighten it out a little bit, on the poem that the Senator from Ohio continues to hold up in this debate. It is a one-word poem. I agree, it doesn't make much sense to me either. And, yes, the NEA has made some mistakes. I'm sorry, I mean the Senator from Missouri, not Ohio. What the Senator from Missouri, Senator Ashcroft, does not tell us in his eloquent debate is that the one-word poem he holds up was funded 30 years ago; it was funded in 1968. He holds it up on the floor of the U.S. Senate as if these are the kinds of grants that are being made today. 
Now, if we are going to have an honest debate, why don't we be honest with each other? I saw that poem and I said, `That doesn't make much sense.' Then I found out it was funded 30 years ago. Now, there are many reforms that have been put into place in the National Endowment for the Arts. Does it mean there might not be a mistake or two in the future? No. There may be some out of the thousands and thousands of grants. But to hold up a poem funded 30 years ago, when I was just a kid--as a matter of fact, 30 years ago, I became a mother for the first time, and now my kids are having kids. So, yes, there was a mistake made, I agree. You know, there are mistakes made in life, but we don't just take a meat ax to the problem. And we didn't; we have made reforms. 
The other point that I think is interesting for the Senator from Missouri to imply is that the music funded by the National Endowment for the Arts is all for the elite, the upper crust, and he talked about the opera and how he doesn't go to the opera much, and yet, the opera is funded. Well, I tell the Senator from Missouri that many groups across the country are funded by the NEA: The Carter Family Memorial Music Center in Hiltons, VA, supporting a weekly series and annual festival of old-time traditional music, played on acoustic instruments. There is the Western Folklife 
Center in Nevada, dedicated to the preservation and presentation of the cultural traditions of the American West. There is the Folk Arts Apprenticeship Program, fostering the growth and evolution of Mississippi's traditional arts by bringing master traditional artists together with promising apprentices. 
So, again, we have a misleading presentation here that doesn't square with the facts. This is 1997, not 1968. Mistakes were made, but many revisions have taken place and reforms have been implemented to straighten out the problems. 
In 1993, the NEA initiated a complete overhaul of the agency's grant review and monitoring process. All subgrants to private nonapproved groups have been eliminated. Since 1996, all fine arts grants to individual artists have been eliminated. Since 1996, all grants to organizations must be for projects specifically described in the application, further increasing accountability of grantees. Since 1994, all grantees must file interim and final project reports. The final one-third of all grant payments are withheld pending the NEA's approval of grantees' interim reports. In addition, grantees must now seek written permission in advance to change grant activities proposed in the organization's application. The National Foundation on the Arts and the Humanities Act of 1965 requires a rigorous multistep review process of all applications. Diverse panels of citizens, representing wide geographic, ethnic, and cultural points of view, review all applications. Following panel consideration, all applications are then reviewed by the National Council on the Arts, which is a body of 26 private citizens nominated by the President and, yes, confirmed by the U.S. Senate to 6-year terms. Do we have so little faith in what we have already done to straighten out some of the problems with the NEA that we would, with one vote, do away with the NEA? I hope not. By the way, applications recommended by the council for support are forwarded to the chairman of NEA for a final decision. The chairman may not approve an application with respect to which the council has made a negative evaluation. So we have even put a rein on the chairman. 
Some of my colleagues have spoken on this floor expressing concerns that projects receiving funding from the NEA are obscene. Anybody who says that should know that Federal law ensures that artistic excellence and artistic merit are the criteria used to evaluate applications. The law expressly prohibits the award of financial assistance to any project or program determined to be obscene. If a mistake is made in judgment, yes, we should ensure that it is corrected, just as we must do in any Federal agency or just as we must do in our own lives. If one postman is obnoxious as he or she delivers the mail, we don't stop delivering the mail. We get rid of that person. If one military officer sexually harasses another, we don't shut down the military; we hold a hearing and we hold the perpetrator accountable. 
We have had an extraordinary number of military planes crashing, and not one person would suggest that we don't build any more military planes. Clearly, we are going to take the problems as they come to us and deal with them. And, surely, we are capable of doing that with the National Endowment for the Arts. This body ought to be very pleased that it has made tremendous progress. 
Now, speaking of the military, we spend more on military bands than we spend on the National Endowment for the Arts. I support spending money on military bands. I also support spending money on the National Endowment for the Arts. We spent $176.2 million on military bands in 1997, which is almost twice the $99.4 million spent on the NEA. Let me tell you something. If a military band played an inappropriate song, or someone was dressed inappropriately or, in any way, degraded that cultural event, we would address the situation. By the way, it is very important to our country that we keep the culture of the U.S. military and that we keep the music of patriotism that fills our souls every time we hear from it. But if there is a mistake made and an 
inappropriate song chosen, or someone is acting in an inappropriate way, we don't walk away from funding the military band. Do you know what we spend per person for the NEA? When this Senate voted $10 billion more for the military than the military asked for, I stood on this floor in disbelief, because I heard all these speeches about how much money we are spending in taxes. I agree, I don't want to spend money we don't need to spend. I want to give the military what it needs--not $10 billion more. But now we are going to save the Federal budget because we are going to cut out less than $100 million, 38 cents per person in this United States of America? 
I was called to a meeting in San Diego. In terms of politics, I would say you would call it a Republican county. I had people there from the business community, I had people there from the arts community, I had people there from nonprofit organizations, and we had elected officials there of both political parties. Do you know what their message to me was? Go and fight this thing, because every time we get a dollar from the NEA, we get matched $12. `It is important,' they said to me, `for our community.' As a matter of fact, they said to me, `Can't you fight so that we can spend 50 cents per person in a year? If we spend 50 cents per person a year, we would get that much more leverage, that much more job creation, that much more tourism, and it would help us.' So it is very interesting. In San Diego, CA, I get called to a meeting and I am told to fight for more. Here I find myself fighting just to keep what we have. 
So when we talk about tax load, don't be fooled about that. Don't be fooled. In essence, what we have here is a grant program that is far lower than it was under George Bush and Ronald Reagan who, by the way, signed all those bills for the NEA--and it costs 38 cents per person. 
Public funding of the arts is good for the economy. Now, there was a recent study by McKinsey Consultants for New York City and they said in their study that funding of the arts generates taxes, which brings down the deficit, jobs and economic growth far in excess of the amounts invested. 
I used to be a stockbroker. When you look at recommending a stock, you look at whether or not it is a good investment. Does it bring back dividends? When you put in a dollar, what do you get out? This is clear. Republicans in my State, Democrats in my State, Independent voters in my State--this is the place where they cross over party lines. They want us to save the NEA. They think it is good. They know mistakes will happen, yes, when you give thousands of grants. I think they are willing to forgive a grant made in 1968. An investment of $100 million in the NEA is relatively small. We are talking about less than one one-hundredth of 1 percent of the nearly $1.5 trillion Federal budget. 
Now, I want to share with you some pictures because I think they are worth many times a thousand words. Let me talk about Leon Bates, a world-class, highly respected concert pianist, who has appeared with major orchestras throughout the United States, Europe and Africa. By the way, my colleagues have talked about Communist countries and have somehow linked what we are doing here to communism. You know, if you look at every capitalist country in the world, every democracy and capitalist country in the world, they spend a far greater proportion of their budgets on the arts than we do. So I don't get how communism, socialism and capitalism comes in here, because in fact every capitalist democracy in the world spends more on the arts than we do. So I don't see how that gets into the debate. 
Well, here is Leon Bates. He has traveled in Europe, Africa, and the United States. He was hired by the Long Beach Symphony Orchestra to perform a piano concerto in January of 1996. 
As part of this week-long residency of rehearsals and public appearances, Mr. Bates performed for an audience of 250 members of the Long Beach Boys and Girls Club. 
Everyone in here stands up and talks about the children--everyone of us. And we should. 
I wish you could see the faces on these kids at the Boys and Girls Clubs watching this creative genius perform his work with an NEA grant enabling him to go to the Boys and Girls Clubs, be a role model, and give them a love of music. He is the perfect ambassador for classical music to an audience of children, parents, and counselors who are not exposed to the world of performing arts that often. He brought with him a full-sized concert grand piano, and in between anecdotes from his life as a musician he answered questions and played excerpts from several classical composers. The event was a spectacular success. 
He was supported in part by the NEA. Without continued support of the NEA, the Long Beach Symphony Orchestra would not be able to bring in top-quality artists like Mr. Bates. 
I want to show you another photograph which I think is wonderful. The Senator from Missouri holds up a poem from 1968. I am talking about what is going on now. This is a group called We Tell Stories. It is a performance group based in Los Angeles--a troop of actors which travels to museums, parks, schools, and libraries to perform stories for children. Its goal is to enhance cultural awareness, communication, and awaken a taste for theater and children of all cultures. 
We Tell Stories received an NEA grant to support the creation and presentation throughout the United States of work by Carl Sandburg, a great American. 
We Tell Stories began in cooperation with the Los Angeles County Museum of Art in 1981. Now in partnership with several organizations and agencies, including the Los Angeles Unified School District, and the troupe has performed for over 2 million people. In 1996, the troupe presented performances for 270,000 children. 
I am coming to the conclusion of my remarks, much to the delight of several of my colleagues who are here to speak. But I want to show you one last photograph. This is one of the audience members who was watching a recent performance in Westwood, CA, by We Tell Stories. Look at her face. It captures the promise of the arts. The great expectations of the arts, the creativity, the imagination. 
Will there be art without the NEA? Of course. I say to my colleague from Missouri, there will always be the arts. Why wouldn't there be? One of the things we do in this country is to give a very small amount--38 cents per person in this country to be matched 12 times by the private sector, the nonprofit communities, the State governments. Why would we do that? To bring these opportunities to the people of our country--and, yes; to the children of our country--because that is what the NEA has been focusing on recently. 
I just want to say that I know we have disagreements in this body. I respect those disagreements, and I respect my colleagues who come at it from a different way. But I think for the sake of this debate the American people--and I know the people in my State of every political persuasion--again, in my State, there are three issues that unite people along party lines. This is California, and I can't speak for Missouri, and I can't speak for any other State, but there are three issues that make people cross over party lines. 
One of them is the environment. People cross over, and they say, `You know, I don't care if you are a Democrat or Republican. I want clean air. I want clean water. And I want my kid to grow up without getting environmental cancer.' 
So there are no politics in that issue, in my opinion, in my State. 
Another issue is a woman's right to choose. It's the same thing--people from both parties come to me, and they say, `Please. This is a private personal matter, and it has nothing to do with Government. Stay out of our lives.' 
And the third issue is funding for the arts. I have letters. I have phone calls. I have gone to meetings. I have never seen such bipartisan audiences as I have with those three issues. 
On this issue, they all agree that we need to put the facts on the table. This isn't some political issue. This is a really important issue for our people. Will we stand up and say, `For a modest amount per person, 38 cents a year, we will work with the States, the local groups, the local symphonies, the local Girl Scouts, the groups that benefit from this to bring the arts to our people, to help them leverage that investment?' 
I can't imagine why anyone would think that it is dangerous for us to have this very modest program that sparks such enthusiasm. Are there mistakes? Yes. Are there mistakes in everything we do in life? Absolutely. But that doesn't mean we destroy the idea of the spark. 
Senator Kennedy and Senator Jeffords across party lines have worked out an agreement on this. They would block grant up to 40 percent of the NEA funds and send it back to the States. That is a good compromise. That would be up from 35 percent. 
I hope we can come together across party lines because we need to do that. 
I hope we will reject this amendment. I hope that we will support the Jeffords-Kennedy attempt to resolve this matter. And let's make sure that we fulfill our responsibilities, it seems to me, to have a small, dynamic, flexible program that responds to criticism but continues to give a modicum of support--let's use it to support dance and the arts in this Nation. 
Thank you, very much, Mr. President. 
I yield the floor. 
I reserve the remainder of our side's time.

Mrs. BOXER. I am delighted that a compromise was reached yesterday on Sections 118 and 120 to the Interior Appropriations bill. As a Senator for California and as a citizen, I am greatly relieved that these two provisions will no longer endanger the rights of our Nation's Indian tribes. 
Sections 118 and 120 would have directly violated the bargain struck between the United States and Indian tribes over a century ago. In hundreds of treaties, the United States agreed to make payments to Indian tribes in exchange for nearly 100 million acres of tribal lands. Section 118, which would have imposed a means test on these payments, violates both the letter and the spirit of these contracts. The result would have been to impose a penalty against tribal governments for improving services for their citizens and trying to achieve self-sufficiency. 
Section 120 would have gone even further in violating the promises the United States made to the tribes. It would have required tribes to choose between the payments promised to them and their inherent right to sovereign immunity, a right acknowledged in the United States Constitution. 
The United States has a long history of recognizing tribes as sovereign entities. As early as 1895, the United States Court of Appeals for the 8th Circuit ruled that tribal sovereign immunity from lawsuit is analogous to state sovereign immunity, which is protected by the 11th Amendment to the Constitution. Section 120 would have ignored this history and stripped tribes of their Constitutional right to sovereign immunity without due process. 
Sections 118 and 120 would have also significantly undermined the efforts of our Indian tribes to improve the quality of life for their people. Tribal Priority Allocations are funds targeted at addressing the most critical areas of need among our Nation's Native Americans. Without these funds, many tribes would be unable to pay for essential services, such as public schools, health care, social services, law enforcement, and road maintenance. 
Ironically, Section 120 would not have affected the few tribes that are economically able to forgo federal funding. Only the most dependent tribes, those suffering most from poverty, would have been forced to trade their sovereign status for Federal support they desperately need to survive. The effect would have been the creation of two disparate classes of tribes, those who could afford to be sovereign and those who could not. 
Sections 118 and 120 would have had a particularly harmful effect in my State. In California, there are 104 federally recognized tribes, and over 250,000 Native Americans, who would be financially and emotionally devastated had this provision become law. The vast majority of tribes desperately need Federal funds for daily survival. One third of all Native Americans live below the poverty level. Nearly half of all Native Americans living on reservations are unemployed. Of those who do work, almost a third earn less than $7,000 per year. Those Indian businesses that are experiencing any measure of success are just now beginning to create jobs and economic opportunity. To take away funding now for essential services like public schools and health care would have destroyed any chance for self-sufficiency for many tribes. 
We must also keep in mind the potentially devastating effect Section 120 would have had on our Federal courts. Our Federal court system is already severely overburdened, a situation magnified by the 97 vacancies that plague our Federal judiciary. Chief Judge Proctor Hug of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals recently reported that he was forced to cancel more than 600 civil cases due to the shortage of judges. This already overburdened system could not absorb the thousands of cases that would have potentially flooded our Federal courts had tribes been stripped of their sovereign immunity. At a minimum, such a far-reaching proposal should be subject to the careful, deliberative process of the proper authorizing committees. 
For all of these reasons, I was, and continue to be, strongly opposed to Sections 118 and 120 and I am happy to see them removed from the bill.

Mrs. BOXER. I thank Senators for their indulgence. I do not have the time to lay out all the reforms that we have made in the National Endowment for the Arts, nor to give you the details on how every single dollar that my colleague talked about is leveraged by $12 in every community across this great country of ours, because the arts, just as they are in the military, preserve our culture. We spend twice as much on military bands as we do on the National Endowment for the Arts. If the military bands make a mistake and play a song that we don't think is appropriate, we don't stop funding the military bands, because they are a very important part of our culture. If a postman acts wrong and is obnoxious, we don't stop delivering the mail. 
So I think it is very important that when we go back to this debate--and I think right now it won't be for a couple of days--that we lay out all of the reforms that have been made and all of the wonderful programs, such as the Youth Symphony, the ballet, and all the things we do with the arts, and have a fair debate. 
I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.

Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise today in opposition to the Nickles amendment to prohibit Federal funding to the Teamsters election an amendment to the Labor-HHS appropriations bill. I believe this amendment is a clear violation of the 1989 consent decree entered into by the Department of Justice and the International Brotherhood of Teamsters. 
The consent decree required, among other things, that the 1996 Teamsters' election be subject to the supervision of a court-appointed election officer, at Government expense. Due to problems uncovered related to the campaign of the elected president, however, the court-appointed election officer has refused to certify the 1996 election and has asked a Federal court in New York to formally order a new election. Inasmuch as any court ordered election is a continuation of the 1996 election, it seems clear that the rerun election must also be subject to the terms of the consent decree--including the portion of the decree which provides `The union defendants consent to the election officer, at Government expense, to supervise the 1996 elections.' 
I think it is important to recognize that this is not, or at least should not, be a partisan issue. It was a Republican administration and thus, a Republican-controlled Department of Justice, that obligated the Federal Government to the financial obligations outlined in the 1989 consent decree--not a Democratic administration. Rather, the Democratic administration, under President Clinton, is simply living up to the obligations of the consent decree. If the Nickles amendment passes, the Government would be prohibited from paying for the rerun election and thus, could be held in contempt of court for failing to adhere to the terms of the consent decree. Again, this rerun election is not a new election; rather, it is necessary to complete the 1996 election, and thus is subject to the 1989 consent decree. 
So I urge my colleagues to oppose the Nickles amendment and to support this very important consent decree to which the Government obligated itself in 1989. Thank you Mr. President.

Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from New York and I appreciate his comments on the Ryan White CARE Act. This vital program is literally a life line for people living with HIV and AIDS. 
AIDS continues to be the leading cause of death for Americans between the ages of 25 and 44. Over a half million Americans have been diagnosed with AIDS, and over 360,000 have died of the disease. In the coming year, HIV will infect some 40,000 Americans, half of them under the age of 25. 
The Ryan White CARE Act demonstrates our commitment to providing necessary health care services to these individuals and families with HIV, and to assisting communities hardest hit by the AIDS epidemic. 
Recent advances in research have provided us with new and effective combination therapy AIDS medications. These newly approved drugs offer the first real hope to the hundreds of thousands of people living with HIV and AIDS. 
Under title II of the CARE Act, the ADAP program provides access to these essential, life-saving drugs to the people who desperately need them. It literally makes the difference between life and death for tens of thousands of Americans. It is because of this new hope that new clients are coming to get the treatment they need to survive, and that is why increased funding for this program is vital. 
We have the ability and the responsibility to make these drugs available to people who need them. I don't believe anyone in this room would want his or her State to be in a position of having to cut patients off life-saving drugs because funding is inadequate. 
Given that the number of individuals with HIV continues to escalate, our commitment to providing AIDS care must remain firm. Therefore, I strongly urge my colleagues in conference to adopt the highest funding for the Ryan White CARE Act. I urge support of the House funding levels for title I and title II and the Senate levels for title III, IV, and V. 
In addition, I would like to reiterate my strong support for AIDS prevention and education programs through the Centers for Disease Control. These programs are key to stopping the spread of HIV infection and saving lives, and I urge the highest funding level possible. 
Individuals living with this disease and their loved ones known that these 
programs are saving lives, enabling patients to live life to the fullest, and preventing new infections. It is our obligation to provide the highest level of funding possible for these critical appropriations. 
Again, I thank the Senator from New York and the chairman and ranking member of the subcommittee for their tireless work on behalf of people with HIV and AIDS.

 Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, each year the Department of Labor presents the Secretary's Opportunity 2000 Award honoring a Federal contractor for the successful implementation of equal employment opportunities within its organization, and for supporting these goals in the broader community. Through its efforts, the recipient of this award must have enhanced equal employment opportunities for minorities, women, individuals with disabilities, special disabled veterans, or veterans of the Vietnam era. It also must have addressed such issues as the glass ceiling, skills gap, and multicultural workforce. 
I am pleased to say, Mr. President, that for the second time in 8 years, the Opportunity 2000 Award is presented to the Pacific Gas and Electric Co. 
PG&E takes an active role in ensuring that its employees represent California's diversity. Its various programs, including the executive development program and women in trades forum, focus attention on women and minorities. Its management works closely with numerous employee associations which represent its diversity, such as the Hispanic Employees Association, the Black Employees Association, and ACCESS, an association of employees with disabilities. 
PG&E has also adopted community based programs to aid the development of the diverse communities it serves. These programs include corporate contribution programs and welfare-to-work demonstration projects which aid in providing job training and employment to welfare recipients. 
I applaud PG&E's continued commitment to the goals of equal employment opportunity for people of all backgrounds. In the words of Labor Secretary Herman, ` * * * PG&E * * * serves as a role model for other Federal contractors.' 
I join Secretary Herman in commending Pacific Gas and Electric for this achievement, and I congratulate its officers and all its employees for being selected once again to receive this important and prestigious award.

Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, a new contaminant called perchlorate, with potentially serious health risks, has recently been detected in drinking water in California and Nevada. It is expected to also be found in drinking water in other States. 
Perchlorate is a chemical component of solid rocket fuel, munitions, and fireworks. The potential source of the drinking water contamination is solid fuel and munitions factories that produce and use large amounts of ammonium perchlorate. 
According to preliminary research, perchlorate causes the thyroid gland to malfunction by interfering with the gland's ability to use iodine and produce hormones. A malfunctioning thyroid affects the metabolism and therefore interferes with growth and development of humans. 
New safe drinking water technology to measure perchlorate became available in May 1997. Since then, groundwater wells in the most likely areas in the country have begun to be tested. 
Perchlorate has so far been detected in 69 drinking water wells in California--out of the 232 tested so far--as well as in the Colorado River and Lake Mead which is the source of water for over 10 million people in California, Nevada, and Arizona. 
It is expected to be present in drinking water wells in other States. EPA has stated that the contamination is a very serious issue. 
There is no Federal standard for perchlorate in drinking water. California is the only State that has a temporary safety standard for consuming water that contains perchlorate--18 parts per billion--but this temporary standard is based on very preliminary health effects data. 
There is no research data on the possible carcinogenic effects of perchlorate. 
Twenty-four wells in California have been closed because perchlorate levels exceed the California standard--with some wells registering a perchlorate level of 280 parts per billion--including wells at the San Gabriel Superfund site. 
Mr. President, this amendment requires the National Institutes of Health [NIH] to `from amounts appropriated under this title' conduct a study on the health effects of perchlorate with particular emphasis on the health risks to vulnerable subpopulations including children, pregnant women, and the elderly. 
It also requires that the NIH report back to the committee within 9 months--and annually thereafter--on the results of the study--including a recommendation on whether further health effects research is necessary. 
This is an important first step. 
First we need to understand more about what the potential health effects of perchlorate are. Then we will take whatever measures are appropriate to ensure that our drinking water remains safe for all, especially for our most vulnerable people--children and our elderly.

Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, once again innocent Israeli civilians have been murdered by the enemies of the peace process. I rise today to strongly condemn this cowardly act of violence and reaffirm my support for the people of Israel and for the people who want peace throughout the Middle East. 
There is no doubt that today's suicide bombings were carefully timed to inflict the greatest number of civilian causalities. Three explosions in quick succession rocked the Ben Yehuda pedestrian mall during the busiest time of day. These bombs killed at least 6 and injured nearly 200 people. 
As expected, the terrorist group Hamas has claimed responsibility for this deplorable act. They are responsible for the blood and carnage in the streets of Jerusalem, and they must answer to the grieving parents and families of the victims. 
Last month, I stood before this body to urge Yasser Arafat and the Palestinian Authority to keep their promise and crack down on terrorism. As evidenced by his complete inaction since the July 30 bombing, Mr. Arafat has not done anything to join the fight against terrorism. If the peace process is to move forward, he must find the courage to confront those who would victimize innocents to undermine peace in the Middle East. 
Secretary Madeleine Albright is scheduled to visit the Middle East next week, and there are many who believe these bombings were intended to disrupt her visit. Mr. President, this deliberate act of violence against Israel will not deter us in any way from moving forward with the peace process--indeed, it will only strengthen our resolve. It is critical that America continue to play a major role in the peace process. We will not allow terrorists to set the agenda for the peace process. We will not allow cowards to strangle the prospects for peace in the Middle East. 
In these difficult times, the need for strong American leadership becomes ever clearer. That is why I am very pleased that Secretary Albright has decided to proceed with her planned visit to the Middle East. It is my profound hope that her efforts can jump start the ailing peace process. 
I believe Mr. Arafat and the Palestinian Authority must both agree to fully engage in the peace process and take dramatic steps to halt these terrorist attacks if they wish to continue to receive financial assistance from the United States. Unless such action is taken in the immediate future, I will steadfastly support cutting any and all aid to the Palestinian Authority. It is truly unconscionable that American money, given in good faith, be used to aid those who would conspire with terrorists. 
Israel's greatest responsibility is to protect her citizens. Mr. Arafat must understand that a true peace can be achieved only when Israeli citizens are secure in their homes, in their places of worship, and on their streets. They deserve no less. 
I wish to express my sincere condolences to the Israeli people on this senseless tragedy.

Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I want to thank the Senator from Massachusetts for laying out the case as to why the Coats amendment ought to be defeated. 
I also want to thank Senator Paul Wellstone for working so hard on this issue. He shared with me some very important information from the Parkinson's Action Network, which also lays out the case in a very clear-cut way, by people who really know about what it is like to have this disease and how devastating it would be if the ban on fetal tissue research was put back into law. 
For 8 years there was a ban on this research under the Reagan and Bush years. Finally, that ban was lifted, and we are seeing hope for many, many people all over this country. We really cannot go backward now. 
I have said often on this Senate floor in relation to health issues that come before the Senate that when we act, we ought to act to improve the health of the American people. But at the minimum, Mr. President, we should do no harm. At the minimum, when we take a vote around here, we should make sure we are not hurting people. 
I think the Coats amendment would definitely hurt people, a million people who have Parkinson's disease, not to mention the others who may well get it as a result of this amendment, because this amendment would stop the progress on fetal tissue research in reference to Parkinson's disease. The prohibition in this amendment eliminates medical research, which shows significant promise of treatment or prevention of this tragic disease. 
Let's take a moment to talk about Parkinson's disease and the real people it affects. According to the NIH, almost 1 million people suffer from Parkinson's disease in the United States alone, with about 50,000 new cases reported each and every year. There is a myth out there that the symptoms begin appearing very late in life. That is not so. The symptoms begin fairly early in life, sometimes in the twenties, thirties, and forties. The average age of the disease is 57. I, myself, know several middle-aged mothers with children who suffer from this disease. 
The hallmark symptom of Parkinson's disease is the shaking or trembling of a limb, and in the later stages, a slow shuffling walk and stooped posture, not to mention the effects on speech. I know one Parkinson's victim who actually has to crawl around his home--a proud, professional man who has to crawl around his home. The only hope he has, because he has told me this, is fetal tissue research. This man has a family. This man has grandchildren. They are watching this debate and they are praying that we will reject this amendment. 
Will we deny these people the possibility of a healthier life, which may well result from fetal tissue research, which is already showing great promise, as Senator Kennedy has said? Will we deny these people hope? Will we do harm today to these people when we have not yet found a cure for Parkinson's? I certainly hope not. 
I received a letter yesterday from two medical doctors at the Parkinson's Action Network in Santa Rosa, CA. They emphasize the tremendous need to be able to continue to use fetal tissue in their fight against Parkinson's disease. Let me read from these physicians. They know what they are talking about. 
Neural cell transplantation using fetal tissue has greatly advanced our understanding of ways to replace degenerating cells in the brain. From this work, in addition, alternatives to fetal tissue may be developed. To close off arbitrarily any particular area of investigation is potentially to retard progress across a broad front by many months, perhaps many years. 
They continue: 
The ban on fetal research during the 1980's was a crippling blow to progress in many areas, including Parkinson's disease, Huntington's and Lou Gehrig's disease, spinal cord injury, and diabetes. 
These doctors are telling us don't go back to the eighties, don't go back to the years where we stopped this important research. 
Mr. President, I will share with you the comments of Dr. Jack Lewin, a medical doctor who is executive vice president and CEO of the California Medical Association, the largest State medical association in the Nation, which has over 38,000 physicians. Dr. Lewin stated: 
Research involving the use of human fetal tissue is responsible, high-integrity research. Using human fetal tissue to find cures for or to alleviate the symptoms of diseases such as Parkinson's disease is a life-giving procedure. 
Mr. President, I repeat that: `Using human fetal tissue to find cures for or to alleviate the symptoms of diseases such as Parkinson's disease is a life-giving procedure.' 
We are giving life with this procedure. Why would we vote to take away life by going back to the eighties when we had a ban on this because of politics? There is no place for that in this debate. 
Dr. Lewin said that the California Medical Association promotes all legitimate research, including research involving fetal tissue. He continues: 
It is important to dispel the myth that this research promotes abortion. This is not the case. On the contrary, research involving fetal tissue promotes the healing of crippling diseases. This research shows promise and needs to be pursued. 
Now, on the issue of abortion, I am going to refer to the history of this issue where in 1991 and 1992, there was legislation passed which directly confronted this ethical and moral issue which Senator Coats talked about today. He says we must confront this ethical and moral issue. He is right. We did do that. We did do that in 1991 and 1992. Let's discuss what is in place today in terms of the moral and ethical issues of abortion and fetal tissue research. 
First, a woman may not be approached for consent to donate the aborted tissue until after she has made the decision to have an abortion. So, no woman can be told this prior to her decision. 
Second, the donor may never be paid for donation of the tissue. It is outlawed. No one can get a single penny for donating fetal tissue. 
Third, the donor may not designate who will be the recipient of the tissue, nor ever be informed of the recipient's identity. 
This is not a question where, say, a daughter says, `I will become pregnant, have an abortion and let my father regain the use of his life.' This cannot be done. 
I think what is very important to know is that if you violate this law, you could be punished by 10 years in a Federal prison. We had a report and the report came back: `There have been no violations in the acquisition of human fetal tissue research for use in transplantation.' 
So when Senator Coats talks about confronting the ethical and moral issues, those issues were confronted in 1991 and 1992, and the Research Freedom Act clearly addresses this issue. There has been no violation at all. If all of our laws were so effective, I think we would be very proud. 
Let me offer a specific example of how doctors are using fetal tissue to improve people's lives. Good Samaritan Hospital in Los Angeles was one of the first hospitals in the country to offer a new, promising surgical procedure using fetal tissue transplants. Many of the patients who received this procedure did so only after one of the most common drugs was no longer effective in helping their illness and their symptoms had worsened, some to the point where they compared their conditions to rigor mortis--in other words, total stiffness and inability to move. 
Today, the vast majority of the more than 40 Parkinson's patients who have undergone the procedure at Good Samaritan have experienced moderate to substantial improvements in their condition. This is a life-giving procedure. This procedure gives life, gives movement to people. The issue of abortion is addressed in the Research Freedom Act and has been confronted and not one violation has occurred. We should be proud, all of us together. 
According to Dr. Oleg Kopyov, more than 70 percent of the patients who got this transplant have shown `statistically significant improvement' on standard neurological tests. The other 30 percent are now taking 20 to 40 percent less medication. None of the patients' Parkinson's symptoms have worsened following neurotrans-plantation. 
Do no harm. We should do no harm. The Coats amendment does harm, direct harm, to good Americans, and it takes away hope from a million people with Parkinson's in America. Said hospital neurosurgeon Dr. Deane Jacques:  
We are proud to be in the forefront of treatments like neurotransplantation, which clearly have enhanced patients' quality of life. 
Yet another example of the tremendous effects and great potential of this research comes from Colorado. A professor at the University of Colorado Health Sciences Center, who is conducting a study using fetal tissue, described the incredible effects on one participant earlier this year. He is quoted as saying: 
We have a woman who could never walk prior to taking her first dose of drugs in the morning. Now she can walk before her first dose of drugs, and has resumed playing tennis. 
A typical transplant patient cuts the drug by 40 to 50 percent. 
Why would we inject ourselves into this important nonpolitical health issue when, in fact, the issue of abortion has been successfully addressed in the Research Freedom Act? I cannot understand why this amendment is before us. 
Mr. President, these are significant results of helping people. Why would we even consider closing the door on this promising life-giving research? We make progress in research by opening doors, not by closing doors. 
I want to bring back the words of South Carolina Senator Strom Thurmond that he spoke on this Senate floor in 1992 when he urged this body to lift the ban on fetal tissue research. He said, `We cannot afford to lose this opportunity to develop a cure.' 
The Senator was speaking in reference to his daughter Julie, who has diabetes. He stated, `As a parent of a diabetic, I have a personal appreciation for the urgent need for a cure.' Those were Senator Thurmond's words back then. 
No doubt this sentiment is shared today by the parents, siblings, and children of those suffering from serious debilitating diseases such as Parkinson's disease. 
Senator Coats said we are only stopping the fetal tissue research for Parkinson's disease. Yes, that is on this bill. What is the next one going to be? Alzheimer's? What is the next one going to be? It is not a good precedent. We took care of this issue. Anti-choice politics should not get into this debate. This is not about choice. It is about health. We addressed the issue. Let's move on. 
I am going to quote again from Senator Thurmond, whose words 5 years ago captured the essence of the issue before us today, when he stated: 
This is not a debate about abortion. This is a debate about allowing federally sponsored research that will serve humanity and may save thousands of lives. Passage of this bill [to allow fetal tissue research] should improve the quality of life for many people with devastating diseases and disabilities. 
Supporters of this amendment may argue that fetal tissue research could still continue if this amendment were passed, as the ban would not apply to tissue obtained from spontaneous abortions or ectopic pregnancies. 
But, Mr. President, we have heard this argument before. It remains as weak as ever. Doctors have addressed this issue in earlier debates, and have stated that tissue from spontaneous miscarriages is often diseased and is difficult to collect in a safe and timely fashion to preserve the viability of the cells. The same applies to ectopic pregnancies, which produce tissue that is likely to be non-viable due to the lack of blood supply. 
So, really, we addressed this issue before. There has not been one violation. A woman may not be approached for consent to donate the aborted tissue until after she has made the decision to make the abortion. The donor may never be paid for donation of tissue, and the donor may not designate the recipient of the tissue. A GAO study reports not one violation. And if there is, someone is going to jail for 10 years. The issue has been addressed. 
Mr. President, doctors have made significant progress toward understanding and treating serious debilitating diseases, such as Parkinson's disease, through research involving fetal tissue. But we are not there yet. I know that my phone has been ringing off the hook from people who have Parkinson's disease. Some are pro-choice. Some are anti-choice. They know that issue was addressed in 1991 and 1992. They know that the only hope they have is for the doors of research to continue to be open. 
I am so pleased that we will be spending more on Parkinson's disease. I want to see us double the research at NIH. And I have joined with Senators Mack, Specter, Durbin, and others to make that a reality. 
The enemies we face are right here at home. We fear that a loved one will get cancer. We fear that a loved one will get AIDS. We fear that a loved one will fall ill. We fear that we are going to lose our parents to Alzheimer's. These are legitimate fears, and these are legitimate areas for the Federal Government to be involved in. 
I will say this. When Senator Coats says we have to confront ethical and moral issues, he is right. But what I don't understand is why he isn't proud of the Research Freedom Act, which does, indeed, protect against people saying, `Well, I am going to get an abortion because I can get money for this fetal tissue,' when, in fact, that has never happened. That cannot happen. And it will not happen as long as we keep the Research Freedom Act in place. And there is not one Member of this Senate that I know of who isn't a strong supporter of that. 
So, Mr. President, today we have a million Americans with Parkinson's watching the debate, and we have millions of other Americans with other diseases and families who love and adore these family members hoping that we will not take a step backward. I have faith that we will not do so. 
I hope that we will vote down the Coats amendment. I hope we will continue the progress. I hope we will all continue to support the Research Freedom Act so that we can feel we did everything we could to ensure that this research is ethical. 
Thank you very much. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor. 
Mr. COATS addressed the Chair.

 Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate the South Mission Viejo Little League team, the U.S. national champions, for their outstanding 1997 season. All Americans, and all Californians, are very proud of them. 
The Little League World Series has become a national tradition. Every year, the best Little Leaguers from all over the world come to Williamsport, PA to compete in the world championship. Participants leave with lifelong memories and lasting friendships. 
The journey to the Little League World Series is a rigorous one. It demands the highest levels of teamwork, talent, and perseverance. South Mission Viejo reached the World Series by winning 21 of 22 games over a 3-month stretch against the toughest competition in the United States. 
Manager Jim Gattis and coaches Allen Elconin, and Ed Sorgi guided these 11- and 12-year-olds first through the Division 55 tournament in San Clemente, then through the sectional playoffs in Santa Ana, and finally through the Division 2 playoffs in La Puente to determine the southern California champions. After winning all three of these tournaments, South Mission Viejo was on their way to San Bernardino, the site of the western regional championship. 
After trouncing New Mexico 11-1, South Mission Viejo went on to defeat Arizona and Oregon to reach the western regional semifinals--a rematch with Oregon. A 3-run home run in the top of the fourth inning gave South Mission Viejo a 11-1 lead, and the game ended under the league's 10-run mercy rule. 
The final game, against the team from Sunnyvale, CA, was a classic pitching duel. South Mission Viejo pitching rang up 11 strike-outs while Sunnyvale countered with 7 of their own. But in the end, South Mission Viejo squeezed by with a 2-1 victory, earning them a chance to compete in the Little League World Series. 
They dominated the tournament from day one, winning all three of their first-round games. In the second game, against Dyer, IN, South Mission Viejo once again displayed the depth of its pitching talent. Three teammates nearly made Little League World Series history by pitching a combined perfect game--the pitching staff missed scoring a no-hitter by a single in the last inning. 
The game for the national championship was a rematch of a first-round game against Bradenton, FL. It was another typical South Mission Viejo victory, a mix of consistent hitting, solid fielding, and strong pitching. Their victory earned South Mission Viejo the right to compete in the world championships. 
The final game was played before 37,000 fans and an international television audience. As most Americans know, South Mission Viejo jumped to an early lead, only to fall to a heartbreaking rally in the last inning by Guadalupe, Mexico. For only the second time in 3 months, South Mission Viejo lost a baseball game. 
In defeat, as in victory, South Mission Viejo represented our Nation with honor and dignity. They played hard and they played fair, earning the respect of Americans everywhere. 
But they couldn't have done it without the unflagging support and enthusiasm of their parents, their families, and the thousands of volunteers who put so much time and effort into making Little League a reality. These people are at the heart of the success of the Little League--not just in Mission Viejo but all across the nation. It is not an easy job, and too often goes unheralded. I applaud the commitment of the Mission Viejo community to their team, and I congratulate them on a job well done. 
I wish every member of the South Mission Viejo team the best of luck in the coming school year, and in future seasons. Congratulations.

Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill to repeal section 5401 of the conference report to H.R. 2015, the Balanced Budget Act of 1997. This provision, entitled `Clarifying provision relating to base periods,' will have a devastating impact on hundreds of thousands of unemployed workers in California and throughout the country. 
This provision, although labeled `clarifying,' actually overturns a very important 3-year-old Federal court decision. A provision with such far-reaching implications for all of the working men and women in our country who are currently unemployed, or, in this era of downsizing, may become unemployed, should not be tucked away in a 1,000-plus page bill. 
Let me briefly explain to my colleagues why this provision has such a devastating impact on unemployed workers. On February 21, 1997, a statewide class action suit was filed on behalf of more than 120,000 Californians who have earned sufficient wages to qualify for unemployment insurance but nevertheless must wait up to 7 months to receive their unemployment benefits. There is no question that these workers are entitled to unemployment benefits; the only issue is when the State will pay the benefits. 
In order to receive unemployment benefits a worker must have earned a prescribed amount in the 12-month period prior to his unemployment. However, because many States, including my home State of California, are slow to obtain and process wage data, a worker's unemployment compensation is often not calculated based upon his most recent wages. Rather, it is often calculated based upon wages which were earned up to 7 months prior to the date the worker files a claim. For example, if a worker files a claim for benefits in January 1997, any amounts he earned after July 1996, will be disregarded because it is outside of the `base period.' 
This policy of delaying payment of unemployment benefits causes severe hardship to unemployed workers, pushing many of these workers on to the welfare roles. The bill I have introduced today will help enable these unemployed workers get the benefits they are due in a timely manner.

 Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I want to commend the Sony Technology Center as it celebrates 25 years of success and partnership in San Diego. 
In honor of this milestone, Sony is holding a four-day gala, Sony Fest '97. Scheduled events include the grand opening of the Technology Center's newest building (nicknamed `genesis'), a keynote address by Sony Corporation President Nobuyuki Idei, business and technical symposiums, even carnival activities for children and families. Sony Fest '97 promises to be quite a party! 
Sony began in San Diego by constructing a color television assembly plant in 1972, making it the first Japanese electronics company to establish television production in the United States. Sony has been going full steam ahead in San Diego ever since. Today, 25 million television picture tubes, 14 million `Made in San Diego' televisions, and almost $500 million in capital investments later, Sony continues to explore new horizons. It now manufactures a variety of electronic products from its trademark Trinitron televisions to computer picture tubes and peripherals. In fact, Sony San Diego is currently the only U.S. manufacturer of Computer cathode ray tubes or CRTs. 
Although an international company, Sony takes pride in its efforts to respond to local and national concerns. Where possible, Sony buys and sells domestically, if not locally. For example, Sony estimates that 90 percent of the materials used in its television picture tubes come from domestic sources, and that 80 percent of finished Trinitron sets manufactured in North America are sold in the U.S. Sony San Diego is also very active in the community and in the fight for more environmentally friendly business practices. 
I think all in San Diego would agree: Sony is a great neighbor. For 25 years its presence has helped make San Diego a better place to live, work and conduct business. It is a pleasure to come to the Senate today and wish all involved a very enjoyable Sony Fest '97.

Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, yesterday in Jerusalem, the Mahane Yehuda market was ripped apart by two suicide bombs that detonated only seconds apart. At least 15 people are dead and another 170 are estimated to be injured as a result of this cowardly act. I rise today to strongly condemn the bombings, and to extend my deepest sympathies to the people of Israel. 
The images we have seen on the news have been heartbreaking. The bombs, packed with nails and screws, turned a busy produce market into a horrifying scene of bloodshed and destruction. There is simply no justification for this indiscriminate killing of innocent people. 
It has been reported that Issadin Kassam, a military wing of Hamas, has claimed responsibility for the bombing. This would not be the first time Hamas has terrorized the people of Israel and shown itself to be the strongest enemy of peace in the region. 
Mr. President, this small majority of extremists cannot be allowed to block the peace that so many people desperately desire. Everyone affiliated with the peace process must now redouble their efforts to stabilize this region that has suffered so long. 
Unfortunately, the peace process cannot move forward unless the Palestinian Authority keeps its promise to cooperate fully with Israeli efforts to combat terrorism. I am deeply saddened to report that to date, Palestinian efforts have been inadequate. Only by working together in good faith can terrorism be vanquished from the Middle East. 
Once again, I express my sincerest condolences to the Israeli people for their latest sacrifice in the quest for peace.

Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I voted for both the spending and tax reform bill because I believe they will strengthen our economy and provide needed tax relief for millions of Americans. 
First and foremost, these bills balance the budget by 2002. This is a remarkable testament to the extraordinary health of our Nation's economy. 
In 1992, just 6 years ago, the budget deficit stood at $290 billion. Thanks in large part to the economic plan passed in 1993, the budget deficit will decline this year to $45 billion. 
In 1992, unemployment stood at 7.5 nationwide and 9.6 percent in California. Robust economic growth spurred by responsible economic policy has caused unemployment to decline to historically low levels. 
This bill cuts taxes for millions of American working families. In fact, this bill contains the largest tax decrease in 16 years. These tax cuts are directed where they are needed most, at middle class working families, promoting savings for retirement and education. The $500 per child tax credit will give parents an extra helping hand in providing for their children. These are tax cuts that I wholeheartedly support. 
I am especially pleased that this bill makes important investments in health care for uninsured children. I believe the $24 billion provided in the bill for children's health care may be the most significant health policy achievement in over 30 years. 
I am very pleased that the conferees on the Tax Reconciliation bill rejected an unwise proposal to raise the Medicare eligibility age. I believe that retaining health coverage for our senior citizens must remain a national priority. 
Two important priorities of mine were also included in the final reconciliation bill. My 401(k) Protection Act, which helps secure the retirement savings of millions of Americans will soon become law. Finally, I am pleased that the conferees included my Computer Donation Incentive Act, which provides tax benefits for the donation of computers to elementary and high schools. 
I am proud to support this bill and am confident that it will add to the strong economic growth our Nation has enjoyed over the past six years.

Mrs. BOXER. I first want to thank the chairman for his work in developing this major appropriations bill that is so vital to our Nation's economic productivity and quality of life. This was an important undertaking that presented many difficult issues. I applaud him for his patience and his willingness to meet with me and my constituents in California on one of those issues involving a fixed-guideway transit project. 
As the chairman knows, my State has many requests for transportation investments, particularly in the area of bus and bus facilities. I would like to bring to the chairman's attention two projects in particular which were not funded in either the Senate or the House bills. The first was a request from the Los Angeles Metropolitan Transit Operators Coalition, which represents 8 municipal transit operators serving more than 63 million passengers annually in 36 cities of Los Angeles County. The coalition was formed to obtain economies of scale in procuring replacement and expansion buses and to provide critical alternative fuel facilities. These clean-fuel buses are vital for the Los Angeles area which has the most severe air pollution in the country. The second project involves replacement and expansion buses for the growing city of Santa Clarita. 
I ask the chairman if he would support some funding for these two projects when he meets in conference with the House on the Transportation appropriations bill?

Mrs. BOXER. As the Senator knows, the advanced technology transit bus [ATTB] under development in California has the potential to be the next-generation urban transit bus. It has already demonstrated its ability to provide maintenance savings, accommodation for the disabled, and to be a platform for a variety of clean-fuel technologies. The committee agreed at my request to provide some funding for the project under the bus program. I now understand that the chairman did meet the President's request for full funding of the project at $10 million under the Transit Planning and Research Program and ask that he support transferring the $2 million earmarked elsewhere for the ATTB in the bus program funding to Foothill Transit.

Mrs. BOXER. Thank you very much, Mr. President. I thank Senator Kerry, and I will say more about him in a moment. 
Mr. President, we have travelled a very difficult route to get to this day. There are so many people I wish to thank. I will start off by thanking my colleagues, Senator Joe Biden and Senator Bob Smith, for their constant support over the last several years on this issue. Senator Biden was the Senate author of the 1990 dolphin-safe label law that I authored in the House at that time. Senator Smith has, time and time again, proven that he is a champion of dolphin protection. Getting this compromise worked out has been very difficult--and Senator John Kerry was a master negotiator. When many of us on all sides of the issue thought we would never reach agreement, he stuck with it. We are here today in great part due to the dedication of Senator Kerry. He knows this issue, he was persistent, and he never quit. 
I also thank Senator Hollings, the distinguished ranking member of the Commerce Committee, for his leadership and, of course, Senator John McCain, the chair of the committee, for coming to the table, as well as Senator Snowe, Senator Stevens and Senator Breaux. 
One more thank you, Mr. President, to the 45 Senators from both sides of the aisle who stood with us in this fight. The only reason we got here today is they refused to vote for cloture on this bill. They made promises on it to their constituents, and they kept those promises. I feel, I have to say, that without them, we would not be here either. Senator Daschle, the Democratic leader, stood with us the entire time. 
I think we have saved dolphin lives as a result of this compromise, and we have protected American consumers. 
Mr. President, the whole argument over this bill really revolved around one issue: What is the definition of `dolphin safe'? In 1990, we decided that if you want to get a dolphin-safe label, you have to fish for tuna in such a way as to not harm the dolphin. That is, you may not chase or encircle dolphin with purse seine nets on that fishing trip. There are those who believe there are new ways to use the purse seine nets that no longer harm the dolphin. 
Many of us believe there is no proof of that. Senator Biden and I, Senator Smith, the other Senators, and 85 environmental and consumer groups said we can't change the definition until we have a scientific study that tells us it is safe for dolphins. That is what this debate is all about. 
Eleven countries put tremendous pressure on this Government to change the definition of `dolphin safe' before there was even a study. We believed that our position was the right position; there should be a study. 
We did have to give on this. We wanted a 3-year study, and we did not want any change in the label until that 3-year study was analyzed. We did not win that point. 
Essentially, the way the compromise works, in 18 months when the preliminary results come in on the study, if--if--the Secretary of Commerce believes that those preliminary results indicate that chasing and setting nets on dolphins is safe for dolphins then the definition of `dolphin safe,' will be changed. And if the study does not show that, the bill we are passing today says we will have no change in the definition. 
So, yes, this is clearly a compromise. We have won 18 months of the status quo; 18 months when consumers know that the dolphin-safe label means just that, and after that, we will live to see the preliminary results of that study, I hope, and we can have a new debate at that time. But this is what compromise is all about. 
I want to make one further statement, Mr. President, because there is a disturbing element in all of this to me, and it doesn't just come into being with respect to this issue; it is an overall issue. And that is, I have a very straightforward opinion that American laws should be made by Americans; that, in fact, our environmental laws, all of our laws, our labor laws, ought to be made by the people who are sent here to fight out those issues. American laws should not be made by other countries. 
I was disturbed in the course of this debate that, in fact, there was tremendous influence from other countries. I think there are many Senators who feel that is appropriate, and I think this debate shall continue, but we have a very good law on the books and I am proud to say it is going to stand for 18 months. 
I look forward to making sure that the bill we are passing today comes back after conference in just this format, and it can be signed into law. Thank you very much, Mr. President. I reserve my side's time.

Mrs. BOXER. Reserving the right to object, and I shall not object, I want to say to our majority leader that I thank him for his patience. I want to use this time in reserving my right to object, which I shall not, to thank the majority leader for his patience in allowing us the time we needed to come to what I think is a good compromise on this bill. 
I want to say that Senator John Kerry stepped into the breach at the moment we needed him to do so, and in working with Senator McCain and Senator Snowe, Senator Breaux, Senator Biden, myself, Senator Stevens--it was a big group of us, and a group that is pretty much known for some very strong opinions. I want to thank him. And the administration was at the table. It was not easy. 
But in the end, what we are going to do basically is keep the label the way it is and give some time for a study to begin, put all the other wonderful parts of that bill into place, and then when the preliminary results are known, we will make a decision--the Secretary of Commerce will--on whether or not to change the definition of what constitutes `dolphin safe' tuna. So I think it is a victory for American consumers. 
Just in concluding my brief remarks here--and I will not object to the unanimous-consent request--I want to thank the more than 44 Senators who stood with us, who were going to vote with us, so we were able to have the strength to negotiate this compromise. 
I will not object to the request.

I know it took many, many hours of work. I was sitting in the Appropriations Committee when the committee chose to await action on the floor. I know that a couple of the senior members of the committee were not that enthusiastic. But I do feel that what the Senator says is right. This bill, this freestanding bill that we have now passed, takes the best of both worlds. I am very excited about it. I congratulate my friend. I can't wait to go to the post office and buy that stamp. If all the American people just think about buying a few of those stamps during the year, we will be able to put so much more into research. It is just a great concept. I thank my colleague for her leadership.

Mrs. BOXER. I thank the Chair. I thank my colleague. I stand in favor of the pending Feinstein amendment calling for a study to decide whether the people would be better served by splitting the ninth circuit and, if so, how to split the ninth circuit. 
Mr. President, I am very fortunate at this time to be sitting on the Appropriations Committee, and I knew when I took a seat on that committee it was very powerful. Mr. President, I know you sit on that committee as well, and we are proud to be there. But, in my opinion, I never believed the Appropriations Committee would take it upon itself to determine how to split the ninth circuit. It seems to me if we are going to undertake this, it ought to be a study. The study ought to go to the Judiciary Committee, of which my distinguished colleague, Senator Feinstein, is a member. That is the proper way to serve the people we represent. 
Congress has redrawn circuit boundaries only twice since creating the modern appellate system in 1891. So only twice has Congress stepped in. Congress has never divided a circuit without the support of the circuit judges and the organized bar. The judges and lawyers of the ninth circuit overwhelmingly oppose the split without first studying it. The Federal Bar Association and the bar associations of California, Arizona, Nevada, Montana, Idaho, and Hawaii have all passed resolutions expressing their opposition to splitting the circuit. The Ninth Circuit Judicial Council, the governing body for all the courts in the ninth circuit, is unanimous in their opposition to splitting the circuit. 
The last time splitting up the ninth circuit was studied was during the Hruska Commission in 1973, and the principal authors of that report, Judge Charles Wiggins of Nevada and former Deputy Executive Director of the Hruska Commission, Professor Arthur Hellman, agree that its recommendation to split the ninth circuit is outdated and they oppose a split without first conducting a study. And that, of course, is what the pending amendment is about, to have a study first. 
Now, we hear many comments in this Chamber, and I heard them in committee, about the delay at the ninth circuit. Any delay in total case processing time is clearly due to unfilled vacancies. I have heard this over and over. There are 28 judicial seats on the ninth circuit. Of these 28, there are only 19 active judges. So clearly we have not done our job here, and it seems to me justice delayed is justice denied, and we better get busy. 
We have some excellent nominees pending before the Senate and before the Committee on the Judiciary. And I tell you, I have been quite frustrated that we cannot seem to get these nominations up before the body but yet we can seem to bring a split of the ninth circuit with all its ramifications here in lickety-split time without much study. I find it very, very ironic when we have the most qualified candidates who have been selected by Republicans and Democrats alike sitting and waiting here in excess of a year and a half, 2 years. 
We hear about the high reversal rate at the ninth circuit, and clearly there is a high reversal, if you look at it this way --28 of 29 cases. However, the Supreme Court elects to hear only a tiny fraction of the more than 4,000 final dispositions issued annually by the circuit. So thousands of cases stand and then 28 of 29 that they chose to hear they reversed. 
But, Mr. President, it is interesting. Four other circuits have higher reversal rates than the ninth circuit. The first, second, seventh, and D.C. circuits are all reversed 100 percent of the time. 
We also hear that California judicial philosophy dominates the ninth circuit. Ten of the circuits' nineteen active judges actually sit outside California: Arizona, Nevada, and Idaho each have two judges; Montana, Washington, Oregon, and Alaska each have one. And the circuit judges are evenly split between Republicans and Democrats. Of the court's 19 active judges, Mr. President, 10 were nominated by Republican Presidents and 9 by Democratic Presidents. So many of the arguments that we hear today seem to me to be rather specious. 
Then we hear the argument that this is very cost efficient, but no one talks about costs of the splitting up of the ninth circuit, and those would be substantial. Creation of a new twelfth circuit would require duplicate offices of clerk of court, circuit executive, staff attorneys, settlement attorneys, libraries, courtrooms, and mail and computer facilities, at an annual cost of $1.3 million. 
Now, it may be that this money would be well spent. I certainly am very, very open to splitting this court. That is not a problem for me. The problem for me is how we go about it. Before we invest this money every year plus the $3 million startup costs, and an additional $2 million for leasing space, it seems to me we ought to have a study. 
So I strongly support the Feinstein amendment. I am proud to be a cosponsor of it. I hope that wisdom will prevail. 
I thank the Chair for its patience. I thank my colleague.

Mrs. BOXER. Thank you, Mr. President. 
I rise in opposition to the amendment which is aimed at curbing the legal rights of women who work for the Federal Government to obtain abortion services through their health insurance. I strongly urge my colleagues to vote against this amendment offered by Senator DeWine. 
Who is impacted by the DeWine amendment? There are 1.2 million women of reproductive age who rely on the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program for their medical coverage. They will be stopped from using their own insurance to exercise their right to obtain a perfectly legal abortion. 
Women who are employed by the Federal Government work hard. They personally pay for their health premiums out of their own pockets. And, when it comes to health care coverage, they deserve the same health benefits as women who work in the private sector. 
To me the question is clear: Should women Federal employees or their dependents be treated the same as other women in the work force or should they be singled out, punished, have their rights taken away from them and be treated differently? 
In 1993, a majority of the Senate voted to restore the coverage of abortion services, and Federal employees were once again given equality with other women. Unfortunately, this Republican Congress overturned those rights. The Senate Appropriations Committee bill now before us provides funding for the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program. We should ensure that this funding remains in the bill. 
Anti-choice forces are chipping away at the right of women in this country to obtain safe, legal abortions by making a women's ability to exercise that choice dependent upon the amount of her paycheck and the employer who signs it. 
If there were an amendment to stop a man who happens to work for the Federal Government from getting a perfectly legal medical procedure, one that might protect his health, there would be an uproar on this floor. People would say, how dare you do that to the men of this country? Why not treat the men who work for the Federal Government the same way we treat men who work in the private sector? 
The bottom line is--this is a tough personal, private matter, and I really think it is time we trusted women to make that choice. Who are we to say that a woman who happens to work for the Federal Government or her dependents should not have this right? 
Let's ensure that all Federal employees have the rights, the protections, and the health care coverage they deserve. 
The DeWine amendment singles out female Federal employees and denies them a medical benefit available to all other working women. It is wrong. 
I yield the remainder of my time to Senator Murray. 
Mrs. MURRAY addressed the Chair.

Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, in 1991 Congress enacted the Andean Trade Preference Act which provided for duty-free treatment, or reduced duties, on many products, including fresh-cut flowers, imported from the four South American Andean countries of Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru. This legislation was proposed as a means of promoting alternatives to coca cultivation and production by offering broader access to U.S. markets for legal products. 
However, the impact of the ATPA on our domestic flower industry, particularly in my home State of California, has been devastating. Colombian fresh-cut flowers have been the greatest beneficiary of the ATPA. In 1992, Colombia exported $87.7 million worth of fresh cut flowers to the United States. By 1995, Colombian exports increased to over $374.4 million. This represents a 427-percent increase over that 3-year period. 
Domestic growers of roses and carnations have been particularly hard-hit. In 1996, Colombia exported approximately 1.7 billion roses and carnations to the United States. Colombia now controls more than 50 percent of the United States market for roses and 80 percent of the carnation market. Overall, Colombian flowers account for about 65 percent of the United States fresh-cut flower market. 
The preferential treatment accorded Colombian fresh-cut flowers under the ATPA has had a direct and dire impact on the United States flower industry--approximately 58 percent of which is located in California. This preferential treatment, however, does not appear to be serving its intended purpose. 
In 1996, an International Trade Commission report found that the `ATPA had little effect on drug crop eradication in the Andean region * * *.' In fact, quite the opposite has happened. The number of hectares devoted to coca cultivation in Colombia increased from 37,500 in 1991 to more than 50,000 in 1995. The ITC report also found that `[the] ATPA had a small and indirect * * * effect on crop substitution during 1995 * * *.' Thus, the intended goal of reducing drug crop cultivation by providing market access for alternative crops has not been achieved. 
Mr. President, I applaud and support the goals of the Andean Trade Preference Act. We must do all we can to encourage Colombia to seek alternatives to drug production. The impact of the ATPA on our domestic flower industry, however, has been far too great to justify the continued inclusion of fresh-cut flowers. It is imperative, therefore, that we exempt fresh-cut flowers from the ATPA. 
In enacting the ATPA, Congress specifically exempted certain products, that is textiles and apparel, watches and watch parts, and petroleum products, which were considered particularly sensitive to import competition. Fresh-cut flowers should be considered a similarly sensitive domestic product, and thus also exempted from the ATPA. Thank you, Mr. President.

Mrs. BOXER. The Quincy Library Group Forest Recovery and Economic Stability Act is the result of many years of consensus building in an effort to unite unlikely partners in a mutually beneficial project. 
President Clinton spurred this consensus approach in April 1993, at the Northwest Forest Summit, when he challenged Americans to stay in the conference room and out of the courtroom. One local group put this difficult challenge into action and began a series of meetings in the only place they knew they could ensure civility, and some degree of quiet--their local library. With that, the Quincy Library Group was created. 
This group of local citizens surrounding Quincy, CA, including timber industry representatives, local environmental activists, and public officials, have been meeting periodically since 1992 to develop a timber management plan for the areas' surrounding national forests. They did not have an easy task before them--promoting the local economy, preserving jobs, and protecting the environment. 
Several years ago I visited Quincy, CA, and had an opportunity to see first hand the problems in the forests and the community at work. Since that time, I have worked with the Quincy Library Group, U.S. Forest Service, Senator Feinstein, Members of Congress, and the national environmental community in an effort to reach a consensus. 
I believe that is what we have before us today. This legislation will implement the Quincy Library Group proposal for managing the Tahoe, Lassen, and Sierraville Range of the Tahoe National Forests through biological reserves, fire suppression, riparian restoration, watershed protection, and monitoring. 
The House passed a companion bill earlier this week by a near unanimous vote. I believe the overwhelming success in the House was largely due to the inclusion of provisions which ensure compliance with all environmental laws, as well as interim and final California spotted owl guidelines. 
This proposal has gone through years of collaboration from many dedicated people with many different interests. We now have legislation to implement this consensus--legislation which can be fined tuned as it moves through the legislative process. 
The President's statement of administration policy on the House companion bill suggests further refining the bill so that the pilot project will end once the Forest Service completes the appropriate forest plan amendments. I would be supportive of such a change to the bill. 
Some have suggested that the legislation increase the protection of all old growth forests in the area and ensure that logging and road building be prohibited in all roadless and sensitive areas. We should consider that change. 
I hope that these concerns can be addressed as this bill moves through the legislative process. Nonetheless, many positive changes have been made to the legislation over the last few months, and although some outstanding concerns still remain, the legislation now provides many of the safeguards necessary to protect the natural environment while promoting the local economy. 
I want to thank Senator Feinstein, Congressmen Fazio, Miller, Herger, Young, and the Forest Service for their efforts on this legislation. It has truly been a cooperative effort and I hope we are able to pass this legislation quickly so that we will soon be able to see the proposal implemented on the ground.

 Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I would like to ask the ranking member on the Energy and Water Development Subcommittee, Senator Reid of Nevada, a question regarding the funding for hydrogen research in the appropriations bill for fiscal year 1998.

Mrs. BOXER. Thank you. As you well know, funding for the Department of Energy's Hydrogen Research Program is critical to the advancement of hydrogen technologies. The President's budget for fiscal year 1998 requested $15 million. The committee, through the efforts of the ranking member, increased the budget request by $4 million to $19 million. As we know, the Hydrogen Future Act that passed by the Congress last year authorized $25 million for fiscal year 1998. 
As the ranking member of this appropriations subcommittee I sincerely appreciate his efforts to increase funding for hydrogen research in the energy and water development bill. As we know, the Department needs the funding that they have requested to pursue the furthering of hydrogen by working with the private-sector and our national laboratories to demonstrate the effectiveness as well as the safety of hydrogen. I know that my ranking member is as interested as I am in the demonstration and validation of hydrogen power technology. I support his request for a demonstration and evaluation at the Nevada test site as part of the Department of Energy's Hydrogen Research Program budget. 
I would like to ask the distinguished ranking member if he would elaborate on the intentions of the committee report language as it relates to the Department allocating funds for a comprehensive validation program at the Nevada test site. If I understand this correctly, the distinguished Senator from Nevada is suggesting that the Department should begin phase 1 of a program in fiscal year 1998 that will establish at the Nevada test site a single location to administer testing and evaluation of industry-led hydrogen energy systems.

Mrs. BOXER. I thank the Senator very much. 
Mr. President, I just didn't want the Record to go by without stating my disagreement with my friend from Arizona. We have 85 environmental groups, including the Sierra Club and the Humane Society, on the side of reasonable compromise. This is an area where I don't have to agree with the administration. Sometimes those occasions do occur. 
Senator Biden and I teamed up in 1990. We passed the Dolphin Protection Act. This bill overturns it. Frankly, it was done in a way that should have brought the parties together in the first place. So I think we are doing this a little bit backwards in the sense that the compromise, I think, is going to come. 
By the way, I have no problem with bringing up the bill at any point. We are prepared to do that. So, if you want to bring up the cloture vote on the motion to proceed to the bill, we are prepared to do that. But we think we can compromise this. We see Senator John Kerry now playing a lead role--Senator Biden, I, Senator Smith, and others on both sides of the aisle, in a bipartisan way, are ready to put forward an excellent compromise. If we get that, this bill can go through in moments.

Mrs. BOXER. The amendment that I have sent to the desk is a bipartisan amendment cosponsored by Senators Allard, Smith, Leahy, and Torricelli, and it concerns the CAMPFIRE Program in Zimbabwe. I particularly want to pay tribute to my colleagues, Senators Allard and Smith, for being so strong on this subject. I thank my staff and the staffs of the chairman and ranking member for working on a good amendment that we can all agree on. I am particularly grateful to Senators Leahy and McConnell for their assistance and cooperation on this amendment. 
Briefly, our amendment would maintain the positive aspects of the CAMPFIRE Program while restricting U.S. taxpayer funds being used for activities which are inconsistent with the goals of sustainable development for people and management of natural resources. 
My amendment would assure that no taxpayer money is used to finance the trophy hunting of elephants and other endangered species or no taxpayer money could be used for any lobbying activities to weaken elephant protection standards. So we really basically do two things: Taxpayer dollars from America cannot be used to foster trophy hunting in Zimbabwe and taxpayer money cannot be used to lobby Senators or House Members or administration people to weaken elephant protection standards such as the ban on ivory. 
Mr. President, these magnificent animals should be protected, not exploited. Our amendment requires USAID to submit a report to Congress on alternatives to trophy hunting and the impact of the CAMPFIRE Program on people and wildlife of Zimbabwe. I think these are very important steps in addressing the criticism about the way the program works. Some of us would have liked to have gone further than this, but we think that this amendment, the way it is drawn, will receive unanimous support, and we think is an important step to be taken. 
The CAMPFIRE Program is beneficial to many rural impoverished people in Zimbabwe. It helps to provide the skills and tools necessary to enable local communities to make local decisions about how to manage their natural resources and generate revenue. 
However, there are certain aspects of the program which do not promote sustainable development for rural people or improve natural resource management. My amendment restricts United States taxpayer dollars from being spent on those needless activities and directs all funds to be used to maximize benefits to rural people while strengthening natural resources management institutions in Zimbabwe. 
I am aware that there have been many concerns raised about the trophy hunting aspects of the program. I do not support trophy hunting and I do not believe that one penny of taxpayer money should be used to finance trophy hunting. My amendment will ensure that no U.S. taxpayer dollars are directly spent on trophy hunting activities. 
However, I do recognize that trophy hunting will continue in Zimbabwe. I believe that we need to provide countries like Zimbabwe with viable alternatives to trophy hunting which continue to generate income and promote sustainable development without involving the consumptive use of wildlife. My amendment requires USAID to submit a report to Congress providing alternatives to trophy hunting, and the impact of the program on the people and wildlife of CAMPFIRE districts. 
People in Zimbabwe are living under very different conditions than we in the United States. We must recognize these differences in our approach to development while maintaining our high values and ideals. The CAMPFIRE Program in Zimbabwe will end in 1999, but USAID-funded development programs will continue for years to come. I am hopeful that the report which USAID will submit to Congress, will provide the United States with ideas for income diversification for future programs so that we can move away from the consumptive use of wildlife as a management regime. 
USAID has proposed several improvements to the CAMPFIRE Program in recent months. These improvements are the result of the concerns raised by many concerned citizens and organizations such as the Humane Society of the United States. I commend the Humane Society for their efforts to make the United States more responsible for the use of taxpayer dollars. I also applaud USAID for taking steps to address these concerns. I believe that this process has been beneficial for all of those involved--especially the people and wildlife of Zimbabwe. 
I want to thank Senators Leahy, Smith, Allard, and Torricelli for helping to make this a bipartisan effort toward improving development aid, maximizing benefits to local people, promoting a healthy elephant population, and ensuring that U.S. taxpayer money is used wisely.

Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, thank you, very much. 
Mr. President, will you tell me when I have used 10 minutes? Then I will wrap it up because I know the Senator from Missouri is waiting. We are very proud that he is here to speak in behalf of the Grams-Boxer amendment. I am also proud to say that Senator Daschle, the Democratic leader has endorsed the Grams-Boxer amendment. 
Mr. President, my colleague from Illinois started off his argument by quoting Lenin. He said Lenin said that `The capitalist will sell you the rope that you need to hang him.' I never agreed with Lenin, and I don't agree now. 
But, in addition, I really do believe that the Cochran amendment, as drafted, amounts to us hanging ourselves. What do I mean by this? I do not believe the Cochran amendment does anything to protect our national security. Rather, it harms it, I believe, a very substantial way, our international competitiveness in an industry that is leading America into prosperous times. 
This is a view that is shared by Defense Secretary William Cohen, by Commerce Secretary William Daley, and our National Security Adviser, Sandy Berger. This bipartisan team has told us very directly that the Cochran amendment is harmful. I truly hope our colleagues will take a deep breath, step back and review these letters.

<TEXT>
Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, let me share with my colleagues part of the letter the Secretary of Defense has written in opposition to the Cochran-Durbin amendment and the Spence-Dellums amendment. Secretary Cohen says, `I believe they are unnecessary and would undermine the flexibility that we need to adapt to the changing security requirements and technology trends.' He goes on to say, `We have a system and adequate authority under current law that can deal appropriately with unauthorized exports and diversions.' 
The Secretary of Commerce is very strong on this point. He says the Cochran amendment's proposed control levels are outdated because of the rapid pace of development of computer technology, and the widespread availability of the semiconductors required to run those machines. 
From the National Security Adviser, Samuel Berger, we hear this. `We [referring to the Administration] believe it is a mistake to set these export control limits in concrete by mandating amendment of statutes, particularly in view of the rapid growth in computing power available worldwide.' 
He continues, `[the Cochran amendment] drastically undercuts our flexibility to adjust controls to keep pace with technological change * * *.' 
I think what we see here in this debate is the bipartisan effort here to ask our colleagues in the Senate to really look at the Cochran amendment and to realize that it will really simply hurt us. 
It reminds me of someone who wakes up in the morning feeling great, everything is going well, and then they just knock themselves in the face, knock themselves out. For what reason? There is absolutely no reason. 
There is no reason to put these controls back on these midlevel computers. The current policy that is in place did not occur in a vacuum. The decision to decontrol was based on the collective wisdom and judgment of the Department of Commerce, the Department of Defense, the State Department, intelligence agencies, and the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency. And the decision to decontrol the chips, that run the computers, was made by the Bush administration. Why were those decisions made? They were made because computers in the 2,000 through 7,000 MTOPS ranges are mid-level computers that are widely available. They are not supercomputers. 
Let me repeat this because I know there is a lot of confusion on this issue. Computers in the 2,000 MTOPS through 7,000 MTOPS range are not supercomputers. In fact, many computer servers will top the 2,000 MTOPS threshold next year. 
A server is the central computer in an office, and it holds information which all of the other computers in the office can access. It is expected that next year a number of law firms, distribution centers, dentist's offices, doctor's offices, car dealers, police departments, and even congressional offices will be using servers at the 2,000 MTOPS level. Yet, if the Cochran-Durbin amendment were adopted, we would reimpose export controls on computers that we may be using right here in the Senate next year. 
Technology is advancing, as Secretary Cohen noted. It is being developed and is moving forward at a very rapid pace, not only in this country, but in other countries as well. We cannot stop it, nor can we slow it down. 
So it seems to me, Mr. President, our export policy should move forward, to keep pace with technology rather than move backward. By reimposing export controls on midlevel computers, as called for in the Cochran amendment, we would in fact, however, be moving backward. Moving backward, Mr. President, without a clear national security rationale for so doing. That is not coming from Senator Boxer or Senator Grams or Senator Bond. It is coming from Secretary of Defense William Cohen. It is coming from Samuel Berger, the National Security Adviser. 
Our goal as policymakers should be to establish export policies which are efficient, effective and competitive while also ensuring that our national security objectives are maintained. Current law achieves that objective. 
Does this mean we should allow companies to sell any computer at any level to any country notwithstanding our national security interests? Of course not. Our national security interests are paramount. They are paramount. Our export policies absolutely must ensure that our foreign policy and security objectives, particularly as they relate to nonproliferation and counterterrorism, are maintained. 
The Cochran-Durbin amendment, however, restricts our export competitiveness without furthering our national security objectives. Let me explain why the Cochran-Durbin amendment will not further our national security objectives. 
First, the independent study conducted in 1995 concluded that exports of computers in the 2,000 to 7,000 range, destined for civilian use, posed no national security risk. The Cochran amendment, however, would severely restrict the sale of these computers to foreign commercial users because, as my colleague Senator Grams has so clearly stated, it takes an average of 107 days for the appropriate agencies--Commerce, Defense, State, and others--to issue export licenses on these mid-level computers. to buy a midlevel computer if you were a person who went into the store in, let us say, a city in Israel; that is one of the Tier 3 countries that would be impacted here. 
Let me pose a question, and I think anyone can answer it. If you were a businessman in, let us say, Israel, that is one of the Tier 3 countries that would be impacted under the Cochran amendment, and wanted to purchase a computer from a United States manufacturer, but you were told that the United States manufacturer from whom you wanted to purchase the computer would have to wait an average of 107 days to get an export license to ship the computer, would you purchase that computer from the United States manufacturer, or would you opt to purchase a similar computer from a Japanese manufacturer? Clearly, the answer is that you would purchase from the Japanese manufacturer and not the American manufacturer. 
Now, if there was any national security reason for this, I would be standing here arguing for it. But I do not see what national security objective is furthered when an Israeli dentist cannot go buy a computer for his office. I frankly do not see it. Second, we also know that sophisticated advanced nuclear weaponry design is not conducted on midlevel computers in the 2,000 through 7,000 range. And again, as my colleague Senator Grams, has clearly stated, the computers are just boxes. It is the chip inside the computer which makes the difference, and those chips were decontrolled under the Bush administration. 
Third, and I alluded to this earlier, we know the Japanese make these computers. We also know companies in France, Taiwan, the United Kingdom, and Germany all manufacture computers in the 2,000 through 7,000 MTOPS range. 
And how about this? China is producing computers at the 13,000 MTOPS level, far above the level which the Cochran amendment seeks to control. 
So what are we doing here? We are hurting one of the most robust and important industries in our country, and there is no reason to do it. We cannot control the uncontrollable. If we were the only ones in the world that made these computers, this debate would be worth having, but we are not.

Mrs. BOXER. So we cannot turn back the hands of time. All of those countries make these computers already. We are hurting ourselves for no rational purpose. 
Finally, in analyzing this issue, I think it is also important to consider whether we as Senators have the expertise to determine what makes a supercomputer. I really believe we do not have that expertise among us. The Secretary of Defense has all of that expertise at his disposal. The National Security Adviser has all of that expertise at his disposal. The Secretary of Commerce has all of that expertise at his disposal. And each opposes the Cochran amendment. So I do not think that any of us, individually or collectively, possess the knowledge to make that kind of determination. I think the fact that we have Senators referring to a 2,000 MTOPS computer as supercomputer evidences that fact. We know that 2,000 MTOP computers are not supercomputers because the experts have concluded otherwise. 
So I hope that my colleagues will join the Democratic leader and will join us and vote for the Grams-Boxer amendment. I think we should study this issue further and defer to the Secretary of Defense and to the intelligence agencies. I think that would set us on the appropriate course. 
I thank my colleague for his generosity, and I yield back to him.

Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I want to say to my colleague, it has been a pleasure working with him and his staff. I think that what we are offering here is a very wise alternative to an unwise policy. I am looking at the Tier 3 countries, and my colleague from Mississippi said there is no difference in what will happen to Israel under this amendment than under current law. It isn't true. Tier 3 includes Israel, Romania, who wants to join NATO, Latvia, and other countries. If a business wanted to buy a computer that fell in the 2,000 to 7,000 MTOPS range, which we have already established is mid-level computer, and we are going to have them right here in the Congress next year, then that business would have to wait an average of 107 days. 
Mr. President, this Cochran amendment is kind of a `Back to the Future' amendment. It might have some application if it was offered many years ago, but it doesn't have any application now. I think the Grams-Boxer amendment, which has so much support from Secretary Cohen, from Sandy Berger, from Secretary Daley, from so many Senators on both sides of the aisle, I think that is the appropriate course to take. I really hope that our colleagues have listened, and I hope that the Grams-Boxer amendment prevails. I yield back to my colleague.

Mrs. BOXER. I thank my colleague from Washington for yielding and for her leadership, and I thank our ranking member, Senator Levin, for his very strong statement in behalf of women in the military. 
Mr. President, my colleague from Indiana says this is about philosophy, but I could not disagree with him more. This is about how we treat our military personnel who happen to be women. 
Now, my colleague from Idaho says taxpayer money should not be used in any abortion and therefore this policy ought to be kept. The fact is the women, who have the right to choose under American law, would make that choice and pay the bill, including the overhead, at the military hospital. 
Mr. President, it is very hard to ever repay our men and women in the military for the sacrifices they make every single day. They have no idea at what moment they are going to be called upon to put their very life on the line. Their families live in fear that that could happen any moment, whether they are stationed in Bosnia, as many are now, whether they are stationed in Saudi Arabia, as many are now. 
How would you like to be a female stationed in one of those countries, knowing what their attitude is and their philosophy is about a woman's right to choose, and be forced into one of those hospitals? Oh, you can get on a plane in an as-available situation. What if it is not available? What if it means you have to take a tremendous amount of leave time and that complicates your life? This is a decision a woman makes--perhaps my colleagues are unaware, if a woman decides to exercise her right to choose, this is not a light decision. This is something she has come to grips with, and it is her right in this country until they have the votes to overturn it, and I hope I never see that day in the Senate. 
So, Mr. President, we can never repay the men and women in the military, so what do we do in this policy since this Congress changed hands and a President's policy was overturned? This is how we repay the women in the military? We tell them that we will not allow them their constitutional right to choose a safe, legal abortion in a military hospital even if they pay every single cent for their procedure. 
Now, we know that no level of pay could adequately compensate our men and women in the military. There is no price you can put on the patriotism that is involved.

Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am offering an amendment today, and I am very proud it is coauthored by the two Senators from Iowa, Senator Grassley and Senator Harkin. This amendment, I think, is a good-government amendment. It is, in many ways, a reform amendment, and it not only applies to the Defense Department but it would apply Governmentwide. 
What we do is permanently cap taxpayer-funded compensation, in other words, taxpayers' funds that go to pay the salaries of contractors, at the same amount as the salary of the President of the United States. 
I want to repeat that. Right now, because of loopholes in past amendments we have brought before the Senate, executives and companies who contract with this Government have no limit on what they can get from the Government. So taxpayers are funding salaries of $500,000 a year, $800,000 a year, $1 million a year. As a matter of fact, we have one report of one company which spread around $33 million in compensation to its executives. 
This amendment will ensure that taxpayers are no longer forced to foot the bill for exorbitant salaries of contractor executives. 
It is important to understand what the bill does not do. Our amendment does not limit the salaries of contractor executives. It only limits the taxpayer portion of their salaries. So if there is a contractor executive, whether it is defense or anywhere else in the Federal Government, who is contracting with the Federal Government, we are saying in 1 year, the maximum pay they can get from Federal taxpayers is equal to that pay of the President of the United States, or $200,000. But if they have business from the private sector and they want to pay their executive any level, that is fine with us. We are just saying no more than $200,000 a year for a contractor executive. 
Our amendment has been endorsed by Taxpayers for Common Sense, and today I placed a letter on the desks of Senators. I want to read from it. 
The letter goes to all Senators, and it says:  
Support the Boxer-Grassley-Harkin amendment. Taxpayers for Common Sense supports the Boxer-Grassley-Harkin amendment to the DOD authorization bill to limit taxpayer reimbursement for defense contractors executive compensation. Passage of this amendment would provide a consistent and uniform standard to defense contractors on executive compensation. Since Fiscal Year '95, the issue of executive pay has seen much legislative action. In '95, Congress limited the reimbursable compensation on some contracts. The DOD Appropriations Act of Fiscal Year '96 limited some compensation but only for the final third of the fiscal year. 
And so what they say to us in this letter is that the GAO report revealed that one contractor paid its top executives more than $33 million in compensation over the $250,000 limit because there were loopholes within the legislation. 
Taxpayers for Common Sense urges all Members of the Senate to support the Boxer-Grassley-Harkin amendment to limit this compensation. It is a step toward fiscal responsibility. 
Mr. President, we certainly know that one of our proudest accomplishments as a Congress is bringing down this Federal deficit, and we do it in many ways. One of the ways we have done it, frankly, is that we have been pretty tough on Federal pay. We have wonderful men and women working for the Federal Government, and many of them, doing the work of private sector executives and private sector workers, get much less. They love their jobs, they work hard, and they have had to make some sacrifices. But somehow, it seems to me, we ought to ask those who contract with the Federal Government to make a little sacrifice. Frankly, I don't think it is bad to get the same pay as the President of the United States. I think that is pretty good pay, and that is what the Boxer-Grassley-Harkin amendment does. 
So Congress has, in fact, scrutinized this issue before. We have been outraged about it before, but we haven't resolved this problem. We keep passing limited caps, and they are not working. 
We took them as first good steps, but they were sporadic. We suspected their effectiveness would be very limited, and the GAO report confirmed our worst fears. 
We already talked about one major contractor who paid its top executives more than $33 million over the then $250,000 limit. The GAO concluded that that particular billing was allowable because the 1995 cap had so many loopholes. In fact, less than 1 percent of all contracts were covered by the 1995 caps. It seems to me, as we look back on what we did, it sounded good, but it didn't work, and we tried to control executive pay for these contractors, but we didn't succeed. We believe that the Boxer-Grassley-Harkin amendment will close that loophole very, very clearly, and that is why we received support from Taxpayers for Common Sense. We need a clear and consistent uniform standard on executive compensation, and that is exactly what our amendment would do. 
I commend the Senate Armed Services Committee for its good-faith effort to address this issue in the DOD authorization bill. The committee acknowledged that the current system doesn't work, and it wisely rejected an administration compensation proposal that would continue to permit millions of dollars for executive pay. However, I suggest that the committee's approach, while moving in the right direction, doesn't go far enough. 
The committee proposal would limit reimbursable compensation to the medium level of pay for all senior executives at large public companies. I don't think we should tie the pay of executives who get paid by taxpayers to the pay of executives who get paid in the private sector. Where is the common sense on that? I think we are going to hear arguments such as, `Well, these Federal contractors are not Federal employees; after all, they could go to a private sector company.' Fine, so could Federal employees. That is no argument. This is about taxpayer money, Mr. President. This is about fiscal discipline. This is about trying to balance the budget and not doing it on the backs of just one group of people. This isn't right. The sacrifices have to be shared. 
So the committee proposal sets what they call reasonable executive compensation through a formula based on the salaries of other wealthy private sector executives. I just think that is a faulty approach, and it is business as usual. 
It makes more sense to use public sector salaries, Federal Government salaries to set the compensation from taxpayers. After all, for their work on Government projects, contractors become, in effect, Government employees, and I can't imagine how we could rationalize paying them more than the President of the United States. 
A second problem with the committee proposal is that it is limited to the five highest ranking executives of each contractor. First, it has a level of pay that is way more--way more--than the President of the United States and, second, it places no limits on the other senior executives, just five in each contractor. So there are ways to get around it. 
Under the committee bill, a high ranking executive could continue to bill multimillion-dollar salaries and bonuses to the taxpayer if he or she was not named as one of the five most senior at the company. You can see that game being played. 
Our amendment is simple, it is clear. It says in one fiscal year, taxpayers can't pay a salary higher to the contractor than it pays to the President of the United States. I think that is a pretty good linkage for these contractors to be hooked to the salary of the President of the United States. 
Again, we don't limit the total an executive can make, only the total they can make from taxpayers. If there are two sides to their business and they are working for taxpayers and they have other projects, they can get paid whatever the company decides to pay them, but not the portion from the taxpayers. 
I am very proud to be working with my friend, Senator Grassley. When I was in the House and he came over to the Senate, he and I teamed up on many occasions on procurement reform. We 
worked together on spare parts that were costing a fortune, those days of the $7,000 coffee pots and the $400 hammers and the $600 toilet seats. We worked very hard on those issues. We worked very hard to stamp out taxpayer fraud. 
So it is just with great joy that I work with him, again, on this. I think it is a good, solid amendment. We are proud of the support we are getting. I yield as much time as he might consume to my friend, the Senator from Iowa [Senator Grassley].

Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, it was interesting to see the Senator from Pennsylvania get very emotional about the fact that we would--Senator Grassley and I and Senator Harkin--limit the taxpayer payments to individual executives who are Federal contractors to the pay of the President of the United States. 
First of all, I am not sure he understands our amendment. We only limit the taxpayer portion of their pay. If they work in the private sector, that is up to the shareholders to determine, No. 1. 
No. 2, the Senator from Pennsylvania says, `My God, if we cannot get these executives into these defense firms, these high-paid executives, our national security is at stake. We better pay them more, much more than the President of the United States.' Let me just say, what about the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff? He is a Federal employee. I do not hear people coming in here and recommending that his pay be raised. What about the person who is the head of the FAA? What about the air traffic controllers? 
We have people in the Federal Government who risk life and limb, but we are here today hearing the committee defend executives in fancy offices in big firms who contract with the Federal Government. 
I ask the Senator from Iowa a question.

Mrs. BOXER. We thought we put a cap in place, I say to my friend, and yet we know in one company, executive No. 1--and we will not identify that individual--in one defense company, earned $4 million in 1 year, nearly all from taxpayers. Executive No. 2, $3.9 million, executive No. 3, $2.3 million, executive No. 4, $2.3 million, executive No. 5, $2.2 million, for a total among those five executives of $14.8 million. 
I ask my friend from Iowa how he thinks the people in Iowa would react when they learn that 1 executive got over $4 million in one calendar year, in a year when, by the way, there were layoffs in that company; if he could answer that. And also talk to me, if he would, about the committee's proposal which they say would limit pay to $350,000--if the Senator agrees with that. 
If he could give me the reaction and then his opinion on the committee's plan.

I understand that my colleague has a chart which shows different analyses of that, because I greatly question it. Last year, we thought we were capping it at $250,000, and people got $4 million. I wonder if my friend can share with us that chart, which shows opinions other than the committee's opinion on where these caps will actually fall--not at $350,000, but more into the millions.

Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I would like to say to my friend that I really appreciate his coming up with those charts because taxpayers thought a year ago that all this was taken care of. They honestly thought a $250,000 cap would work. Now we see executives making $2 million, $3 million, $4 million, as if we didn't have a budget crisis around this place. It is unreal. 
Now we are told that the new committee policy will lead to a $350,000 cap by some fancy magic computation. I think what the Senator from Iowa has shown us is a warning here. We don't want to come back next year with more of these charts that say to our friends: You miscalculated it and executives are getting $2 million a year from taxpayers. This is wrong. 
So I want to, again, thank my colleague very much for coauthoring this amendment. I retain the remainder of my time.

Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, sometimes I feel like Alice in Wonderland. And this is one of those moments. 
The Senator from Virginia says this is an innovative idea--the amendment by myself and the Senator from Iowa. Mr. President, this is the same idea that this body voted for unanimously 2 years ago except we set a cap at $250,000. Now we set it at the level of the pay of the President of the United States. So this isn't innovation. This is tightening the loophole. 
Every Member of this body went along with this notion of capping the amount that taxpayers would pay in 1 fiscal year to a Federal contractor from taxpayer funds. They want to get millions of dollars from the private sector. God bless them. But we believe it is the appropriate thing to do when you look after the taxpayers' purse to put a reasonable limit. 
I wish that I had heard the same passion that I heard today from the Senator from Pennsylvania when we debated the minimum wage. 
I will tell you. The Senator from Pennsylvania says, what about a new firm starting out and they know they can only make $200,000 a year rather than the Federal Government? Wouldn't that inhibit them? I think for a new firm starting out that is not a bad salary. Maybe in Pennsylvania $200,000 a year isn't a lot of money, but where I come from it is a lot of money. And we don't limit what people can make outside of the Federal Government. 
Then the Senator from Pennsylvania says he doesn't care what executives get. He doesn't care. Well, he should care, if five executives in one company pull down $4 million, $3 million, $2 million, $2 million, $2 million respectively in 1 year when we thought we had a $250,000 cap in place. 
So I would ask my friend from Iowa if he would like to sum up because we are getting to the end of this debate. I don't quite understand why our proposal is being looked at as something brand new when in fact we thought the $250,000 cap was in place, and now what we are all trying to do is tighten down the hatches and make 
sure people do not take advantage of taxpayers, and we are treating this as if we have come up with some new idea. If he would care to comment on that and perhaps close the debate, I would be happy to yield him any remaining time.

Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise to strongly oppose efforts to authorize additional rounds of base closings. I believe that it is bad policy to close more bases without accurately knowing the ramifications of previous cuts. 
Congress has already approved four rounds of base closings, the latest round occurring in 1995. My State of California has suffered unfairly during this process, losing 27 major installations. Job losses from these closings are estimated to exceed 250,000, and the total economic loss will top $8 billion. 
Although the California economy is experiencing an economic upturn, unemployment in my State continues to run two percentage points above the national average. It is clear that communities in California are disproportionately being hurt by the BRAC process. 
It is unfair to ask my State to bear the brunt of yet another round of base closings. It is even more egregious to ask Californians to go through another round of closings when they are still suffering from previous rounds. Past BRAC rounds will continue to weigh heavily on my State because many bases from the 1995 closure round will not close until 1999 or after. Furthermore, some of these closures have not proven to be cost-efficient, and that is one reason why we are not seeing the savings that had been previously promised. 
I believe that we should not even consider future base closings until we have had the time to properly analyze the ramifications of the previous four rounds. We need to have solid data about the long-term costs and benefits of base closures. More importantly, we need to make sure that we understand the effect these closures have had on the real people whose lives drastically change when a base in their community is closed. 
That is why we should pass the Dorgan Amendment, of which I am a cosponsor. This amendment would require the Department of Defense to issue a report on the long-term costs and savings incurred from the previous rounds of base closings before future BRAC's could go forward. I simply can not see how we can entertain the idea of additional rounds of base closures without first having the benefit of solid data and hard numbers from previous BRAC's. 
Mr. President, Californians are amazingly resilient. They have overcome devastating floods, disastrous earthquakes and terrorizing floods. Our state has gone through a lot. But I promise that California will not suffer further economic damage from another round of base closings until I have exhausted every tool available to me as a Senator. I urge my colleagues to oppose a new round of base closures.

Mrs. BOXER. As the Senators are aware, the 401(k) has emerged as many baby boomers primary pension plan. 401(k)s now cover more than 22 million employees and invest more than $675 billion in pension assets. Many American workers now have more equity in their 401(k) plans than in their homes. 
Unfortunately, Federal law is currently less protective of 401(k)s than traditional defined-benefit pension plans. A company sponsoring a traditional plan is currently prohibited from investing more than 10 percent of its assets in company holdings, such as real property or company stock. This reasonable limitation, however, does not apply to 401(k) plans. 
The amendment I offered last night would extend this 10 percent limitation to 401(k) plans, enhancing pension security for millions of workers nationwide. 
I want to thank both the chairman and the ranking member of the Finance Committee for their assistance in clearing this important amendment. 
The amendment included a small change at the request of the Senator from Oklahoma. The provision requested by the Senator from Oklahoma would allow companies sponsoring 401(k) plans to require that 1 percent of an employee's contribution be invested in qualified employer securities.

Mrs. BOXER. As you know, the House-passed Tax Reconciliation Bill included a provision which would provide an enhanced tax deduction for corporate contributions of computer technology and equipment. This provision, authored by Congressman Randy Cunningham, is very similar to a bill Senator Chafee and I introduced earlier this year. Our bill, the Computer Donation Incentive Act of 1977, provides an incentive for companies to donate new and nearly new computers and software to elementary and secondary schools. 
The successful education of America's children is closely linked to the use of innovative educational technologies, particularly computer-based instruction and research. Unfortunately, however, far too many elementary and secondary school classrooms lack the computers they need to take advantage of these new educational technologies. I believe this provision will provide America's schools with the technological resources necessary to prepare both students and teachers for the technologically advanced society in which we now live. 
I know that the chairman and ranking member on the Committee on Finance would like to have included the House provision in the Senate tax reconciliation bill, but due to revenue considerations were unable to do so. I hope, however, that my friend from Delaware and my friend from New York would urge the adoption of this very important provision in conference.

Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, there is something that the chairman said that calls for a response. I am pleased to stand here today endorsing the Democratic leader's proposal. The way we should cut taxes in this country should be a fair way, it should be good for children, it should be good for working families, it should be good for small business, and that is what this proposal offers. 
I say to my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, in 1993, we had two ways to approach the issue of economic recovery: the Democratic way, which passed by one vote, I might say, and the Republican way, which failed. Here we stand being able to cut taxes for the American people because we were right, because the kind of economic policy we put into place in 1993 has worked. 
We have seen deficit reduction that has surpassed our imagination. We are down to $70 billion from a high of $290 billion when President Clinton took over as President. We have seen 11 million or 12 million new jobs created. We have seen an economic recovery finally hitting my State that is making this day possible. 
So I say to the American people, they ought to look at the two plans. Again, we have a Republican plan, and we have a Democratic plan. Many of us may wind up voting in the end for the Republican plan. We will vote for amendments to change it, and if they are not adopted, we may well do that. But I think the Democratic leader's plan is the fair way, and let me say why. 
Deloitte & Touche did an analysis of the Republican plan in the Senate, and in terms of hard, cold dollars--and they are a very incredible accounting firm, objective--they go through the taxes that would be owed under the Republican plan by a married couple with two children, one in college and one under the age of 18. What they come up with is that the household with an income of $20,000 will get a $375 break. The very highest break goes to people--listen to this--earning over $1 million a year. They would get $2,400 back. That surpasses the people in the entire middle class. They get more money if they earn $1 million back than any other part of this economic spectrum. 
So in fairness, the Democratic plan has got it. It changes that. It doesn't give the most to the most wealthy, to those who earn over $1 million. 
Second, children. My colleague talks about how children are going to be helped by the Republican plan, but in the Democratic plan, we help all the children. 
Under this particular plan, only 50 percent of the children in California, Mr. President, get help, because this child care credit is not refundable off your payroll taxes. What we have to understand in this Senate is that people pay more in income tax. They pay payroll taxes. We say you shouldn't be denied a child credit if you fall into that category. 
Mr. President, I want to help all the children. I want to help small business by gearing capital gains cuts to them. That is what we do on our side. 
Finally, I thank the chairman of the committee for helping me with the Computer Donations Act and the 401(k) protection plan that he has agreed to look at for us. I just want to say, it is a good moment for us because the economic recovery is so strong, we are in a position to give something back to the American people, and I am pleased about that. 
I yield to my colleague from Massachusetts and thank him for his generosity.

Mrs. BOXER. I thank the Senator. I also want to thank the Chairman for his support for a number of critical transportation projects in California and in particular, the Alameda Transportation Corridor project. As the Chairman knows, he supported my efforts to designate the Corridor a High Priority Corridor in the National Highway System Designation Act of 1995. That in turn led President Clinton to include in his fiscal year 1997 budget request funding to support a $400 million direct Federal loan for the project, which was approved by Congress last year. 
As Senator Chafee, knows, California has major need for transportation investment due in large part to the tremendous increase in international trade flowing through the state. While this trade has helped bring California out of the economic recession earlier this decade, it has also placed tremendous strain on our infrastructure. No where is this more apparent than at our border with Mexico. Unfortunately, after the implementation of the North American Free Trade Agreement, the Federal Government provided no special assistance to the border States to deal with the expected doubling of commercial truck traffic through these border trade corridors. As the Senator knows from his recent tour of the area, narrow rural highways or city streets are being expected to carry heavy, continuous commercial truck traffic. 
In response to this need, I introduced the Border Infrastructure, Safety and Congestion Relief Act. A section of my bill would provide Federal funds to state infrastructure banks or authorities to finance border improvement projects. We know that some projects could be financed more efficiently under partnerships with the private sector. I understand Senator Chafee's bill on Transportation Finance and Innovation would provide an infusion of Federal credit assistance over the next six years to help construct large, high-cost infrastructure facilities. My question for the Chairman is this, would border crossing facilities and trade corridors be eligible for this type of Federal financing under your bill?

Mrs. BOXER. Thank you very much, Mr. President. I support the Senator from Illinois in his attempt to keep the age of Medicare eligibility at 65. 
Mr. President, raising the eligibility age to 67 in the future is part of the bill that is before us and was an amendment offered by the Senator from Texas, Senator Gramm. 
Now, had the Senator from Texas and his supporters had an alternative in place for those who would be unable in the future to get Medicare between the ages of 65 and 67--if there was an alternative in place, if this bill said that we will, in fact, raise that age, but only after we have an alternative in place for those people, I would be here supporting it. 
But it is so reckless, Mr. President, to take away Medicare from people who pay for it their entire working lives--to take it away from them for 2 years unless there is an alternative in place. I do not know if any of my colleagues know about our health insurance, but we have a pretty good plan around here. As a matter of fact, I voted in during the health care debate to offer that plan to every American. That didn't fly. `Oh, we are covered. What do we have to worry about? We are fine.' But to take away Medicare from people who have been paying for it out into the future without any way to replace it, I don't know what we are doing here. 
The Senator from Texas says he is concerned about the solvency of Medicare. That is what the Senator from Rhode Island said--if we care about solvency, we will support this. We all know there are many ways to address solvency. 
By the way, the committee does it in some other areas that I support, but not this one. 
My friends, it isn't that tricky to preserve the solvency of Medicare. If you want to really preserve the solvency, raise the eligibility age to 90, and for the people who are on Medicare at 90--there will be enough money to take care of them because everyone else who would have been eligible previously, will have died. 
Medicare solvency is the new mantra of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle. First they want to vote against Medicare --now they say they are going to save it. They are going to make it solvent by telling people that in the future without any alternative means of health insurance in place, no universal health care, that they have to wait until they are 67 to be eligible for Medicare. 
Medicare remains solvent because they don't talk about what happens to you when you can't get insurance and you don't get preventive care and you get sicker. What are people going to do? Either they have to go out and find it in the marketplace and pay thousands and thousands of dollars to get coverage, or they will fall down on their hands and knees and pray to God that they don't get sick. 
That is not an option because, unfortunately, if you look at the tables and you see when Alzheimer's strikes, when Parkinson's strikes, when stroke strikes, when heart disease strikes, when prostate cancer strikes, and even when breast cancer strikes, the older you get the more you are apt to get these conditions. You cannot control it. 
The Senator from Rhode Island said we have to save Medicare. What about saving the people who are served by Medicare? 
So this part of the Finance Committee bill puts the cart before the horse. Don't just say we are going to raise the age at which people can get Medicare and have nothing in its stead and not even make it contingent on having universal health care in place because when people reach the age of 65 they will not have an option. 
Mr. President, we ought to look at what we are doing around here. It sounds great, `save Medicare.' I think we need to save the people who rely on Medicare. 
We all know the horror stories of people getting sick. They don't expect it. And then they try to tie it to the increased age of Social Security retirement which we phased in, which I support--phasing it in. But there is one difference. People can still retire at age 62. If they choose to retire at that age and go on Social Security, there is a penalty but it can be done. There is no such provision in here. This is just a cutoff. The proposal does not say if you need Medicare you can get half coverage; you can pay 50 percent of your premium. No. This just takes people off the plan without any alternative--at a time in their life when they are apt to get seriously sick. If you have ever been in a hospital and you see some of these charges that come back at you, thousands of dollars a day, we will put people into ruin. We will go back to the days when people have to in fact rely on their children taking care of them at the height of their lives when they 
need Medicare and they cannot get it. 
So, Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support the Senator from Illinois. I want to save Medicare because I believe in it. I do not want to hurt the people who need Medicare. When you have something in place for those people to go to, when you have an alternative insurance plan, I'll am with you all the way. I will support you 100 percent. 
We already have 40 million people who are uninsured in this country. They have no health insurance. You are going to throw 7 million more of these people onto the uninsured rolls, and you are going to do it in the name of saving Medicare. 
Something is wrong with this picture. It doesn't add up. My friend from Illinois calls it the `Texas two-step.' I think it is the `backward step.' It is going back--back to the days when our senior citizens were very sick with no place to go. 
I hope you will support the motion by the Senator from Illinois. 
I yield the floor.  
Mr. KERREY addressed the Chair.

Mrs. BOXER. Is the Senator aware that there are 40 million uninsured Americans today and about 7 million in this category age 65 to 67? So the Senator is so right. We are talking about adding millions more to the uninsured rolls. This committee did nothing, mentioned nothing about any kind of way to get people through this timeframe. They just took it out without even writing anything in there that said only if we have replacement insurance.

Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I thank my colleague for yielding. People are living longer, so what are we doing about that? We are punishing them in the committee bill, saying, `You're living longer, therefore, you have to wait until you are 67 to get onto Medicare.' 
I say to my colleagues, why do you think people are living longer? Because we have Medicare. In the old days, we didn't have it and people got very, very sick. Take a look at Russia. The average man there lives to 58 because they have no access to health care. People are living longer because they go to a doctor early, they don't wait for a crisis. They get preventive care, and what this bill does is say, `American people, you're living too long, we're going to have to send this back.' Do we want to go back to when people died at 58 and 60? Then you will really have a strong Medicare Program because no one will be able to use it. Thank you, I yield the floor.

Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I want to associate myself with the remarks of my colleague from Texas, Senator Hutchison, who I thought really homed in on why this issue is so important. I am very pleased the distinguished chairman of the committee is here because it gives us an opportunity to speak with him about why we are so frustrated about this bill as it now stands. 
Mr. President, it would be a historic moment if this bill were to pass because it would, for the first time ever, overturn a BRAC decision. Now, we all know that when the four base closure rounds went through Washington, DC, many of us were not happy with the process. Many of us felt the savings were overstated. Many of us felt this was not the right way to go. But not one of us, until today, moved to undermine a BRAC decision. 
By objecting to this bill, we are taking a stand, it seems to me, for the integrity of the process. After all, this is the law of the land. This is just the kind of unraveling we do not want to see happen, because if this effort succeeds to overturn BRAC, to stifle competition between the private sector and the public sector with respect to depot maintenance, where will it end? Tomorrow, someone else will try another unraveling, and the day after, someone else will, and we will have chaos. 
I want to say, Mr. President, there are two other reasons why this bill as drafted is so harmful. Not only does it unravel the Base Closure Commission's decisions of the past but it undermines a promise made to the people in the Sacramento area and the people in Texas who will be so adversely affected. There was an explicit promise by the President of the United States that privatization in place could take place at McClellan Air Force Base. There was also a promise made by Congress that such privatization in place could move forward at McClellan. After all, Congress passed the BRAC, so, therefore, we would be breaking a deal, a sacred deal, really, made with these people who were told that privatization in place could, in fact, occur. 
Lastly, Mr. President, I thought we were all really concerned here about taxpayer dollars. We are doing everything we can to bring down this deficit. I am so proud to be a part of the team that brought down the deficit from $290 billion in 1993 to less than $70 billion now. We have agreed on a balanced budget deal to finish the job. This is great for taxpayers. This is good for our country. It is good for our economy. So why would we now reverse course and to say that the private sector's ability to compete with the public sector will be cut short? 
It will be a bad deal for the taxpayers if we do not reach some kind of agreement here. I hope we do because if the bill as drafted becomes the law of the land, it will force the Pentagon to waste money. This bill will essentially direct the Pentagon to waste money by preventing the fair and open competition that is underway to win contracts for depot maintenance work at Kelly and McClellan Air Force Bases. 
So every way you look at it--from standing behind the law of the land, the BRAC process, to keeping our word to workers who trusted us when we said privatization in place can take place, to taxpayers who know that it makes no sense to eliminate competition--if you look at all of these factors, Mr. President, I think what the Senators from Texas and the Senators from California are doing here is in the best interests of the U.S. Senate, of the U.S. Congress, and, frankly, in the best interests of the United States of America. 
I am working with the senior Senator from California, Senator Feinstein, who you will hear from shortly, my colleagues from Texas, and hopefully all others who want to see this bill move forward. We have no interest in preventing this bill from moving forward. We want to reach an accommodation here. I think there are ways we can do it. 
We are so sure that competition is a good thing, we are so positive that privatization in place will reap rewards for 
taxpayers, that we are willing--we are very willing--to agree to language that would ensure that this could only occur if the taxpayers save money. 
I am very hopeful that we can reach an agreement. Until then, we will fight for our rights as Senators to protect a promise made to the people of our communities and a promise made to the taxpayers. 
I yield the floor.

Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce legislation that would provide the U.S. Department of Agriculture [USDA] the authority to sell much needed land to a local school district in my State of California. 
This legislation will grant the USDA the authority to sell 22 acres of land in Dos Palos, CA to either a non-profit group or the Dos Palos School District. The transfer would be based upon an established fair market value of the land, determined by the USDA. 
The local community will reap many benefits from this legislation. The school district plans to use the land to establish a farm school to educate and train students and beginning farmers. Under the district's farm school proposal, high school and middle school students will actually farm the land in order to learn all aspects of modern agriculture practices--including irrigation and conservation methods, integrated pest management, agricultural marketing and administration. In addition, the proceeds from the farm school will enable the students to purchase their own equipment and supplies for use at the site. Implementation of this proposal ensures that the land remain in agricultural use for years to come. 
This legislation enjoys bi-partisan support, and companion legislation has been introduced by Congressman Gary A. Condit in the House. The local school district, the community of Dos Palos, CA, and the USDA have also expressed their support. During the 104th Congress the legislation received expedited review by the House Agriculture Committee, and passed the House by voice vote. Unfortunately, the Senate failed to pass this legislation before adjournment even though there was no known opposition from the leadership or the Senate Agriculture Committee.

Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce legislation that would allow the Hoopa Valley Tribe to obtain lands of deep cultural and historical significance. 
The Hoopa Valley Tribe has resided in Hoopa Valley, beginning at the mouth of the Trinity River Canyon in Humboldt County, for 10,000 years. In the 1950s, a settlement agreement between the Hoopa Valley Tribe and the U.S. Government designated a 12-by-12 mile area for the Hoopa Valley Reservation. When this land was surveyed and demarcated, a `dog-leg' was created along the southern boundary which omitted certain lands the tribe has deemed culturally and religiously significant. 
My legislation will remedy this situation by transferring 2,641 acres of the Six Rivers National Forest to the Hoopa Valley Tribe. I join the U.S. Forest Service in commending the Hoopa Valley Tribe for its history of natural resource management and expertise. This legislation enjoys broad bipartisan support in California and in the House, where it was sponsored by Congressman Frank D. Riggs. 
During the 104th Congress, the House version of this legislation was unanimously approved. Unfortunately, despite approval from the administration and the Senate Indian Affairs Committee, the legislation was never brought before the full Senate for a vote. I encourage my colleagues to act quickly to provide the Hoopa Valley Tribe with lands necessary to maintain their cultural and religious heritage.

Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce legislation that would change the name of the Clair Engle Lake in northern California to its commonly known name, Trinity Lake. 
Clair Engle Lake is the largest body of recreational water in Trinity County. Every year, thousands of recreational users from all over California come to the lake to fish, boat, hike, and camp. 
Since the reservoir was created by the building of the Trinity Dam, local citizens have referred to the lake as Trinity Lake. This usage has been widely adopted by almost all of the general public as well as by Federal, State, and local officials. In fact, this widespread usage of a name other than the official name has become the cause of confusion for visitors and tourists, and has had a negative economic impact on the lake community. 
My legislation would end this confusion by renaming the lake to Trinity Lake. My legislation is supported by the Trinity County Board of Supervisors as well as the Bureau of Reclamation. I also am pleased to be working with Representative Wally Herger who has introduced similar legislation in the House of Representatives.

Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today, I introduce the Prostate Testing Full Information Act. In a series of town meetings in my State of California, I brought together the top prostate cancer experts in the State, the head of the urology branch at the National Cancer Institute, and prostate cancer survivors to discuss what can be done to aid in the fight against this disease. 
The statistics on prostate cancer are alarming. Based on current U.S. rates, about 19 of every 100 men born today will be diagnosed with prostate cancer during their lifetime, while approximately 4 of every 100 men will die from the disease. Between 1973 and 1993, the rate of new cases of prostate cancer rose by 173 percent. During 1997, approximately 370,000 new cases will be diagnosed and more than 40,000 men will die of prostate cancer. 
This bill will require physicians, at the time they perform a prostate examination on men over the age of 50, to inform the patient of the availability of the prostate specific antigen [PSA] test and other appropriate diagnostic procedures. 
In addition, the bill increases prostate cancer research funding at the National Institutes of Health and the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research. 
I urge my colleagues to join me in cosponsoring this important legislation.

Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the After School Education and Safety Act of 1997. This bill creates after school enrichment programs for kindergarten, elementary, and secondary school-aged students. Today's youth face far greater social risks than did their parents and grandparents. According to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, youth between the ages of 12 and 17 are most at risk of committing violent acts and being victims of violent crimes between 3 p.m. and 6 p.m: a time when they are not in school. 
My bill will help schools expand their capacity to address the needs of school-aged children between these critical hours. Since juvenile crime peeks at the close of the schoolday--we need to give children a safe and supervised place where they can use those hours to their best advantage. Education is a key component of success. This bill seeks to increase the academic success of students while working to improve their intellectual, social, physical, and cultural skills. For older students, programs will be available to prepare them for work force participation. 
Schools receiving grants under the act must provide at least two of the following programs: Mentoring, academic assistance, recreational activities, or technology training. It is critical that we work with our Nation's children during their school years to create strong foundations in academics, technology, and other fields which will carry them into adulthood. 
Schools will be able to work within their communities to design programs that meet the needs of the area. Activities authorized by the bill are to take place in a school building or another public facility designated by the school. 
Mr. President, the best investment we can make in this country is in our children. I urge my colleagues to review this legislation and join me in making after school a safe time for our Nation's children.

Mrs. BOXER. I thank the Chair. I thank the Senator from West Virginia for his leadership on all of this, and the chairman of the committee. This is his first time as chairman bringing a bill to the floor. I know that both sides have worked very, very hard. 
Mr. President, this is a good news-bad news day for the people in North Dakota and for the people in the 21 other States who are waiting to see this Congress finally pass an emergency bill and send it to the President. It is a good news day because the bill is before us. 
As has been said many times, and I repeat it again, for both sides, from the chairman, Senator Stevens, to the ranking member, Senator Byrd, to their staffs, to all of the members of the Appropriations Committee, of which I am a new member, I cannot tell you how grateful we from California are for the patience and understanding and the work that went into this bill, for the things we have in this bill to help our people. We have had devastating floods, and we have many things to do to pick up the pieces for the people who were hit hard, for the people who have to replant orchards, for the people who depend on Yosemite National Park and the tourism that it brings to give them livelihood and sustenance. 
Those funds are in this bill, and they do not come from FEMA, I say to my colleagues. And, as my friend, Senator Conrad from North Dakota, said, they are not in the pipeline. These funds must come through the pipeline, and until this bill passes they will not be there because they are from agriculture, they are from the highway fund, they are from the Army Corps of Engineers, and they are from housing. 
So the funds that are in the pipeline--and I think it is important we all understand this--are the FEMA funds. By the way, if we have another tragedy in our country--we never know when disaster strikes--even that could be jeopardized. I watched with horror the tornado that hit Texas, and I thought to myself here we are on a break and another natural disaster hits. I hope FEMA does have the wherewithal to meet that disaster. 
So, my friends, we are playing with fire. We are playing with flooding. We are playing with earthquakes. We are playing with disaster here. We need to be sure that the funds in this bill which have been put together in such a careful way get to the people who need them the most. 
I am glad my colleague from North Dakota showed the photographs again of the devastation because sometimes we have a short attention span and we forget, but when we see those buildings as they looked when they were in flames in the middle of a flood, it really did remind you of World War II pictures, of the worst kind of attack, and this was an attack from nature. 
We need to do what we can to make these people whole, to work with their private insurers, to work with communities, to work with local and State governments to do what we can do. It is a very basic question: What are we here for? Are we here to play political games? Are we here to win a political skirmish? Or are we here to help the people who so need that help? I hope that, after we get through today, because clearly we have these riders attached to this bill that have nothing to do whatsoever with the emergency, I hope when this bill comes back from the President, who has been forthright about the fact he will veto a bill with these riders, we will strip these controversial riders from the bill and move on. 
Mr. President, my people in California are waiting. They do not understand it. I went home, and they said, `Well, why, Senator, is this all taking so long?' I explained that there were three controversial riders placed on this bill that have nothing to do with the emergency. And one of them, the most controversial, undermines the budget agreement that we were all so proud to say we support. It is almost as if the majority is protecting the Senate from the majority. 
Why do I say that? Because there is no reason why we have to put this Government on automatic pilot. There is no reason why we cannot do our work and pass our appropriations bills. We do not need an automatic pilot budget process in place. If we had that in place, why do we need the Senate? We would not need it; we would just put everything on automatic pilot. The only people who can cause a shutdown are the people right here in this Senate. If we agree we are never going to shut down the Government, let us agree to do our work and pass our bills and compromise and move forward. 
I do not blame the President for being outraged on this. Here he holds a press conference; everyone is hugging everyone, Democrats and Republicans; they passed the budget. Everyone gave a little and everyone got a little. Now we have this automatic CR placed on an emergency bill, which, if it passes, will totally undermine that agreement there. There are harsh cuts in education and the environment. This does not belong on this bill. 
Here is the point. These riders should stand on their own two feet. They should come here as separate bills. We should debate 
them and vote them out. They should not be attached to legislation to help people who have been thrown off their feet by disasters. This is wrong. We do not have to do this. 
So, yes, it is a good news-bad news day for people in 22 States--good news because we are moving the supplemental, bad news because it has these extraneous matters attached that undermine the budget agreement and do other things and do not belong on this bill. The bill will be vetoed, and we will be back to square one. And people in the country will scratch their heads and wonder what on Earth are we doing. That is not a proud moment for this Senate. 
Mr. President, on an unrelated matter, I want to mention that something historic happened in California yesterday that does deal with another type of emergency, and that is the passage of junk gun laws. 
Let me tell my colleagues what happened in California yesterday. 
The California State Assembly and the California State Senate passed legislation to prohibit the manufacture and sale of junk guns in California, Saturday night specials. Those guns that have not one quality of safety standard are now banned from manufacture in the State of California, assuming the Governor signs this bill. 
Mr. President, we talk about emergencies; 40,000 people a year are killed by gunshots in this great Nation, almost 300,000 a year are wounded, and the criminal gun of choice is the Saturday night special, the junk gun, the only product in America today that has not one quality of safety standard. In 1968, those guns were outlawed from importation after Robert Kennedy was assassinated. I have to say there was a big loophole that allowed American companies to make these guns. I am proud that the State assembly and the senate passed this bill. It is modeled after my bill that I introduced last year and again this year. 
I hope that as we deal with emergencies and we look at the emergency of gun violence, we will recognize we have guns on the market today that are banned from importation because they are so poorly made, and at the minimum people deserve to have safety standards and quality standards on guns that they purchase. 
So, Mr. President, it is a great day for Californians. Even with the worst, heaviest type of heavyhanded lobbying, these bills passed, and I am very excited about it. I hope that we will have the courage to do the same in the Senate. I will give the Senate a chance to cast that courageous vote. 
I close, Mr. President, by again thanking my colleagues from Alaska and West Virginia for their assistance to the good people of California and the 21 other States, particularly the heart-rending photos we saw today that just reminded us of what happened in North Dakota. I thank them for working in a bipartisan fashion to get a bill to us that is an excellent bill, and I pray and I hope that we can get these extraneous riders stripped off of this bill so that the people in North Dakota and the people in the 21 other States can say this Senate did something to really help the people of America.

Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise to mark a historic day in the nationwide movement to get junk guns, or Saturday night specials, off our streets. The California State Assembly and the California Senate passed legislation to prohibit the manufacture and sale of junk guns in California. The bills require that all guns made or sold in California meet the same quality and safety test currently required of imported firearms. 
I applaud and thank each and every member of the California Legislature who voted for the bill for their courage in supporting this important legislation. I especially wish to acknowledge Assemblyman Louis Caldera and Senator Richard Polanco, whose leadership and tenacity contributed immeasurably to the passage of this legislation. 
The bills passed by the California Legislature are nearly identical to a bill I introduced in the Senate last spring, the American Handgun Standards Act, which I have reintroduced this year. For the largest State in the Union to pass this legislation is extraordinary. 
I trust that this important victory is just what we need here in Congress to move forward with junk gun legislation on the Federal level. Each year, nearly 40,000 Americans die from gunshots and more than 200,000 are injured. Gunshots are now the leading cause of death among children in California. 
I have spoken on this floor many times before about the junk gun double standard that has flooded our streets with cheap, unsafe, easily concealable handguns. In 1968, Congress required that all handguns imported to the United States meet a tough quality and safety test. This import restriction virtually cut off the flow of foreign junk guns. However Congress failed to require domestically produced handguns to meet the same test. This double standard led to the creation of a domestic junk gun industry that has flooded our streets with these unsafe, ultracheap handguns. 
Study after study has shown that these junk guns are the criminal's weapon of choice. 
California has taken the lead in a nationwide movement to get these guns off our streets. Thirty-two cities and counties have enacted local ordinances banning junk gun sales within their jurisdictions. Now that the California Legislature has taken this courageous step, I urge Governor Wilson to sign this historic legislation. 
Today, Californians who want an end to gun violence had a major victory, and the U.S. Senate should take notice. I hope that soon we will be able to pass the American Handgun Standards Act, which will make our children, our families, and our communities safer. 
There is no reason why American-made handguns should not have the same quality and safety standards as imported handguns. This dichotomy is killing our people.

Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Clean Fuel Vehicle Act of 1997 to provide a program of tax incentives and other changes to promote the use of clean fuel vehicles. I believe that, as a U.S. Senator, I have no greater responsibility than to support policies that will protect the health and safety of the American people. Today, I want to tell you why I believe that my bill, the Clean Fuel Vehicle Act, is an important part of meeting that responsibility. 
More than 43 million people in the United States live in areas that fail to meet EPA's air quality standards for carbon monoxide. We have 13 million people in nonattainment areas for nitrogen oxide. And, in my State of California, nearly 26 million people live in a nonattainment area for one or more pollutants, out of a state of nearly 32 million people. Air pollution is a very serious problem. According to the EPA, the current annual average concentrations of fine particulate matter in southeast Los Angeles County may be responsible for up to 3,000 deaths annually, and more then 52,000 incidences of respiratory symptoms including 1,000 hospital admissions. 
Young children constitute the largest group at high risk from exposure to air pollutants. They breathe 50 percent more air by body weight than the average adult. In California alone there are over 6 million children under the age of 14 and approximately 90 percent of them live in areas that fail to meet State and Federal standards. How are our children being affected? Studies show health effects ranging from 20 to 60 percent losses of lung capacity. 
So much of our air pollution problem comes from automobiles and other vehicles that burn fossil fuel. Sixty-five percent of carbon dioxide emissions and 47 percent of nitrogen oxide emissions come from cars and trucks. 
I believe we must reinvigorate--electrify if you will--our efforts for clean fuel vehicles. The role of the Federal Government should be to encourage the market for these vehicles for a limited period of time with tax incentives. 
The Clean Fuel Vehicle Act would make it easier for both individual car buyers and government purchasers of auto fleets to purchase clean fuel vehicles. In summary, the bill repeals the luxury excise tax on clean fuel vehicles--a $320 savings this year on a $40,000, factory-built electric vehicle, and repeals the luxury tax depreciation cap. It provides a full tax credit of $4,000 on the purchase of an electric vehicle. It allows companies which lease electric vehicles to government agencies to take advantage of the tax incentives and pass on the savings. It makes electric buses and other heavy duty electric vehicles eligible for the same tax deduction already in place for other clean fuel buses and heavy duty equipment. It lowers the excise tax on liquified natural gas--used in heavy vehicles such as tractor-trailer rigs and buses--to the gasoline gallon equivalent of compressed natural gas so that it can be competitive with diesel fuel. And, it sunsets all these tax incentives by January 1, 2005. 
According to estimates by the Joint Committee on Taxation, the bill would cost only about $22 million over 5 years. My bill is endorsed by the Union of Concerned Scientists, the Electric Transportation Coaltion, and the Natural Gas Vehicle/USA.

Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I would like to ask the distinguished ranking member of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Energy and Water Development, Senator Reid, and the distinguished ranking member of the Budget Committee, Senator Lautenberg, if they would respond to questions I have concerning funding for natural resource programs in the budget resolution for fiscal year 1998.

Mrs. BOXER. Let me first ask my friend and State neighbor, Senator Reid, to recall the provision in last year's omnibus appropriations bill, that authorized the California Bay-Delta Environmental Enhancement and Water Security Act. The Act authorizes Federal participation in the CALFED Bay-Delta Program, which is charged with developing a balanced, comprehensive and lasting plan to restore and enhance the ecological health and improve water management in the Bay-Delta system. This program is a top priority of the State of California and has support from business, environmental and water users throughout the State. I would like to ask Senator Reid, as the ranking member of the appropriations subcommittee with jurisdiction over this act, if he agrees with me that it is important to fund this program?

Senator Lautenberg, as one of the negotiators involved in this current budget agreement and as a member of the Budget Committee leadership, is it your view that the amounts provided under the Natural Resources function in this Budget Resolution are sufficient to accommodate the President's request of $143 million in fiscal year 1998 to implement the California Bay-Delta Environmental and Water Security Act?

Mrs. BOXER. I rise to support the Mack amendment which recognizes the importance of funds for the National Institutes of Health [NIH] research programs. 
The investment that the American public has made in medical research funded by the NIH has been the foundation of this Nation's medical research enterprise--one of the leading sectors of our economy. 
The NIH supports research at 2,000 colleges, universities, and other scientific institutions, including the efforts of more than 50,000 researchers and their staff throughout the country. 
An NIH appropriations increase of 100 percent over the next 5 fiscal years and a $2 billion increase by 1998 will save millions of lives. 
In 1991, NIH launched the Women's Health Initiative, a 15-year study to examine hormone replacement therapy and its impact on cardiovascular disease--the leading cause of death in the U.S.; dietary intervention in the prevention of breast and colonrectal cancer; and vitamin D and calcium in the prevention of osteoporosis and colonrectal cancer. 
Breast Cancer--the most commonly diagnosed cancer and the second leading cancer killer of American women--affects one in eight women in their lifetimes. Federal funding for breast cancer research and programs has continued to increase, but this year alone over 180,000 American women will be diagnosed with breast cancer. 
I want to see the death rate from more diseases drop. I want to see a commitment in research funds for ovarian cancer--the silent killer--about which there is so little known. 
I want to see eradication of diseases like Scleroderma, a disease most can't pronounce--but there are more cases of scleroderma than multiple sclerosis or muscular dystrophy. 
In the 25 years since the National Cancer Act was signed into law, the toll taken by cancer continues to rise. In 1996, over 1.5 million Americans were diagnosed with some form of cancer and over 550,000 people lost their lives to cancer. This year, the numbers will continue to climb. 
In 1997, approximately 131,920 Californians will be diagnosed as having cancer. This is the equivalent of almost 15 new cases every hour of every day. Approximately, 53,610 Californians will die from cancer. 
Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in American men and has become the most common cancer in California. (American Cancer Society, 1997 California Cancer Facts and Figures). Based on current U.S. rates, about 19 of every 100 men born today will be diagnosed with prostate cancer during their lifetime, while approximately 4 of every 100 men will die from this disease. 
In 1997, approximately 24,000 Californians will be diagnosed with prostate cancer and an estimated 3,500 deaths will occur. 
More funding for cancer research will make a difference. While there is no shortage of good research ideas in the cancer field overall, the chances for funding these research opportunities keeps getting worse. 
The overall percentage of approved but unfunded investigator-initiated grants steadily increased from 40 percent in the 1970's to 85 percent in 1995. This trend needs to be reversed. 
This amendment is a step in the right direction. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment and make sure that appropriate levels of funding are invested in research which saves lives.

Mrs. BOXER. I want to thank the chairman and the ranking member. I understand that after our brief conversation they will accept an amendment that Senator Durbin and I will be introducing tomorrow that has already been sent to the desk. 
Mr. President, because the economy is so strong and the Clinton budget plan in 1993 was so right, we can now finish the job of balancing the budget in a fair and responsible way. The plan before us, for the most part, I believe is fair and reasonable. No more destruction of Medicare and Medicaid, gone are the $270 billion cuts proposed by Republicans last year, gone are the $88 billion cuts they wanted to do to Medicaid, no more talk about doing away with the Department of Education, the Department of Commerce, no more suggestion that the Environmental Protection Agency should be stripped of its power and its funds. 
Now, I believe this radical revolution is over with this budget deal. Could this budget deal be better? Yes, of course, it could. One way, Mr. President, it could be better is if we kept our tax cuts moderate and targeted them to the middle-class. We could reach balance sooner. We would still have resources left to do more for our children and our communities. 
What Senator Durbin and I--and it is cosponsored by Senators Daschle, Harkin, and Bumpers--what we say in our amendment, and I am very pleased it will be accepted, is that a substantial majority of the tax cut benefits provided in the reconciliation bill will go to middle-class working families earning less than approximately $100,000 per year and that the tax cuts in the reconciliation bill will not cause revenue losses to increase significantly in the years after 2007. 
In other words, we have two points to our amendment. One is tax cut benefits go to the middle-class; and two, we do not want to see an explosion of deficits in the outyears. 
Mr. President, I am pleased that the chairman is accepting this. I am pleased we are walking down this path together. I really will watch this because we have no assurance that this amendment will be kept in the conference, but we will keep our eye on it because I suspect if we insisted on a vote we would get a near unanimous vote. 
I am hopeful we can keep this language in the bill itself. If it is stripped out, Mr. President, I will be back once we get to the reconciliation bill, to make sure that tax cuts are not going to the people who are earning $1 million but are, in fact, going to our hard-working families who earn approximately $100,000 a year. 
Thank you very much, Mr. President. Again, my thanks to the Members of the Budget Committee. This has been a long time in coming. It is not the perfect budget but I think it puts an end to the radical revolution that was threatened a couple years ago and it will bring us to balance. It is good for our children, and overall I am pleased with it. 
I yield the floor.

Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, throughout this debate we have heard both sides accuse each other of misstatement and worse. We have heard charges and countercharges. Today, as we close down this argument, I am not going to engage in any of those charges and countercharges. I am going to talk about what both sides know to be fact. 
Fact: This Santorum bill will outlaw a procedure known as an intact dilation and extraction. 
Fact: This procedure is used by obstetricians and gynecologists in circumstances where they believe it is in the best interests of the woman, to save her life or to save her health. 
Fact: Those very same physicians who use this procedure oppose this bill. The American College of Gynecologists and Obstetricians confirmed today that they oppose this bill. 
Fact: This bill is opposed by the California Medical Association. 
Fact: This bill is opposed by the American Medical Women's Association, an organization of women physicians. 
Fact: This bill is opposed by the American Nurses Association. 
Fact: This bill is opposed by the Society of Physicians for Reproductive Health. 
Fact: The American Medical Association endorsed this bill in a 4-day reversal of opinion. Having done that, they have taken a position against the very doctors who handle these procedures. 
Fact: We have a series of women who have come forward to testify, about their pain, their grief, that this procedure--that would be outlawed in the pending Santorum bill saved their lives and their health, retained their fertility in many cases, and in the opinion of their doctors was the humane procedure to use for all concerned. 
Fact: Most of these women, whose photographs I have behind me, most of these women who came forward to share their stories are very religious, and many say they are opposed to all abortions, but they decided after all the facts were on the table and after consulting their families and many doctors--many went to several doctors, in many cases five or six, to try and come up with another solution to a tragedy--they decided this was their only choice after they consulted with these many doctors, with their families, with their clergy, and with their God. 
Several went on to have healthy pregnancies. Coreen Costello was among them. You can see little Tucker in this photograph, who was born after Coreen underwent the procedure. 
I will quote from some of the letters we have received from doctors organizations against the Santorum bill.

Mrs. BOXER. The American Medical Women's Association says, in part, in a letter to Senator Santorum, `On behalf of the American Medical Women's Association, I would like to reiterate our opposition to H.R. 1122.' This letter is dated today. 
The organization does not endorse legislation which interferes with medical decisionmaking, particularly when it fails to consider the health of the woman patient. 
Our opposition is based on the following issues. First, we are gravely concerned that this legislation does not protect a woman's physical and mental health, including future fertility, or consider other pertinent issues such as fetal abnormalities. Second, this legislation would further erode physician-patient autonomy forcing physicians to always avoid legislatively prohibited procedures in medical decisionmaking, including in emergency situations when physicians and patients must base their decisions on the best available information * * * 
That is the American Medical Women's Association letter, in part. 
The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, after learning of the opposition of the AMA, wrote a letter to Senator Lott dated yesterday. 
In light of the slight modifications being proposed to H.R. 1122, we wanted to take this opportunity to reiterate our opposition to this legislation. 
They attach their statement in which they say: 
Terminating a pregnancy is performed in such circumstances to save the life or preserve the health of the mother. Intact D&X is one of the methods available in some of these situations * * * and only the doctor, in consultation with the patient, based upon the woman's particular circumstances can make this decision. 
Is it not interesting, an organization of obstetricians and gynecologists oppose this bill and have to plead the case that they are the ones who should make this decision--not Senator Santorum, not Senator Boxer, not Senator Coats, not Senator Feinstein, not Senator Helms. This is not our job. Our job is tough enough. We do not come close to being doctors. We have one physician in this body, but he is not an obstetrician and gynecologist. 
A letter dated today from the American Nurses Association: 
I am writing to reiterate the opposition of the American Nurses Association to H.R. 1122 * * * 
It is the view of the American Nurses Association that this proposal would involve an inappropriate intrusion of the federal Government into a therapeutic decision that should be left in the hands of a pregnant woman and her health-care provider * * * 
The American Nurses Association is the only full-service professional organization representing the Nation's 2.2 million registered nurses throughout its 53 constituent associations. 
Now I want to tell you some of the real life stories that have been presented to us by some of the women who have undergone the procedure that this bill would ban. Many have heard these stories before, but they are worth repeating because not every woman who has had this procedure has come forward. These stories are representative of those women. 
I talked to you about Coreen Costello pictured here with her newborn son, Tucker. She was able to have Tucker because it saved her fertility to undergo the procedure that is banned in the Santorum bill. She is a registered Republican, describes herself as very religious. She is clear that she and her family do not believe in abortion. When she was pregnant, she was rushed to the emergency room because her baby was having seizures, and found out something was seriously wrong with her baby. 
She named the baby Katherine Grace. This is a woman and family who wanted that child desperately. And to hear women like this referred to as women who kill their babies to me is an absolute disgrace. 
The baby had not been able to move for months--not her eyelids, tongue, nor her lips. Her chest cavity was unable to rise and fall for air, and her lungs and chest were left severely undeveloped almost to the point of nonexisting. Her vital organs were atrophied. The doctor told Coreen and her husband that the baby would not survive, and they recommended terminating the pregnancy. To Coreen and to Jim, this was not an option. Coreen wanted to go into labor naturally. She wanted her baby born on God's time and did not want to interfere. The family spent 2 weeks going from expert to expert. 
Again, I have heard my colleagues on more than one occasion demean these women, saying, `Well, if only they had checked, they would have found another option.' There are always other options, say my colleagues who don't know anything about medicine. 
Coreen and her family were told they couldn't consider inducing labor. They considered a caesarean section. But the doctors were adamant that the risks to her health and her life were too great. 
Then Coreen finally said, `There was no reason to risk leaving my two children motherless if there was no hope of saving Katherine Grace.' 
My colleagues, women like Coreen Costello deserve our love and deserve our support. They don't deserve the kind of treatment they would get if this bill becomes law. They have come forward. They were saved. But they are coming forward to spare other families the tragedy they went through. 
Coreen writes to us, `The birth of Tucker would not have been possible without this procedure. Please give other women and their families this chance. 
`Let us deal with our tragedies without any unnecessary interference from our Government. Leave us with our God. Leave us with our families and our trusted medical experts.' 
I could go on. I will show you a picture of Vikki Stella, a mother of two. She went through a very similar case. She tried in every way to save her baby, but was told that her life was at risk if she didn't use this procedure. The surgery preserved her fertility. 
Here she is shown with her son Nicholas. She calls him our darling son, Nicholas, who was born in 1995. This was after she had undergone the procedure that the Santorum bill seeks to outlaw. 
So the procedure saved Vikki's life. It preserved her family. Vikki's situation was heart-wrenching. 
Mothers and fathers need to be able to make medical decisions like that with their God and with their doctors, not with Senators. We don't belong in that room. 
We have offered alternatives, alternatives that go to the heart of another matter, which is the decision Roe v. Wade that is the law of the land, which basically says in the early stages of a pregnancy a woman has the right to choose and the State does not have a right to interfere. But after viability, Roe says the State does have a right to interfere. And I agree with that. 
Senator Feinstein and I offered an alternative that would have said no abortion after viability. But we make two exceptions, consistent with compassion, consistent with caring, consistent with Roe and the Court cases. We say no abortion after viability except to preserve the life of the mother or to spare her serious adverse health consequences. 
My colleagues on the other side have said, `Senator Boxer and Senator Feinstein believe in abortion on demand.' They have misstated our position day in and day out. What we are saying is there should be absolutely no abortion after viability except to save the life and the health of the woman. That is the option that would be endorsed, I think, by the majority of the American people. The bill that is before us doesn't do anything about late-term abortion. It deals with one procedure, a procedure that in fact doctors say is necessary to save the life and the health of a woman. 
I would like to read parts of an opinion piece that appeared in the Los Angeles Times written by Ellen Goodman.

Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, Ellen Goodman writes: 
The Senate debate has not really been about banning an abortion method. It's been about permitting exception to that ban. Senators led by Pennsylvania's Rick Santorum have refused to allow an exception even to protect the woman from serious harm to her health. * * * 
Is it up to Congress to overrule the doctor? To overrule the `selfish' woman defending her health? 
The bill is not really about banning a procedure. If dilation and extraction is the first method banned, without exception it won't be the last. The goals of abortion opponents are unequivocal. And, indeed, in, I thought, a good debate that the Senator from Pennsylvania and I had on Sunday, I think he was very straightforward about that. The Senators who have been speaking on the other side of the aisle on this subject all would tell you they are against all abortions from the first moment of a pregnancy. 
Ellen Goodman writes: 
We already have compromises. The Supreme Court decisions weigh the interests of the woman with those of the developing fetus. The law allows states to severely limit abortion after viability. But at no point does it give the government the right to seriously damage a woman's health to protect a fetus. 
This is at the primal heart of the matter. 
She concludes: 
No Congress can be allowed to legislate a new flock of sacrificial women. 
What does she mean, sacrificial women? That is, women who will be sacrificed because of politics, because of laws that are made right here. And when abortion was illegal, women died. 
There are those of us who will stand here as long as it takes to make sure we don't go back to those dark days. This bill should not be about politics, though, sadly, it might turn out to be. This bill should not be about 30-second misleading commercials, though, sadly, it might turn out to be. This bill should not be about fear, fear of doing the right thing, though, sadly, it might turn out to be. 
What this should be about is at least the basic bottom line that we should keep in mind when we pass any legislation. And that bottom line should always be do no harm. Do no harm. Yet, we are told by physicians that this bill does harm. It has no exception for physicians who believe the banned procedure is in the best interests of the woman for her very survival and for her very health. 
My colleagues, please do not relegate women to a status that says their life and their health do not matter. Please look inside your hearts. Ask yourself how you would feel if your daughter was told that the safest procedure in a pregnancy turned tragically wrong was an intact D&E, and, yet, the doctor fearing jail refused to use it. Look in your heart. Think about how you would feel. You would drop to your knees. You would pray to God that the doctor could use the option that was safe, that would save the life and the health of your daughter. And then, if this bill was the law, you would go to court to defend that doctor. But the rules would be stacked against him or her. 
Just read this bill. 
My colleagues, that is the wrong way to go. These women have been saved because this Congress didn't outlaw the procedure that was necessary to save their lives and their health. 
There will be other women who look like this, who have families like this, who might be, as Ellen Goodman said, sacrificed because of politics. I say that we should save these women who are relying on us to protect them. 
This isn't about them versus their babies. They wanted their babies. They desperately wanted their babies. But in circumstances that no one seemed able to predict, in rare circumstances, in tragic circumstances, they needed an intact D&E. 
We are not doctors--not even close. Every speaker I have heard--I may be wrong on this--on the side of the Santorum bill 
has been a man. Again, I may be wrong on this. But I am 99 percent sure that every one of them would support outlawing all abortions. They do not know what it is like to find yourself in a desperate situation as a woman--as a woman. Situations like Vikki's or Coreen's or Eileen's, or any of the women who were told they needed an intact D&E to save their lives or their health. 
Mr. President, I have a letter dated today from these women I have been talking about. They have listened to this debate. This is what they say: 
Please don't forget us, and the stories that brought us to Washington to meet with so many of you over the last two years. We are just a sampling of the women and families who have had very wanted pregnancies go wrong, and whose doctors have wept with us as they explained the options that could help us maintain our health and our fertility. We know the truth about the so-called `partial-birth abortions' that you debate in Washington, because we needed the surgery that doctors call intact dilation and evacuation. * * * 
The AMA endorsement of this legislation, and the superficial changes added today do not change the fact that this ban still contains no provision to protect the health of women like us.

 Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise today to welcome Jose Ramos-Horta to California. In recognition of his indefatigable efforts on behalf of the people of his native East Timor, Mr. Ramos-Horta was coawarded the 1996 Nobel Prize for Peace. He will be in San Francisco in June to participate in a 3-day conference on peacemaking. There he will be joined by numerous national and world leaders including fellow Nobel laureates, the Dalai Lama of Tibet and Rigoberta Menchu of Guatemala. 
The issue of East Timor has a special relevance in California, which is home to the largest concentration of Portuguese-Americans in the United States. Shortly after Portugal took steps in 1974 to end political oppression at home, it withdrew from most of its foreign territories, including East Timor. Although Portugal ceased to exercise colonial influence over East Timor in the midseventies, it has remained an important voice of conscience regarding East Timor ever since. 
As may be expected at the conclusion of 500 years of foreign rule, a brief period of struggle ensued between rival factions in East Timor. For many, the pain of this civil strife was tempered with optimism over the prospect of imminent, peaceful self-rule. Exiled by colonialist authorities for his early proindependence stance, Mr. Horta was particularly encouraged by events. 
This hope of a budding nation was crushed when troops from neighboring Indonesia invaded East Timor in 1975. Annexation followed the next year and so began a period of often brutal occupation. Regrettably, over 20 years later, for many East Timorese the dream of political independence has been replaced, at least in the short term, by the struggle for the most basic of human rights. 
In self-imposed exile since the invasion, Jose Ramos-Horta has never forgotten his homeland and its desire for peace and freedom. He travels, writes, and speaks continually about what has occurred and what is occurring in East Timor. It is testament to his passion and the resilience of his countrymen that the troubles of this small island no longer fester in obscurity. 
Jose Ramos-Horta is the latest in a distinguished succession of modern leaders who have sacrificed and continue to sacrifice much for the causes of peace and justice. I know I join many of my colleagues and millions of others when I say that it is my hope that, like Nelson Mandela, Lech Walesa, and Andrei Sakharov, Mr. Ramos-Horta's crusade meets with rapid success and spurs further advances in human rights across Asia and the world. 
He and his words of peace and dignity are always welcome in California.

 Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I wish to extend my most sincere congratulations to Deputy Jason Hendrix of the San Bernardino County Sheriff's Department on being honored today by the American Police Hall of Fame as its `1997 Law Enforcement Officer of the Year.' We are extremely fortunate to have an officer of Deputy Hendrix's caliber and commitment, and I commend him for the outstanding act of bravery that resulted in receipt of this award. 
While off duty in March of last year, Deputy Hendrix observed an armed man holding two employees hostage in front of a crowded store. After sending his fiancee to dial 911, Hendrix startled the suspect and promptly secured the release of the hostages. An exchange of gunfire followed, in which Deputy Hendrix disabled the suspect and was himself shot six times. The subject was subdued by another off duty officer and store employees. 
Few of us can appreciate the perils faced daily by the men and women of law enforcement. Each year dozens of peace officers are killed in the line of duty. I am thankful that Deputy Hendrix survived this confrontation, and I know that his family, friends, and colleagues are grateful for his recovery. 
I commend the selflessness and courage exhibited by Deputy Jason Hendrix on March 30, 1996. His act of valor almost certainly saved the lives of many innocent bystanders. His disregard for his own personal safety in defense of others represents the very best spirit of law enforcement. It is fitting that on this occasion, National Peace Officers Memorial Day, we thank Deputy Hendrix and all California police officers who regularly take risks and make sacrifices in service to their communities.

Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, let me say how proud I am to stand with my colleague, my senior Senator from California, Senator Feinstein, and the senior Senator from Illinois, Senator Carol Moseley-Braun, who has just arrived on the floor, to speak in favor of the bill which really addresses an issue that the American people want addressed. 
It does so in a way that is constitutional. It does so in a way that is respectful of women and their families. 
When we approach this issue, we have very strong feelings in the approach that is taken, in a sensitive way. 
It is harmful legislation. It will harm women, will hurt women, will lead to women dying, will lead to women suffering infertility, suffering paralysis, and all needlessly. 
So what we have done in this legislation, which I am very proud of, is to basically codify Roe versus Wade. In other words, we support a woman's right to choose with the understanding that after viability, when the fetus can live outside the womb with or without life support, we want to be very careful that there should be no abortion at all unless the woman's life is threatened, or her health is threatened, and in those cases where a doctor so determines and the woman's family so agrees, that that woman will be able to terminate that pregnancy in a way that protects her life and her health. 
What we are attempting to do in the course of this debate is to put a woman's face back on this issue because, when you listen to the other side, the woman is completely forgotten. As I said yesterday, the day we pass legislation that harms more than half of our population is the day that I wonder what we are doing as a country. 
I hope that the other side on this issue would join hands with us and get this passed. We know the President would sign this bill. Then we can tell the American people together that the only cases of late-term abortion in this Nation that would be allowed is when the woman faces a life-threatening situation, if the pregnancy continues, or one that is so serious that action must be taken to terminate the pregnancy. 
Senator Santorum would outlaw a particular procedure and not allow it be used except in the most narrow circumstance. 
I want to tell you what some doctors have said about this procedure that Senator Santorum would ban. 
The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists is an organization representing 37,000 physicians. As I have said in the past, I know those of us who come to the U.S. Senate are pretty strong people who believe in our views, who believe in ourselves, but we ought to leave our egos at the door when it comes to protecting lives. 
When it comes to medical emergencies, we do not have the capability of deciding what procedure ought to be used in a hospital room. If you were to ask your constituents, I don't care what party, or whether they are Independent, Republican, Democratic, or whatever party they are for, who would you rather have in the emergency room with you, Senator Santorum, Senator Boxer, or the family doctor who is trained, who understands the issue? I think they would say, `I don't want any politicians in the hospital room with me. I want the best physician that I can find for my wife or for my daughter or for my niece. And I want that doctor to have the full range of options,' knowing that there will never be an abortion in the late term unless the life or health of the mother is at stake. 
That is a pretty moderate course, it seems to me, a pretty reasonable course. And that is the course of the Feinstein-Boxer-Moseley-Braun bill. 
Let me repeat, under our bill, there will be no late-term abortion, no post-viability abortion unless the doctor determines that to protect the woman's life and health he or she must terminate the pregnancy. 
Senator Feinstein talked about Viki Wilson. I have her picture up here behind me with her loving family. And I think it is worth repeating the story. 
In her 36th week of the pregnancy, the nursery was ready, the family was anticipating the arrival of their new family member. Viki's doctor ordered an ultrasound which detected something that all of her prenatal testing had failed to detect. As Senator Feinstein told you, two-thirds of her daughter's brain had formed 
outside the skull, and the doctors feared that Viki's uterus would rupture in the birthing process leaving Viki sterile. After consulting with other physicians, with their clergy, with their God, in order to preserve Viki's fertility, they made the painful choice to have this procedure that would be outlawed under the Santorum bill. 
Now you see Viki, who has protected her fertility, a decision made with her doctor and her God. This procedure would be outlawed by the Santorum bill. 
The 37,000 gynecologists and obstetricians stated that this procedure that would be outlawed under the Santorum bill `may be the best or most appropriate procedure in a particular circumstance to save the life or preserve the health of a woman, and only the doctor, in consultation with the patient, based upon the woman's particular circumstances, can make this decision. . .' 
Today I received an additional letter that I want to share with my colleagues from David Grimes, a physician in San Francisco, CA. He tells the story--that he had never used this procedure that Senator Santorum wants to outlaw. But he talks about it this way, and the time that he did use it recently. 
He says:  
A woman in the Bay Area became seriously ill with preeclampsia (which is toxemia of pregnancy) at 24 weeks' gestation. She had a dangerous and extreme form of disease, called HELLP syndrome . . . she had liver failure and abnormal blood-clotting ability. The pregnancy had to be terminated to save her life. 
During several days spent unsuccessfully in attempts to induce labor, her medical condition continued to deteriorate. Finally, in desperation, the attending physician called me to assist . . . 
He said he accomplished the procedure in a manner of minutes with very little blood loss. 
She recovered quickly thereafter, and her physician discharged her home in good condition after a few weeks. 
He said: 
. . . I received a lovely thank you note from her husband. 
You know, this isn't only about women. It is about their loving husbands and their loving fathers. 
He `received a . . . note from her husband thanking me for saving his wife's life.' 
And the doctor said: 
In this instance, an intact D&E was the fastest and safest option available to me and to the patient. Congress must not take this option away. 
So, yet--and I have many other letters from physicians--that is exactly what this Congress is set to do. With the exception of 1 physician, who I don't believe is an OB-GYN, we have 99 people in here who do not know a whit about being an obstetrician or gynecologist. They don't have any training, at least that I know of. 
I find it the height of--I don't even know the right word to use--the `height of ego,' I guess, to think that we would know more than a physician, we would pass legislation that would take an option away from a physician. I can't believe that we would be doing this. 
I can tell you, I just had a community meeting in California. Maybe I knew 2 people out of 700 people that came out to the community meeting. The floor was open. It was their meeting. And not one of them stood up in that meeting and said, `Senator Boxer, you ought to go there and outlaw medical procedures.' 
What they told me is go back there and get that budget balanced, educate our children, and preserve our freedoms. 
So I have to say this is now the third time we have taken up this debate. It is the third time. It is painful. It is difficult. The reason I find it so painful is because in the name of saving pain, this Congress is going to vote for a bill that is going to cause families pain, and not just momentary pain, but 
long-lasting pain, because when a woman loses her fertility it is long-lasting pain, or if a woman gets paralyzed it is long-lasting pain. 
I want to talk to you about a couple of other women: 
Maureen Britell, a 30-year-old, Irish-Catholic mother of two, who lives in Massachusetts. On February 17, Maureen and her husband were awaiting--this is in 1994--joyously awaiting the birth of their second child. On that date, when she was 5 months pregnant, a sonogram determined that her daughter had no brain and could not live outside the womb. Her doctor recommended termination of the pregnancy. The next day a third-degree sonogram at the New England Medical Center in Boston confirmed the diagnosis that the baby had no brain and was not viable. 
Maureen and her family sought counsel from their parish priest, Father Greg, who supported the decision to terminate the pregnancy. Let me repeat that. Maureen and her family sought counsel from their parish priest, Father Greg, who supported the decision to terminate the pregnancy. They named their daughter Dahlia. She had a Catholic funeral, and was buried at Otis Air Force Base in Cape Cod. 
So Senators are going to interfere with the decision made by a family, its doctor, and their God. And by the passage of the Santorum legislation, if in fact it is going to pass, which indications are it will, that is just what we are doing--the height of ego. `We know better than a doctor. We know better than a priest. We know better than a rabbi. We are going to be in the hospital room. We are going to say what medical procedures can't be performed.' 
What is the next one? There are no pretty medical procedures, period. What is the next one that we are going to stand up here and outlaw? 
I want you to meet Eileen Sullivan. 
Eileen Sullivan, with 10 brothers and sisters, runs a nursery school in southern California. And she is an Irish-Catholic woman. 
Eileen writes, `For as long as I can remember, being in the company of children was when I was happiest. So when my husband and I watched the home pregnancy test slowly show a positive result, we were ecstatic. After three years of trying to conceive a baby, I didn't believe it. So I kept checking the test against the diagram on the package. Sure enough, we had done it. We were going to have a baby.' 
Eileen continues: 
My long awaited pregnancy was easy and blissful. As I charted my baby's growth week by week, the bond grew stronger between us. Many nights I spoke to my baby, saying that I accepted it just as it was, boy or girl, with dark eyes like mine or blue like my husband's. I didn't care--I was just so happy that we would finally be parents. 
At 26 weeks, Eileen went to her obstetrician for a routine ultrasound. After a few moments, her doctor got quiet and began to focus intently on the monitor. The doctor confirmed that there was a problem and sent Eileen and her husband to have tests immediately. 
The Sullivans went to a genetic specialist for another ultrasound. The doctor concluded that among other things: the baby's brain was improperly formed and being pressured by a back-up of fluid. 
His head was enlarged, his heart was malformed, his liver was malfunctioning, and there was a dangerously low amount of amniotic fluid. 
According to Eileen, for 2 hours the specialist detailed the baby's anomalies. Eileen writes, `My husband and I held one another and tried to understand what was happening. This was a nightmare. We spoke to a genetics counselor and had a battery of additional tests including an amniocentesis and a placenta biopsy.' 
She continues: `When the tests came back, the prognosis was the same--the anomalies were incompatible with life.' 
`Not wanting to accept this,' she writes, `we went to another specialist--a pediatric cardiologist. His prognosis was no better. According to the cardiologist, our baby's heart condition was lethal and he would not live.' 
She continues: `We wept. We discussed what we should do, what was best and safest for myself and the baby. After all the talking was over, we were faced with the hardest decision of our lives, and we opted to do what we thought was right. We opted to undergo a late-term abortion. Our long awaited, much anticipated baby was not going to make it, and there was nothing we could do to change that.' 
Eileen continues: `What we could do is choose the best way to end our pregnancy and help improve our chances of future pregnancy. I had had cervical cancer.' 
She goes into all the problems and all the reasons why she had to make this choice. She said, `We chose * * * a safe, surgical procedure that protected my health, spared my baby needless suffering and allowed us to hold our child and say our goodbyes. This is the procedure that would be banned by the legislation you are considering today.' And she says, `Please leave these difficult medical decisions where they belong--between women, their families and their doctors.' 
So I think you have seen, Mr. President, that the women who have undergone these surgeries wanted these children desperately. Their husbands wanted these children desperately. They were religious, they are religious women. Many of them say they do not consider themselves pro-choice. But what we would do with the Santorum legislation is to take away an option that saved their fertility, saved their health, and perhaps even saved their lives. 
Why on Earth would we do this? I believe the Feinstein-Boxer-Moseley-Braun alternative is the sane way to go, the appropriate way to go. It keeps these decisions where they belong, and yet it says the only time that an abortion in the late term will be allowed would be when the woman's life is in danger or her health is in danger. So I proudly stand with my colleagues, and I urge my colleagues to be strong, to be courageous. I listen to these ads. I read these ads. They are misleading. They use hot button words, and I have to tell you, if you look at this and you look at these women, this, my friends, is the truth. These women stand and tell the truth. Let us stand with them. 
I thank you, I say to my friend and colleague, and I yield the floor.  
Mr. SANTORUM addressed the Chair.

Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, there is about 2 minutes remaining? Thank you. 
Let me just thank my colleague. Again, I have been extremely proud to stand with her, really proud to stand with her and Senator Moseley-Braun. When we started maybe we had 3 votes, our own. I do believe we will do considerably better than that. I do believe, if the people who watch this debate--that we would get even more votes if they would get on the phone and tell their Senator what this is all really about. 
I was going to ask my colleague, but since there is no time to ask a particular question I want to share with her an editorial today that ran in USA Today, because it backs up everything my colleague has said. It says that: `The Partial-Birth ban would stop few, if any, abortions.' We know that is true because the Santorum bill does not go after any other procedure. `But it would set a precedent of lawmakers playing doctor.' 
I think this point has been made by us, over and over again. We do have a lot of confidence in ourselves around here. To be a U.S. Senator you have to have confidence. But we do not have, save for one of us, a medical degree. It is the height of ego, to me, to then decide we are going to be, not only lawmakers, but doctors. It is really somewhat extraordinary. Especially, it is more extraordinary because this issue is going to be so harmful to women.

I would say the one thing that broke my heart today was when the Senator from Pennsylvania said, `How could someone kill their son or daughter.' They are talking about these women, these women who desperately wanted these children. These families like Coreen Costello, and Eileen Sullivan. These are the faces: Viki Wilson and Maureen Britell. And, last, Vikki Stella. 
These women, these men, these families wanted these babies. They did not kill their child. They desperately wanted a baby. I yield.

Mrs. BOXER. I am appreciative of the Senator taking to the floor today to discuss this entire issue. We all learned growing up that justice delayed is justice denied. 
We have these openings. Look, I was told very clearly by the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, `Senator, you have to come in with nominations that will pass by Republicans and Democrats. You need to bring forward nominees who are supported by Republicans and Democrats.' 
Mr. President, I have done just that. I think Senator Leahy has outlined this magnificently--I have never seen a nominee with such bipartisan support as this woman. This is what is so extraordinary about the kind of treatment she is receiving: a secret hold that has been placed on her. 
Mr. President, this is not the way to run the U.S. Senate. Let's allow this woman's name to be placed on the floor and then those who have any objection can express their objections and vote no. But I am so confident that the vast majority of our colleagues will vote for Margaret Morrow. 
I say that not only because of her extraordinary bipartisan support, but because of her incredible qualifications. I say to my friend from Vermont how much I appreciate his leadership on this. Sometimes we forget these nominees have private lives. This is a woman who is a law partner in a law firm making preparations for a new career. She is a 45-year-old wife and mother. She has a very loving family. They are very proud of her. They are completely mystified about these questions that keep coming. I have talked to several members of the Judiciary Committee, both Democrats and Republicans, and when I speak with them, I say to you, Mr. President, one on one, I am very confident that Margaret Morrow will get a vote and a fair vote. 
I want to quote from one letter that is so important. 
H. Walter Croskey, associate justice in the Court of Appeals for the State of California, Second Appellate District, describes himself, Mr. President, as a conservative Republican. He has written to Senator Hatch, and he wrote to Senator Hatch about an article he read that suggested that `concerns have been raised in the [Judiciary] Committee about judicial activism and noted that there were questions as to whether Margaret would be a judge who would follow the Constitution and the laws as they are written.' He says, `Such concerns are not shared by anyone who knows Margaret.' And he goes on to say, `Her well known and often expressed reverence for our system of government and justice and her great intellectual integrity provides full assurance that she would be the kind of judge who would follow and apply the laws as written * * *.' 
He goes on. 
Mr. President, we have Republican after Republican from my State. This particular judge was appointed by George Deukmejian, Republican Governor of the State of California. 
Mayor Richard Riordan, Sheriff Sherman Block, a Republican-elected sheriff, supports her nomination. 
So it is so difficult, frankly, for this Senator to understand why we would play with the life of a woman like this and not give her her fair chance. 
I understand that women's organizations have written to Senator Leahy and Senator Hatch. They have been very patient. But when you see a panel of people, as Senator Leahy has described, three men and one woman, and the three men get reported out of the committee--and I venture to say, I know they are all extremely qualified--I would put Margaret's qualifications right up against any of those. 
So I am very pleased that my colleague, the ranking member on the Judiciary Committee, has raised this issue. I am hopeful, I say to my friend and the Presiding Officer today, that because Senator Grassley has lifted his objection to bringing the nomination to the floor and others on the committee have done the same, that they will prevail upon that secret hold, they will find who that particular Senator is who has put a hold here. If we start putting holds on each other's nominations and on each other's bills and on each other's amendments, I say to my friend, we are only going to deteriorate in this U.S. Senate. The people expect more. 
To reiterate Mr. President, I come to the floor today to urge that Margaret M. Morrow be voted out of the Judiciary Committee and confirmed to sit on the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California. 
Margaret Morrow is an outstanding candidate for the Federal bench, who enjoys broad bipartisan support. She has over a dozen support letters from prominent, widely respected Republicans, including judges, elected officials, and others. It has been my honor to recommend such a fine candidate to the President. Her name was submitted to me by my judicial advisory committee for the Central District of California. My committee enthusiastically found her to be a superior judicial candidate. 
However, despite her strong bipartisan support and strong credentials, her nomination remains indefinitely stalled in committee. She has had two hearings, and has had several rounds of questions with no end in sight. No Member has come forward to explain why she should not be confirmed.

Mrs. BOXER. Ms. Morrow's qualifications and the broad support she enjoys would make her an exceptionally distinguished addition to the Federal bench. 
Finally, her qualifications and the broad support she enjoys makes her an exceptionally distinguished addition to the Federal bench. Mr. President, the Judiciary Committee has already reviewed Ms. Morrow's background, which is outstanding. To echo the recent words of Republican Judge Pamela Rymer, appointed in 1989 to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals by President Bush, I too am looking forward to the day Margaret Morrow sits on the bench of the U.S. Federal District Court in the Central District of California. I am in agreement with Judge Rymer that Ms. Morrow will bring distinction to the district court. 
In sum, Mr. President, I continue to strongly support Ms. Morrow's renomination by President Clinton. 
I am fully confident that the Members of the Senate when fully informed will agree with me that Margaret Morrow's qualifications are outstanding and she is deserving of expeditious Senate confirmation. Her exceptional experience as an attorney, her professional service, and her deep commitment to justice qualify her to serve our Nation and the people of California with great distinction. And as evidenced by the letters I have read from, she has strong bipartisan support from some of the most prominent and conservative Republicans in my State. 
Again, my deep thanks to my friend for yielding.

Mrs. BOXER. Thank you very much, Mr. President. 
When my colleague from Pennsylvania started this debate, he asked that a 5 1/2 -year-old be allowed in the gallery, that the Senate rules be waived. And then he went on--and I am quoting very much from his text--he went on to talk about what he believes that a medical procedure, which he has called a barbaric act, a procedure that doctors tell us is used to save the life of the woman, to spare her irreparable harm--and he calls that a `murderous act'--his words. He used the term over and over about `killing a baby.' He ascribed it to the President of the United States. He wanted a 5 1/2 -year-old to hear that. 
He said, you will hear words like `rights,' and then he quoted women, and he said, `I can kill this baby.' Is that what he thinks women want to do? And he wants a 5 1/2 -year-old to hear that? 
Talk about messages that we are sending out, this is the greatest country in the world. We ought to approach these issues as a family, not turn one group against another, one gender against another. 
Mr. President, this is the third time we are having this debate. And every time it is more painful than the one before. And the reason it is so painful is because the basic assumption of the Santorum bill is that women do not deserve the full range of medical options available to them in order to have a safe and legal abortion. 
I know that every Senator in this U.S. Senate who calls himself or herself pro-choice believes, as the President of the United States believes, that abortion must be safe, legal, and rare. 
Mr. President, I truly believe--and I will explain it in the body of my statement--that what the Santorum bill is really about is outlawing one procedure, and then they will go after the next procedure, and then they will go after the next and the next. And that will be the way abortion is made illegal in this country at any stage. 
Mr. President, that is not the view of the American people. They believe very strongly that Government does not belong in this debate. 
Mr. President, the Santorum bill prohibits the use of a specific abortion procedure, the intact dilation and extraction regardless of the medical needs of the woman. But some doctors consider that procedure the safest for the women. I am not saying that every doctor says that; I am saying many, many doctors believe that. And yet, the Santorum bill would outlaw this procedure. 
The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, an organization representing more than 37,000 physicians stated that an intact dilation and extraction `may be the best or most appropriate procedure in a particular circumstance to save the life or preserve the health of a woman, and only the doctor, in consultation with the patient, based upon the woman's particular circumstances, can make this decision.' 
That is 37,000 doctors who are trained in obstetrics and gynecology. 
Doctor Charles Bradley, medical director of Planned Parenthood in Santa Barbara, CA, wrote to me and said: 
The intact dilation and extraction procedure presents several advantages over the other techniques available for late-term abortion. Foremost among these, the procedure is short and the risk of damage to the mother's tissues and, therefore, the risk to her life and health is considerably reduced. 
Dr. Seymour Romney, chair of the Society for Physicians for Reproductive Choice and Health sent me a letter. And he wrote: 
In complicated and some potentially tragic obstetrical situations, intact dilation and extraction can be the safest therapeutic procedure. In competent hands, it carries the least risk of bleeding, perforation, infection or trauma to the birth canal. 
So this is a procedure that many doctors say is the safest, and yet the Santorum bill would outlaw it. 
Mr. President, this is not a perfect world. If we could make it so, every child would be planned, every child would be wanted, every pregnancy would be uncomplicated, every fetus would be viable, would be healthy, every father would be proud to take responsibility, every mother would be physically and mentally healthy, there would be no rape or no incest. That is the world we should strive for. That is the world we want. 
But, Mr. President, we are not there. This is not a perfect world. Families must make tough choices, and sometimes must decide, of course, to take, when things go tragically wrong--we must not pass reckless legislation which moves politicians into the hospital rooms where we do not belong. Mr. President, we do not belong in a hospital room. 
We have laws in this land. We have court decisions in this land. And the laws relating to pregnancies are set. And they say, as follows: Before viability in the early stages of a pregnancy, a woman gets to decide, with her family and her doctor and with her God, what her options are. It is her choice. It is not Senator Boxer's choice. It is not Senator Santorum's choice. It is not Senator Helms' choice. It is not Senator Feinstein's choice. It is her choice. She will make this decision with her family, with her loving family, with her doctor. She decides. And that is it. And that is what the law says. And it was decided in 1973, in a previability situation, a woman has the right to choose. 
There are those in this Chamber who want Government to enter this debate and stop that constitutionally protected right. And to do that they need a constitutional amendment. And for many years now they have not tried that because the American people do not support it. So they will go to procedures one at a time. They will do what it takes so in essence this constitutionally protected right will become meaningless to the women of this country. 
How does the Santorum bill, endorsed by the antichoice groups in this country, treat a woman in the early stages of her pregnancy where, under law, it is her constitutional right to decide? 
The Santorum bill says to the doctor that a particular procedure called intact dilation and extraction--and as Senator Santorum has given it a name of his own, partial-birth abortion, which is in no medical dictionary--that procedure is banned at any time. Any time in the pregnancy, before viability or after viability, it would be banned. And we know right off the bat that outlawing procedures in the previability stage of pregnancy before the fetus can live outside the womb, with or without life support, is a clear violation of Roe versus Wade, on which the constitutional right to choose is based. 
So let us be clear. The Santorum bill infringes on a woman's right to choose in the earliest stages of her pregnancy and is clearly unconstitutional and against the law of the land. 
In the late term what do the laws say? Postviability, the court decisions say that the Government does have a legitimate interest and can legislate, can legislate postviability, but with a caveat. And that is, that always the health of the woman and the life of the woman must be considered. 
Let me repeat. Postviability, the Government can act to regulate abortion, but always the health of the woman and her life must always be protected. 
What does the Santorum bill do in the late term? It outlaws the procedure and fails to give a health exception. My colleagues, this is dangerous. There is no health exception in the Santorum bill. And that is callous toward the women of this country. 
Court cases have always ruled that any laws passed regarding abortion--and there are many of these in the States; and my colleague, Senator Feinstein, has become a real expert on studying what the States have done--they always make an exception for the health of the woman. And this U.S. Senate, under this bill, would be so radical as to not address the health of a woman. 
This is very troubling to me, Mr. President. And I believe it shows a lack of concern for the women of this country, many of whom want their stories told. 
In the interest of time, I am not going to go into all the stories that I have, but I am going to talk about one. And perhaps in the debate later on I will give you the other stories, because we must put a face on this issue. 
This is Coreen Costello with her family. She happens to be a registered Republican. She describes herself as very conservative. And she is very clear that she and her family do not believe in abortion. 
In March 1995, when she was 7 months pregnant--actually this is a photograph of her when she was pregnant--she was 7 months pregnant with her third child, and she had premature contractions and was rushed to the emergency room. 
She discovered through an ultrasound that there was something seriously wrong with her baby. The baby, named Katherine Grace--she named her baby Katherine Grace while she was carrying her baby--had a lethal neurological disorder and had been unable to move inside Coreen's womb for almost 2 full months. The movements Coreen had been feeling were not that of a healthy, kicking baby. They were nothing more than fluid which had puddled in Coreen's uterus. The baby had not moved for a long time--not her eyelids, not her tongue. The baby's chest cavity was unable to rise or fall. As a result of this, her lungs were never stretched to prepare them for air. Her lungs and chest were left severely underdeveloped to the point of almost nonexistence. Her vital organs were atrophied. 
The doctors told Coreen and her husband the baby was not going to survive, and they recommended termination of the pregnancy. To Coreen and Jim Costello, termination of the pregnancy was not an option. Coreen wanted to go into labor naturally. She wanted the baby born on God's time and did not want to interfere. 
The Costello's spent 2 weeks going from expert to expert. They considered many options, but every option brought severe risks. They considered inducing labor, but they would be told it would be impossible due to the baby's position and the fact that the baby's head was so swollen with fluid it was already larger than that of a full-term baby. They considered a cesarean section, but the doctors were adamant that the risk to her health and her life were too great. Coreen said, `There was no reason to risk leaving my two children motherless if there was no hope of saving Katherine Grace.' 
These are the women my colleague stands and talks about as wanting to kill their babies? I am ashamed of that. It is unnecessary to talk about the mothers of America, the women of America in such a fashion. 
Coreen and her husband faced a tragedy that most people, thank God, never have to face. In the end, they made a decision which saved Coreen's life. She underwent a late-term abortion. 
In December of last year, I showed you this picture of Coreen and her family, and I reminded you at the time of this photo, Coreen was pregnant with Katherine Grace. Now I want to show another picture of the Costello family. Here is Coreen and her family with their newest addition, her son, Tucker. 
Coreen writes that she is against abortion. She is a registered Republican. She says she is a conservative. She writes to us, `This would not have been possible without this procedure. Please give other women and their families a chance. Let us deal with our tragedies without any unnecessary interference from our Government.' She writes, `Leave us with our God, our families and our trusted medical experts.' 
Now, that is one story. To me, it just says it all, that this Santorum bill, if it became the law of the land, could have resulted in this woman dying or being impaired or losing her fertility. We stand here and talk as if the mothers of this country, the women of this country, want to end these pregnancies, when, in fact, these women--again, I have many of these stories which I will tell tomorrow, story after story--the last thing they wanted was to end the pregnancy. They wanted these babies. 
Mr. President, I want to put the face of these women into the debate. I know those who wish to ban this procedure want the face of the woman gone. I want to show you what the New York Times quotes Ralph Reed, the head of the Christian Coalition, as saying in a March 23, 1997 article. This appeared:  
`Mr. Reed said that by focusing on the grizzly procedure itself--and on the potential viability of a fetus--abortion foes undercut the primacy of the woman and made her secondary to the fetus.' 
In other words, what Mr. Reed is quoted as saying, in what I consider to be an unguarded moment, is the reason he was so excited about this debate is that for the first time, the woman was made secondary to the fetus. 
Those who are pushing this bill want us to forget about the women. As Ralph Reed is quoted as having said, to forget about our daughters, our sisters, our nieces. They want us to forget about them. 
Why, the Senator from Pennsylvania, in his opening remarks, portrayed women as killers. His words: `I have a right to kill this baby,' as if that is what a woman wants to do. 
If they succeed in outlawing this procedure, they will go to the next and the next, as I have said. With all due respect to my colleagues on the other side of this debate, they are very good at getting votes and they are very good at winning elections. But I do not think they are worth a whit in the gynecological operating room. I do not want them in that operating room telling a doctor what procedure to use for my daughter or my niece or, frankly, even for their daughter or their niece. 
If a loved one--and I ask all Americans to think about this. Think about it, think of a woman in your life of child-bearing age. Think of that woman, be it your wife, be it your aunt, be it your sister, be it your niece, be it your daughter, be it your granddaughter, think of that woman, have that woman in front of your face, and think if that woman was in trouble with a pregnancy gone tragically wrong like Coreen's pregnancy. I will put her and her family's picture back up. Suppose you found out that she was carrying a fetus whose brain was growing outside the head, where the doctor has said to you the baby would live but a few moments, maybe, and in torture, and that your loved one, if this particular procedure were not used, because many have said it is, in fact, the safest, might suffer irreparable harm, irreparable harm, never to be able to have a child again, maybe could be blinded, maybe could be paralyzed. In your heart of hearts, you would not want Senators making that decision. You would want the decision to be made by the medical experts, the best in the world. 
I do not want that doctor afraid at that moment that he or she might be hauled off to jail if he acted to help a family to spare a woman's life or health. I do not want that loved one in despair, pain, and grief to be told that her openings were narrowed because her doctor was afraid to do what he or she really thought had to be done to save her fertility or to save her life or to save her health. 
Who decides? Senator Santorum? I hope not. Who decides? Senator Boxer? I hope not. I know politicians have big egos, but we are not doctors. We can show drawings done by a doctor, but that does not qualify us. Where is the humility around here? Why do we not just do our job? I think every woman in this country deserves a free range of options when she is in deep, deep trouble. 
Mr. President, Senators Feinstein, Moseley-Braun, and I have a bill that I believe is the most humane and the most sensible and the most constitutional of those that will be before the Senate. It zeros in on the timeframe that concerns most Americans, and that is the late term of a pregnancy, after viability, and is consistent with Roe versus Wade, which says the Government has an interest after viability. Our bill outlaws all post-viability abortions--all procedures, not just one. The Santorum bill does not do that. It zeros in on one procedure. We say after the fetus is viable, no abortion, no procedure except to protect the woman's life or to spare her serious adverse health consequences. 
Life and health are constitutional requirements, and it is the right thing to do for the women of this country. Mr. President, if we abandon the principle that a woman's health and life must always be considered when an abortion is considered, we are harming women, plain and simple, women like Coreen Costello and the other women that I will talk about. 
Mr. President, the day we start passing laws that harm half of our population--women are more than half of our population--the day we start passing laws that harm more than half of our population is the day I will worry about the future of this, the greatest country in the world. 
Mr. President, I just celebrated my second Mother's Day as a grandmother, and my daughter celebrated her second Mother's Day as a mom. This is the greatest thing for our family. And everyone who always said to me, `When you are a grandmother, you will see how great it is,' including Senator Feinstein, who told me that years ago, I thought, well, maybe they are exaggerating. You know what? They are not. To see your baby have a baby, to get the continuity of life is an extraordinary feeling. 
I happen to believe as I watch my daughter be a great mother that America's moms deserve to be honored every day. We just celebrated Mother's Day. They deserve to be honored every day. 
Senator Byrd came down right before Mother's Day and talked about the incredible job that our moms are doing, working moms, supermoms, working hard so that families have the resources to educate their children, to give their children the American dream. It is hard for me to imagine why we would want to pass legislation that will harm women. 
Now, it is interesting to me, in the Santorum bill, this procedure is outlawed. As a matter of fact, the Senator from Pennsylvania called it a barbaric act, and yet in his own bill he says, `The procedure can be used when it is necessary to save the life of the mother' if you can't find another medical procedure. 
So, first, he says it is barbaric. And then he admits in his legislation that it may be necessary to save the life of the mother. 
So what is this really all about? It is about banning one procedure and then the next and then the next. Women as moms and future moms should not be put at risk because the big arm of Government wants to reach further into their private medical and family physician. 
We can pass a bill that respects women and their families, that is caring and trusting toward American moms and future moms while protecting a baby in the post-viability stage of pregnancy. We can pass a bill that is consistent with Roe. 
That is what the Feinstein-Boxer-Moseley-Braun bill is about. This bill should not be about what the New York Times article quotes Ralph Reed as saying, which reveals, I think, a real malice toward the women of this country--that a woman should be secondary to a fetus. This should not be about mothers versus fetuses. This should be about all of us together as a society passing laws that help our families cope with tragedy and urgency in a way that is moral and in a way that is respectful of everyone involved. 
So this is a painful debate, Mr. President, but my intent is clear. I will not allow the fate of the woman to be lost in this debate. I will tell story after story after story about the Coreen Costellos of our Nation who are loving, caring moms, many of whom would never have an abortion at any stage unless they were told they had to have one to spare their life or to preserve their fertility so they can be alive for their families, for their other children. 
I will do all I can to spare families long-lasting, horrible pain that I think would come about as a result of the Santorum bill putting Senators into a hospital room and making decisions they are not qualified to make. I think this bill will cause pain to innocent, caring, and loving families in the name of sparing pain. It is a first step toward making all abortions illegal. 
If you ask those who are on the floor and if you study their record, you will see they are on record as wanting to ban all abortions from the first second. 
So, Mr. President, although this is a very painful debate for all of us, I will be here throughout this debate. I will work with my colleagues to put the fate of the woman on this debate, to never let anyone forget what we are doing if we pass this bill, which is to hurt American families. That is my deep belief. 
If you are really about making sure that there is no abortion post-viability in the late term, you have the Daschle proposal that deals with it, and you have the Feinstein-Boxer-Moseley-Braun proposal. If you really want to do something about what Americans care about, that is what you should do. But don't go to a procedure which you say is barbaric, but then you allow it in the case of a woman's life, ban that and tell the American people you are doing something about the late term which, in fact, you are not when, in fact, what you are doing is interfering with medical treatment of women who--all of these women--are put in tragic circumstances where they could have lost their life or their health. 
Thank you very much. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mrs. BOXER. As my colleagues are aware, the Department of Education has determined that the requirement that States provide eligible students with a free, appropriate public education extends to people under age 21 convicted of felonies as adults and incarcerated in adult prisons. Under current law, if a State fails to provide special education services to eligible prisoners, that State faces the loss of all Federal special education funding. I believe strongly that this mandate is wrong. I introduced legislation last week, S. 702, which would amend IDEA to exempt people convicted as adults and incarcerated in adult prisons. 
This issue is particularly important to the State of California. My State does not provide special education services in adult prisons, and as a result, faces the loss of over $300 million in Federal special education assistance. It seems unconscionable to me that the needs of approximately 600,000 California special needs children could be jeopardized because my State does not provide special education services to an estimated 1,500 prisoners. 
It is my understanding that this bill makes several significant amendments to these provisions and dramatically changes the scope of sanctions that can be imposed on States for failing to provide special education services to those incarcerated in adult prisons. Would the Senator elaborate on these changes?

Mrs. BOXER. In the State of California, approximately one-fourth of 1 percent of all people eligible for special education are convicted of felonies as adults and incarcerated in adult prisons. 
It is my understanding that under this bill, if California does not provide special education services in prisons it stands to lose only one-fourth of 1 percent of its allotted share. California would no longer face the possible loss of 100 percent of its allotted special education funds. I would ask the Senator from Iowa, is my understanding correct?

Mrs. BOXER. I thank the Chair. 
Mr. President, today the Senate is considering the Emergency Supplemental Appropriations and Rescissions Act for 1997. I am a member of the Appropriations Committee, which wrote this bill, and, despite my strong reservations about several provisions, I voted to send the bill to the full Senate. 
I voted to bring this measure to the floor because it will provide much needed assistance to my State of California, which suffered massive loss and damage from the terrible winter floods a few months ago, and is still paying for cleanup and repair of damage from 15 other natural disasters in the past few years. 
Before I talk about the specifics of this bill, I would like to offer my deepest appreciation to the chairman of the Appropriations Committee, Senator Stevens, and the committee's ranking member, Senator Byrd. They and their staff have been so helpful to me and my staff in making sure this bill addresses the needs of California. I am sincerely grateful for their assistance. 
California suffered enormous losses from the winter floods this year. The scope of the floods is unprecedented in modern times: Over 300 square miles of land flooded; 48 of California's 58 counties declared natural disaster areas by the President; 120,000 people forced to leave their homes--the largest emergency evacuation in the State's history; 9 lives lost; estimated $1.8 billion in damages to property; and unprecedented structural damage to one of the most popular natural sites in the world, Yosemite National Park. 
Californians are also still coping with losses and trying to rebuild after 15 earlier natural disasters, from the Loma Prieta earthquake in October 1989, to the severe fires in southern California last October. 
This fiscal year 1997 emergency supplemental bill will help California in many important ways: 
First, emergency aid to people who need help coping with the immediate impact of the floods; 
Second, help for local governments and the State to repair or rebuild public works projects, including levees, dams, roads, bridges, and other infrastructure; 
Third, assistance to farmers and ranchers who have sustained damage and loss of land, crops, orchards, and livestock, to help them reestablish their businesses; 
Fourth, funds to repair and rebuild at Yosemite Park, in order to meet the needs of the more than 1 1/2 million visitors it receives each year. 
I ask unanimous consent to include in the Congressional Record at this point a detailed list of how California will benefit from the bill.

Mrs. BOXER. Unfortunately, Mr. President, this legislation contains several controversial provisions which I strongly oppose, including: First, substantive and significant changes to the Endangered Species Act; second, a prohibition on enforcing a new policy protecting Federal wilderness areas, parks and wildlife refuges from road construction; third, a prohibition on implementing the most effective and least costly method of taking an accurate census in 2000; and fourth, the automatic continuing resolution for fiscal year 1998. 
In addition, I believe the bill as currently written fails to provide enough additional funds in fiscal year 1997 for the Women, Infants, and Children Nutrition Program. The President requested $100 million to cover shortfalls in projected caseload maintenance requirements for the balance of the fiscal year. However, the bill reported by the committee provides only $58 million. 
I hope that these flaws will be corrected later in the legislative process, before the bill becomes law. 
Regarding the automatic continuing resolution, which is title VII of the bill as reported, I am extremely disappointed that this provision is still in the bill. I had understood that as part of the bipartisan budget agreement, announced last week by the President and congressional leaders, the automatic continuing would be taken out of the supplemental bill and voted on separately later. I am sorry that did not happen. 
I want to start off where the Senator from Arizona left off, so before he leaves the floor let me assure him and the Senator from Texas--and the Senator from Texas and I did get into quite a discussion in the Chamber. People said to me, well, do you get along with the Senator? I said I really like the Senator from Texas. We just disagree on this. I absolutely do not question anyone's motives in any way, shape or form. What I do question is what outcome we would have to live with if the Senator's amendment were to pass. 
So I just wanted to assure the Senators who have offered this amendment in the committee, I do not question their motivation at all. What I question is the outcome. And as I look at the outcome, if this Government goes on automatic pilot, Californians get hurt. 
What is interesting about that is here is a wonderful bill that is going to ease the pain of the victims of the flood, is going to ease the pain of victims from disasters that occurred years ago where we are still rebuilding in California, and yet there is this amendment tucked into the bill, which has nothing to do with this bill, nothing to do with natural disasters. Californians who have suffered mightily in the floods and lost their homes and their businesses. This automatic CR which is tucked into this emergency supplemental appropriations bill will cause cuts in education and a whole host of other important things. So here we have a very important bill--indeed, Mr. President, a crucial bill. I want to say to my colleagues from both sides of the aisle on the Appropriations Committee, of which I am a new member, how much I appreciate the help we received from both the Republican side and the Democratic side in putting together this bill. It really answers the call of help from North Dakota, from California, and the other 20 States that were hit by terrible natural disasters. The help we will get to Yosemite, to our farmers, to our people for our roads and our highways, that help is very much appreciated. 
What disturbed me is that added to this important bill are these riders that have nothing to do with the issues at hand. You had an amendment tucked in there on the census, on the Endangered Species Act, on allowing the States to pave over very precious parts of our national parks and wilderness areas, all this is tucked into this bill, including this automatic continuing resolution. 
Now, I know, because I have been around Congress for a while, that we do use these bills on occasion to add other issues, but I have never seen so many controversial issues added to a bill like this. We usually can come together on consensus issues and add them. 
I want to address the issue that was raised by the Senator from Arizona, and before him the Senator from Texas, who wrote this automatic CR, that this is very appropriate to be attached to this bill, and I see my colleague is here. Her contention is that the Government shutdown was a man-made disaster, and therefore having this automatic CR, if we cannot agree on appropriations bills, is very appropriate for this bill. 
Now, the last time when the Senator from Texas and I got into a little debate in the Chamber the point I was making was that never in our history until last year did we ever have an extended shutdown of the Government. We never had it under other Republican leadership and other Democratic leadership. We worked out our differences. We did our job. And I want to say very clearly for the record and for my people from California, the largest State in the Union, that I did not come here to shut down this Government. I also did not come here to put this Government on automatic pilot. And to present those two choices to the American people as the only choices that we have is presenting a false choice. 
This Constitution is very clear on the responsibilities of the 
Congress. The rules of the Congress are very clear on how we are to do our jobs: get a budget resolution to the floor in April, and after that budget resolution is passed, allow the appropriators to do their job. 
Is it an easy job? No, it is not. Does it require compromise? Yes, it does. Does it require tough debate? Yes, it does. But that is what we are here for. That is what we get paid to do. 
I say to you that I am very tempted, but I did not do it, to offer an amendment that would say if we do not pass a budget--no automatic CR, no easy way out--if we do not pass our appropriations bills and we come to another stalemate--and I know; I offered this up the last time; it made me a most unpopular person--we should not get paid, just like the Federal employees did not get paid. But I did not choose to do that. I hope my colleagues would rethink this whole thing. We know what we have to do to avoid a Government shutdown--simply do the job we were sent here to do. 
I said before that my people would be hurt in California if this automatic CR went into effect. Even though the Senators changed their resolution to 100 percent of fiscal year 1997 levels, we would still have a reduction of about $25 billion from the President's funding levels. Clearly, this is a great problem for us. 
What it would mean to my State is very clear. College aid would be cut by approximately $1.26 billion nationwide, and about $126 million of that would be a loss for my State. My California students would suffer under this automatic CR. Nationally, about 280,000 students would lose their Pell grants. Those Pell grants are crucial so that our children can get an education. Under that scenario, approximately 28,000 California students would lose their Pell grants. Aid to approximately 1,400 school districts would be cut; about 6.5 percent of the school districts are in California. 
Cleanup of approximately 630 Superfund sites would be delayed. Those Superfund sites must be cleaned up. Approximately 80 of those sites are located in California. We would not be able to clean up 80 Superfund sites that are poisoning the water because the pollutants are sinking down into the water supply. The CR would prevent the hiring of about 380 new FBI agents; around 2.5 percent of those are slated for work in California. 
If you ask the average person what is the enemy that we face today now that the cold war is over, they will tell you cancer, they will tell you Alzheimer's, they will tell you heart disease. Under this automatic CR, $414 million would be cut from the National Institutes of Health, and that is an area where we want to increase funding. As a matter of fact, I am a cosponsor of Senator Mack's bill to double the amount that we spend on the NIH, and here we would have a cut in the National Institutes of Health. 
The American people have already told us that they want us to invest in education, the environment, health care, and crime prevention. 
So, Mr. President, I do not in any way demean the reasons why my colleagues from Texas and Arizona have placed this automatic CR into the emergency bill. If they believe in their hearts it is good for America, I respect their view. But I have to say I did agree with my chairman, Senator Stevens, in the early part of the CR, or the emergency supplemental bill, when he said he would prefer this to be offered freestanding, and then he was convinced, no, it belonged on it. I think he was right originally. I think we should keep controversial amendments off this bill. 
It is true; immediately we are not going to see a problem in the States, but I want to say to my friend from Texas and to my friend from Arizona, who have offered this, people understand that this is a delay. You can stand up there all day and tell them, not a problem, but when this bill is sent to the White House and the President looks, he will say, I am not going to hurt education; I am not going to hurt health research.

Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, the emergency supplemental appropriations bill contains language that prohibits the Census Bureau from preparing to use any funds in the current fiscal year to `plan or otherwise prepare for the use of sampling in taking the 2000 decennial census.' I opposed this provision in the committee mark-up because the National Academy of Sciences [NAS], at the request of Congress, found sampling resulted in a more accurate census and that without sampling, the national effects have long-standing negative ramifications. I support Senator Hollings' amendment. 
A statistical sampling study was done by the National Academy of Sciences at the request of Congress. Others continue to question if sampling produces accurate data. I welcome that debate, but I believe this is not an issue to be decided in the emergency supplemental appropriations bill. There have been several congressional hearings on this subject, and I support that those committees should be given the opportunity to finish their work. I believe it would be unwise for Congress to stop further work on this issue in an emergency supplemental. Other supporters of using statistical sampling include the American Statistical Association, the Population Association of America, and the National Conference of Mayors. 
Sampling results in a more accurate census. The National Academy of Sciences concluded from their study that sampling was necessary for an accurate census count, and strongly recommended its use in the 2000 census to account for nonresponding households. The census is responsible for counting all residents in this country, including those overlooked by traditional polling methods. The process of sampling helps the Census Bureau count U.S. 
residents that may not respond to traditional outreach methods, that is, those who do not speak English well, or those who can not read or write proficiently. Big cities all across this country are home to many of these overlooked Americans. Relying solely on mailed responses and face-to-face visits, so-called direct enumeration, while critical, will guarantee an inaccurate census because we will essentially be saying if we can not find you, then we will not count you, and therefore you do not exist. The Constitution does not tell us to only count those who are at home, or who has time to fill out the form. The Constitution says every resident must be counted. 
Without sampling, the effects have long-standing negative ramifications. The National Academy of Sciences found in the 1990 census racial minorities were severely undercounted, compared to whites. Without sampling, the costs will increase due to added manpower and work hours involved. More census takers will have to be hired, trained and will have to knock on more doors, requiring a greater drain on the Nation's resources. For the 1990 census, those forms that were not returned by mail cost the U.S. Government at least 6 times more to enumerate than those who mailed back their forms. Using field staff to find the most reluctant respondents raised the cost as much as 18 times. 
Because of California's large racial minority population, California was more severely harmed by the undercount than other States. We need an accurate census because many important Federal programs depend on census data to allocate funding. In the 1990 census, it is estimated that 837,557 Californians were not counted, which caused California to be shorted more than $5 million in several Federal programs.

Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from New York for offering this amendment. I say to him, and I am sure Senator Feinstein will amplify this, that this is so crucial to our State, as he has said, and I know the Senator is aware--and I will put this in the form of a question--that in the budget agreement that was reached among all parties, this issue was recognized. What the Senator from New York is doing is carrying over this agreement, that these people need the certainty of assistance because they are very old, they are very frail, they are very disabled, and what the Senator is doing is, in essence, saying that that agreement ought to really apply right now and these people should not be under the threat of a cutoff. So he is restoring SSI to legal immigrants until all the new details are worked; am I correct in that?

Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss Senator Bumpers' amendment to strike section 310 of the supplemental appropriations bill related to rights-of-way across public lands. 
I support Senator Bumpers' amendment because it strikes language in the supplemental appropriations bill which is not only highly controversial and bad for public lands, but it also has nothing to do with emergency funding--the purpose of this supplemental appropriations bill. 
Rights-of-way is a principle of property use that allows for continued use of a pathway across public land when it can be proven that the path existed before the land was reserved for Federal designation--so a road that existed prior to the designation of the Yosemite National Park would be a valid right-of-way. 
In our Nation, any individual or local government can claim a right-of-way. The validity of this claim must then be determined. 
In 1988, then Secretary of the Interior Hodel developed policy guidelines for dealing with right-of-way claims over public land. 
The Hodel policy effectively deferred authority over rights-of-way determination to States and provided very broad guidelines to assist States in making these determinations. The guidelines allowed for a right-of-way to be granted if merely a large rock or vegetation was removed from an area. Once a right-of-way authority is granted, a small dirt footpath through Yosemite National Park could be converted to a six-lane paved highway. 
The Hodel policy makes it much easier for right-of-way claims to be asserted through many of our most precious environmental areas--including designated national parks, wildlife refuges, and wilderness areas. 
In January 1997, Secretary Babbitt revoked the Hodel policy, and instituted revised policy guidelines in an effort to put the Federal Government back in charge of protecting our remaining Federal lands. 
The Babbitt policy establishes a Federal process whereby right-of-way claims are evaluated. This policy would not allow a six-lane highway to tear up our precious national parks. It would ensure the rights-of-way be granted only for major roads that require such authority. And any alteration of the land would be susceptible to all Federal environmental regulations. 
Secretary Babbitt is unable to follow 
normal procedure for regulations--proposing rules in the Federal Register, receiving public comment, and promulgating final rules--because of provisions included in the past two Interior appropriations bill which prohibit such actions. In fiscal year 1996, the Secretary was entirely prohibited from promulgating rules concerning rights-of-way; and for fiscal year 1997, the Secretary is only able to propose such rules if expressly authorized by an act of Congress. 
If we are not allowed to move forward with Secretary of Interior Babbitt's policy, States will have the authority to determine the validity of existing rights-of-way claims. We therefore create the potential for destruction of valuable Federal lands--lands that belong to all the people of our Nation. 
Vast areas may be prohibited from wilderness designation because of right-of-way claims that scar the land. In my State of California, the current number of claims is relatively low. However the potential for claims is thought to be quite high. The Bureau of Land Management estimates that the 12 claims currently pending cover hundreds of miles of roads through California's unique wilderness areas. 
Remaining land in California's Mojave Desert, Death Valley, and Joshua Tree poses a serious potential problem should there be a right-of-way claim. 
With the California Desert Protection Act, Congress was finally able to protect these unique lands. The language of the bill now threatens the very protection we worked so hard to achieve. 
There are few remaining natural lands which have been held in trust by the Federal Government for all people to enjoy. These precious natural resources must be held to a high uniform standard which protect only valid rights-of-way claims while promoting environmentally responsible management of our Federal lands. These are Federal lands, and as such should be governed by Federal policy and procedure. 
In a letter to Chairman Stevens and Senator Byrd, Director of the Office of Management and Budget Frank Raines and Secretary of Interior Bruce Babbitt have both stated that they will recommend the President veto this legislation should this language be included. This is not the time to risk veto of legislation which will provide necessary aid and disaster relief to those who desperately need it. 
We saw the disastrous results that occurred from the salvage logging rider. This amendment is just that--an unnecessary, antienvironmental rider which could devastate our remaining public lands. 
I urge my colleagues to support Senator Bumpers' amendment. We must not prevent the administration from establishing necessary procedures for dealing with remaining right-of-way claims.

Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I want to take this opportunity to thank Senator Stevens, the chairman of the Appropriations Committee, and Senator Harry Reid, the ranking member for the Subcommittee on Energy and Water Development, for their help in obtaining the Senate's unanimous consent for an amendment I had requested to the disaster supplemental appropriations bill. 
The Senate on Tuesday accepted the amendment offered by Senator Stevens for Senator Reid that would allow the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to conduct emergency dredging and snagging and clearing of the San Joaquin River, CA, as well as the Truckee River, NV, channels. Funding for this operation would be obtained from available balances from the $137 million appropriated by the Senate for operations and maintenance for corps navigation projects. 
I had previously requested $10 million for this operation for about 20 sites along the San Joaquin River, which filled with debris and sediment from the January 1997 floods in California. As a result of this flooding, the capacity of the San Joaquin was severely diminished and poses a threat of continued flooding before the flood season is over. The scope of this debris and fill was not evident until the river flows had receded. At that point, however, the emergency authority for corps' clearing operations had passed. 
The hazard to navigation and to flooding posed by the debris fill is now quite obvious. What is less obvious is the obstruction that the deposited debris and sediment created to the migration and passage of anadramous and other fish, some of which are federally listed as endangered or threatened. 
I appreciate Senators Stevens' and Reid's help on this amendment and urge their continued support for this provision when we conference with the House.

Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today I introduce legislation to ensure that children across the country will not lose special education funds provided by the Individual With Disabilities Education Act or IDEA. My legislation will fix a loophole in IDEA that threatens to cut off special education funding to children in California and as many as 24 other States. 
IDEA guarantees all children a `free and appropriate public education.' Unfortunately, the Department of Education has interpreted this requirement with a bizarre twist. It has insisted that `all children' includes those felons who, because of the particularly violent nature of their crimes, are serving time in adult State prisons. The Department of Education has even insisted California provide special education classes to two murderers on death row. If California refuses to comply, it stands to loss all Federal funding for special education--over $330 million, which helps educate close to 600,000 children. 
I believe California is correct to protest these guidelines. 
To hold special education children hostage to juvenile murderers and rapists in the State's adult prison system is unconscionable. The $5 to $20 million it would cost to provide specialized classes for these violent felons would clearly be better spent on law-abiding citizens. 
My colleagues should be aware that California is not alone in this predicament. Twenty-four other states have been cited for noncompliance with IDEA's prison mandate, and they may lose Federal special education aid if they fail to change their policies. 
My bill would amend IDEA to clarify that those juveniles sent to adult prisons because of the violent nature of their crimes would not be subject to the IDEA special education requirement. Young adults housed in juvenile detention facilities will not be affected in any way. 
This bill will not prohibit or hinder in any way a State's ability to provide special education to adult prisoners. It will only remove the Federal mandate requiring States to provide special education to juveniles remanded to adult prisons. Deciding which rehabilitation programs to provide to State prisoners properly rests with lawmakers in each State. States such as California should not have to fear the loss of critical Federal aid because they prefer to allocate scarce resources to educate noncriminals. 
Mr. President, this is a commonsense proposal, and I hope the Senate will act on it expeditiously.

Mrs. BOXER. Thank you. 
I will be very brief. 
Mr. President, I served in the House of Representatives for 10 years, and I served on the Budget Committee for 6 years during that time. I now serve on the Budget Committee and happen to be on the Appropriations Committee as well. And since the Senator from Texas wants to learn from history, let me share some history with her. 
In all those years on the Budget Committee--it is actually 11 in all; 6 in the House, 5 in the Senate--I have never seen the majority party, whether it was Republican or Democrat, not put forward a budget. I have never seen such a dereliction of duty. I miss my Budget Committee chairman. I want to send him a card: `Looking forward to seeing you.' 
I like working with Chairman Pete Domenici. We do not even meet anymore, Mr. President. We are not doing our work. And now on an emergency supplemental bill, where the people who have been suffering are counting on us, we move a piece of legislation on to that bill that has nothing to do with a natural disaster, that has to do with a budgetary fight which is an admission of surrender by the people who are offering it that they cannot play by the rules of the game, by the laws of this Congress which say you must have a budget on the floor by April 15. 
And then to come to the floor and criticize the Senator from North Dakota, who has been working, as I have, with our Republican friends, with our Democratic friends, to craft an emergency bill that is fiscally responsible, that meets the needs of people, to have my friend from North Dakota attacked as not being empathetic to the needs of this country, to me, is beyond repair. 
We have two jobs to do today. We have to pass an emergency supplemental appropriations to help the people of California, to help the people of North Dakota, indeed, to help the people of 22 States who have suffered, who have lost their homes, their businesses, who were evacuated--we have to do that--and we have to do it fast. We have to help our farmers, our small businesspeople. 
I do not think I will ever forget the vision of that city in North Dakota that is a ghost town. It just looked like 
something out of a picture out of World War II--burning buildings sitting in water. And we are putting our budget battle on to this emergency bill. And I just have to say, I am so surprised that this has occurred. It did not happen on the House side. 
Our chairman, Chairman Stevens, called off the hearing--the markup--after telling us that he was prepared to go forward with a clean bill but others wanted this added. In respect to his colleagues, of course, he did the right thing, called off the markup. 
So I hope we can come together as Democrats and Republicans. That is what the people want us to do. And let us do our job. Let us get these people the help they need. 
There are other amendments now on there, environmental amendments that totally eviscerate environmental laws that should not be part of this bill. 
There is a labor fight going on about how much you pay workers at construction projects. That has now gotten on to this emergency bill. 
We have procedures here. We have processes here to deal with these other matters. So I am hoping we do two things today: We pass a clean bill in the committee, and we are going to go to that markup at 2 o'clock; and, second, we ask our colleagues on the Budget Committee, `Put your budget on the table before you try to resort to across-the-board cuts.' 
And I want to correct the record on this point. My friend from Texas made a point that in actuality this continuing resolution is going to be a level of spending higher than the President suggested. Now, this may be true for the overall number, but I can assure my friend, he has an initiative in education, he has an initiative in children's health, he has an initiative to clean up Superfund sites, he has an initiative on crime. This President has initiatives in his budget. So if you just go ahead and say, well, we have decided to forget about our free markup budget, and throw in the towel, and put this solution down on the table----

Mrs. BOXER. Put this 2-percent solution on the table and indicate to the President that there will not be severe cuts in education, the environment, in crime, in health research, that is simply not true. 
As a matter of fact, our analysis that we have done thus far--and we are still working on it--shows in some cases a 7-, 8-, 9-percent reduction that will result in young people not having Pell grants, kids not getting into Head Start, Superfund sites being delayed, veterans benefits being delayed, if that 2-percent solution goes forward. 
I hope we can have that debate another day.

You asked me, did I not think it would be more responsible for the President to stick to last year's budget? No, absolutely not. Maybe the Senator has forgotten, we had an election, and this President won. Do you know what the election was about? It was about how much you ought to cut Medicare, how much you ought to spend on the environment, how much you ought to spend on education, how many more cops we should put on the beat. We had the election and the American people chose this President. 
I am answering your question.

Mrs. BOXER. Let me finish. The Senator is asking what is responsible. 
It would be irresponsible for this President to back down on what he said he would do for the American people. I know there are some of my colleagues who do not agree with this President, who do not want to spend more on education, who do not want to spend more cleaning up the environment, who want to cut more out of Medicare, who would like to give tax breaks to the very wealthiest. 
That is a fair debate, I say to my friend. This is a debate about budget priorities. 
What I think would be responsible for this President is to stick with the promises he made in his campaign to the American people. 
The second thing I think would be responsible for us is to keep this emergency supplemental appropriation clean of this budget battle. I think the American people can see in the debate between the Senator from Texas and myself, in the remarks that were made by the Senator from Arizona, that the budget battle is a very heartfelt battle. As a matter of fact, it differentiates the parties. So what is responsible for this President, it seems to me, is to get this emergency supplemental to the people, clean of these other amendments, and what is responsible for this U.S. Senate is to produce a budget and do our work. 
Mr. President, I am thoroughly convinced if we do that, we do not need a 2-percent gimmick. We can have a real budget debate and a real balanced budget for the people of this country. 
I yield the floor. 
Mr. DORGAN addressed the Chair.

<TEXT>
Mrs. BOXER. Thank you very much. 
I appreciate my friend from Connecticut allowing me to proceed. I may not use the full 7 minutes. I will try to be very concise. 
Mr. President, I rise in strong support for ratification of the Chemical Weapons Convention. And I base my support on four main facts. 
First, the Chemical Weapons Convention is in the national security interests of the United States of America because it reduces the likelihood that American soldiers or civilians will ever face a chemical weapons attack. 
We should not lose sight of why this is so important. The effects of chemical weapons are so barbaric, so devastating, that we must do all we can to ensure that they are never used again. 
Chemical weapons are among the most horrible devices ever conceived. If they do not kill their victims instantly, chemical weapons invade the respiratory system making it unbearably painful to breathe. When chemical weapons were used in Iraq by Saddam Hussein, against the Kurds, eyewitnesses reported that the pain was so great that many victims submerged themselves in nearby rivers to escape the spreading gas. 
Mr. President, we are a civilized Nation here. We must do all we can to prevent this torture. And approving the CWC is a major step. I know many of my colleagues had questions. I know that Senator Biden and others have worked tirelessly to address those problems. And I feel what we will have before us, if we defeat the killer amendments, the five killer amendments, will lead us to a far more civilized world. 
All signatory nations of the CWC agree never again to manufacture chemical weapons, nor to use them in war. They agree to destroy all existing stockpiles of chemical weapons. They agree to allow inspections of chemical plants to verify that no weapons are being manufactured illegally. 
To those who say there are some nations who may not sign on, we know that is so. I will say this: If we sign this treaty and we are a party to it, it will be far more difficult for nonsignatory nations to develop chemical weapons. This is the case because rogue states will find it far more difficult to import the raw materials and manufacturing equipment they need to develop chemical weapons. 
Another reason, the second reason: If the United States fails to ratify the convention, it will still go into effect, but it will be weaker. It will be weaker because many nations will stay off this treaty and, therefore, there will be fewer who are actually bound by it. Also, our inspectors will not be on the team to go and search for possible CWC violations. Our inspectors are among the best in the world, and they will give us confidence as to the true state of chemical weapons production. Why would we want to stay off a treaty that will go forward that will not have our inspectors on those teams? 
Third, failure to ratify will hurt American business. The CWC imposes trade sanctions against nonsignatory nations that limit the ability of their chemical industries to export many of their products overseas. It could cost our companies hundreds of millions of dollars every year. Now, opponents say that the CWC would impose additional regulations on an already heavily regulated industry, our chemical industry. They argue the convention will result in vast new compliance costs. But when you take the compliance costs of $250,000 to $2 million for the entire industry, that is a small price to pay compared to the hundreds of millions of dollars that would be lost if sanctions were imposed. 
The vast majority of the chemical industries strongly supports the CWC. U.S. chemical companies advised the Reagan and Bush administrations throughout the original CWC negotiations. Leading U.S. chemical trade associations support the CWC. They know the costs of compliance are small and the risks to industry are great if we fail to ratify. 
Fourth, failure to ratify will undermine our credibility, America's credibility, in the world. Imagine a treaty that was brought forward by Ronald Reagan, continued toward the goal line by George Bush, and now a Democrat President, following a legacy of those two Republican Presidents, wanting to take this over the goal line, and suddenly we are going to back off. It seems to me our credibility is absolutely at stake here. I believe we should not back away from this treaty. We should pass it and defeat the killer amendments. 
Mr. President, to those who raise all sorts of flags about this treaty, we should understand this: We could always exercise our right to withdraw from the convention on 90 days' notice. This right to withdraw is guaranteed to all signatory nations by article XVI of the CWC. 
Mr. President, in closing, I thank the Senator from Vermont for his generosity, and my friend from Connecticut. I join with them. The CWC is in our national interests. It will enhance national security, protect American jobs; it will help maintain our position of global leadership; and, my friends, most important of all, it really will protect the world from the most horrible, horrible weapons of our time.

 Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise today to observe the 82d anniversary of the Armenian genocide. It is only by keeping the memory of this dark time alive will we keep it from occurring again. 
On April 24, 1915, over 200 Armenian religious, political and intellectual leaders were arrested in Constantinople--now Istanbul--and killed, marking the beginning of an organized campaign to eliminate the Armenian presence from the Ottoman Empire. 
Thousands of Armenians were subjected to torture, deportation, slavery and ultimately, murder. In the 8 years between 1915 and 1923, roughly 1.5 million men, women and children lost their lives to this genocide. More than 500,000 were removed from their homeland, many of whom perished in forced marches ending in the deserts of Syria. 
The Armenians were able to gain their freedom for a short time in 1918, but in 1920, when the former Soviet Union joined the Turkish attack, they were again overpowered. It was only in 1991, following the breakup of the Soviet Union, that the new Republic of Armenia was born. Today, we pay tribute to the courage and strength of a people who would not know defeat. 
Yet, independence has not meant an end to their struggle. There are still those who question the reality of the Armenian slaughter. There are those who have failed to recognize its very existence. But we must not allow the horror of the Armenian genocide to be either diminished or denied. 
The pages of history are replete with stories of the atrocities man commits against his fellow man. And upon those pages, this massacre is one of the most vile stains. We must learn the lessons of the past well, and never tire of the fight to end prejudice and discrimination. We must show the world the Armenian people did not suffer in vain.

 Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I would like to pay tribute today and commemorate the 125th anniversary of the First African Methodist Episcopal Church in Los Angeles, CA. First A.M.E., as it is known to millions of southern Californians, is the oldest predominately African-American church in Los Angeles. For the past 20 years, First A.M.E. has been led by the Reverend Cecil L. `Chip' Murray, who has distinguished himself as one of the leading black clergymen in America during his tenure at this church. 
This year's anniversary celebration is about much more than longevity. It is about a legacy of and commitment to leadership and inspiration. First A.M.E. is not only the oldest and most well-known African-American church in Los Angeles, it is also the most highly respected. Its reputation as a place of worship and a center of black community fellowship and action is known to Angelenos of every social and ethnic background. Its voice has been an essential part of a city known for dynamic civic dialog. 
In addition to its central role as a church, First A.M.E. also provides much-needed leadership and social service assistance in the community. Church outreach efforts include providing food and housing assistance to families and individuals in need, job training and placement services and working with young people to encourage them along the paths of personal and spiritual fulfillment and social responsibility. Although its focus is primarily local, First A.M.E. has also hosted leaders of national and international stature at its Sunday services. In so doing, First A.M.E. has provided a valuable forum, which has stimulated dialog and action in the community. 
One-hundred and twenty-five years ago, a former slave, Biddy Mason, founded the First A.M.E. in her home in what is now downtown Los Angeles. Today, the congregation worships in a beautiful building designed by the renowned black architect Paul Williams. When the first service was held there were only 12 people in attendance. When I was there last year, there were over 600 people at just one service, and there were several held that day. 
The Reverend Chip Murray joined First A.M.E. in 1977, when the congregation had but 300 active members. Today, this number has increased to over 9,000, representing all age ranges and every socioeconomic group in Los Angeles' diverse African-American community. Under Reverend Murray's leadership, First A.M.E. has developed 30 task forces that focus on such issues as health, substance abuse, aid to needy families and the elderly, housing and economic development, job training, and tutoring. I cannot say enough about First A.M.E.'s efforts to reach out to people from all walks of life. 
Reverend Murray's mission has been to expand the church beyond its walls. As an example, every new congregant is asked to participate in a task force. Efforts such as this help ensure that First A.M.E. remains intimately involved in the life and times of the great city which it serves. Because of this dedication to public service, Reverend Murray and First A.M.E. have become beacons of hope and inspiration in a city where all too often fear and despair prevail. Their hard work and boundless decency represent well the power of faith leavened with action.

Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today I introduce the Children's Environmental Protection Act [CEPA]. This legislation will help protect our children from the harmful effects of environmental pollutants. The Children's Environmental Protection Act will do three things: 
First, it will require that all EPA standards be set at levels that protect children, and other vulnerable groups, including the elderly, pregnant women, people with serious health problems, and others. 
Second, it will create a list of EPA-recommended safer-for-children products and chemicals that minimize potential risks to children. Within 1 year, only these products could be used at Federal facilities. CEPA will also require the EPA to create a family right-to-know information kit that includes practical suggestions on how parents may reduce their children's exposure to environmental pollutants. 
For example, newborns and infants frequently spend long periods of time on the floor, carpet, or grass, surfaces that are associated with chemicals such as formaldehyde and volatile organic compounds from synthetic carpets and indoor and outdoor pesticide applications. EPA might suggest safer-for-children carpeting, floor cleaning products, and garden pesticides. 
Finally, the bill will require EPA to conduct research on the health effects of exposure of children to environmental pollutants. 
Our children face unique environmental threats to their health because they are more vulnerable to exposure to toxic chemicals than adults. We must educate ourselves about environmental pollutants, and we must improve our scientific understanding about how exposure might affect our children's health. 
We took an important step in this direction when the Safe Drinking Water Act was passed last year. The new law includes two amendments I supported and worked to enact. The first requires that safe drinking water standards be set at levels that protect children, the elderly, pregnant women, and other vulnerable groups. The second requires that the public receive information in the form of Consumer Confidence Reports about the quality and safety of their drinking water. 
The Children's Environmental Protection Act [CEPA] will carry the concept of my Safe Drinking Water Act amendments even further. 
Children are not just little adults. According to the National Academy of Sciences, they are more vulnerable than adults. They eat more food, drink more water, and breathe more air as a percentage of their body weight than adults, and as a consequence, they are more exposed to the chemicals present in food, water, and air. Children are also growing and developing and may therefore be physiologically more susceptible than adults to the hazards associated with exposures to chemicals. 
We have clear evidence that environmental pollution has a direct impact on children's health. Air pollution is linked to the 40-percent increase in the incidence of childhood asthma and the 118 percent increase asthma deaths among children and young people since 1980. Asthma now affects over 4.2 million children under the age of 18 nationwide and is the leading cause of hospital admissions for children. The incidence of some types of childhood cancer has risen significantly over the past 15 years. For example, acute lymphocytic leukemia is up 10 percent and brain tumors are up more than 30 percent. 
Children may face developmental risks from the potential effects of exposure to pesticides and industrial chemicals on their endocrine systems. 
Exposure to environmental pollutants is suspected of being responsible for the increase in learning disabilities and attention deficit disorders among children. 
What are we doing in response to this evidence? Not enough. We know that up to one-half of a person's lifetime cancer risk may be incurred in the first 6 years of life, yet most of our Federal health and safety standards are not set at levels that are protective of children. 
I am very pleased with the Environmental Protection Agency's recent creation of a new Office of Children's Health Protection in the Office of the Administrator, and a new EPA Board on Children's Environmental Health. 
We need Federal legislation in order to secure the EPA's administrative efforts and give EPA support and direction.

Mrs. BOXER. I will be brief. But I just wanted to thank the Senator from Illinois for, in his very direct way, putting this issue before the American people. The Senator and I served on the Budget Committee in the House of Representatives for many years. And I serve here on the Budget Committee. I have never seen a situation like this before. The Senator talked about the no budget no pay legislation. While he was fighting for that in the House, I was here in the Senate fighting for that as well; and some of us over here gave our pay to charity during that period. 
I know that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle do not want to have another Government shutdown. As a matter of fact, some of them are going to introduce legislation to pass a permanent continuing resolution and avoid such a shutdown. Frankly, I am glad they are thinking along the lines of avoiding a shutdown. But that really begs the question of the day. That is the cowardly way out. If we cannot get our act together, we admit it now, we are introducing legislation to just keep the Government going at the old rate even though, by the way, things are changing and we need to react to what the people want. But they will continue it going to avoid the heat of a Government shutdown. 
The fact is, where is the budget? Tonight, late at night, there will be a rush at mailboxes all across this country of people mailing in their tax returns. They have to get an extension if they do not meet the deadline. Where is this extension? I have yet to see a budget. 
In my closing remarks to the Senator from Illinois, I say to him, does he remember anything quite like this? I know some deadlines have been missed in the past, but in my memory, that does go back a ways. At least we had a budget out there. We may not have dotted all the i's, crossed all the t's, and come to a conclusion by this time, but we always had that budget document out there. 
Where we stand today is the President has a budget document out there. It balances by the year 2002, according to the Congressional Budget Office. The Republicans do not like that budget. Fair enough. That is why they are Republicans. They have different values. They do not want to see the increases in education. They do not want to see the increases for the environment. They want to give tax breaks to the very wealthy while the President is targeting those tax breaks to middle-class people who need help sending their kids to college, and so on. So that is fair game. 
But now I want to see their budget. That is what they have to do. That is their responsibility. They keep saying they want a balanced budget amendment, as my friend said. That did not do anything to balance the budget. It was just a lot of rhetoric, and some of us said that at the time. Where is your plan? The fact is, without one Republican vote we have seen this deficit go down from $290 billion to what is it now projected to be, $91 billion? That is an extraordinary record of accomplishment. 
So all we are saying here in our own way, it seems to me, and what the Senator is saying--and I would ask for his comment --is we have never seen a situation where the majority party was so afraid to offer a budget; we have never seen a situation where they did not have the courage to lay down their priorities. I wonder if my friend agrees, if this is really an unprecedented situation?

Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, it is an honor for me to join today with four of the giants of the first ISTEA--Senators Moynihan, Chafee, Lautenberg, and Lieberman to support the ISTEA Reauthorization Act, the reauthorization of the 1991 Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act. Their vision of how we should shape transportation in this country in the postinterstate era is why we are here today to carry that vision into the next century. 
The economic power of California and this Nation can only be unleashed if we invest in the means to get our workers to their jobs and our exports into international trade. This legislation not only will accomplish that vital goal but it will do so without leaving our environment in worst shape for generations to come. 
At this time, Senator Moynihan's bill best meets the goals that I have set for rewriting our surface transportation law. It is the best approach for California, which contributes more in Federal gas taxes than any other State. While this legislation is not what I will expect in a final bill, it is the best horse for California out of the starting gate. 
I look forward to working with colleagues in committee to add provisions important to my State, including adding my legislation to provide Federal investment in border infrastructure to relieve border choke points resulting from increased trade. Senator Moynihan knows this is a key issue for the border States. 
Let me tell you briefly why this bill is the best for California right now: 
First and foremost, this bill recognizes the responsibility that transportation bears to environmental protection by preserving the Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality Program. Nearly 26 million of California's 33 million residents live in an area that fails to meet one or more of the EPA's air quality standards. CMAQ must be preserved as a separate program targeted to those areas that need alternative transportation choices. 
The bill also anticipates the adoption of new standards that will increase CMAQ funding for new nonattainment areas while protecting the funding levels of current areas. In addition, the bill preserves funding for areas that are in maintenance status, a measure that I authored in the 1995 National Highway System Designation Act to help these areas continue their path toward improved air quality. 
Second, the bill uses up to date factors such as actual vehicle use and current population estimates in determining the highway funding categories. Those factors help raise California's share of funding. I will continue to work with my colleagues in the committee for a fairer share of the transportation funds for California, but this is a good start. 
Third, the bill continues the Bridge Rehabilitation and Repair Program. In 1994, after the Northridge disaster, my colleagues here supported my bill that permitted this program to fund seismic retrofit projects without needing some other kind of repair first. This program is unique in that it permits such funding for local bridges. 
Last, but not least, this bill carries the torch for the basic framework of ISTEA. I have heard from my local governments north to south in California that ISTEA works. Some change, yes. But the basic integrity of this law is sound. I agree with them, and I am proud to join the `ISTEA works team.'

 Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise today in real sadness to report to my colleagues about the senseless murder last Thursday of Scott Williams, a decorated correctional officer at the Lompoc Federal Penitentiary. 
Scott was just 29 years old when he was attacked savagely by an inmate with a makeshift knife. The stabbing occurred during a time of day when inmates walk freely through Lompoc's corridors. He is the only officer killed in the line of duty in the prison's history. My heart goes out to the family Scott Williams leaves behind--to his wife, Kristy, and their two young daughters, Kaitlin and Kallie. 
Scott was a model officer, much admired by his colleagues at Lompoc, where he had been employed for only 4 years. But in those 4 years this young man had been promoted once and had received six awards for outstanding service. Scott Williams was as admired for his professionalism and commitment to duty as he was for his kind manner. 
Sadly, Scott's training and commitment were not enough to sustain him in the terrifying and deadly moments of the attack, for he was unarmed. Four other officers--Mark Stephenson, Marcos Marquez, Scott Ledham, and Scot Elliott--were injured as they rushed to his side and finally subdued the attacker. 
This tragic episode highlights the very real dangers that confront correctional officers across the country. And such incidents are on the rise throughout the Federal prison system. Nowhere is the record for attacks on guards worse than at Lompoc. 
Few of us can appreciate the perils faced daily by our correctional officers. The job is fraught with danger, and it takes a special person to come through each day with one's spirit and confidence intact. But Scott Williams was such a man, and now his family and friends must go on without him. 
I grieve for the family that is no more: for the husband and wife who can no longer dream of growing old together, for the young daughters denied a lifetime of their father's love and affection. I grieve for the people of Lompoc, and Los Alamos--Scott's hometown, still stunned and shocked by this murder in their midst. 
I intend to initiate some inquiries concerning the appropriate way to prevent such acts of senseless savagery from happening in the future. As a proper testament to the life of Officer Scott Williams, it is incumbent upon us to do no less.

 Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Rolland Lowe, M.D., who was installed on March 24 as the 132d president of the California Medical Association, the largest State medical association. He is the first Asian-American president in its history and has earned my admiration on both a personal and professional level. 
Dr. Lowe has built an extraordinary list of achievements throughout his career. He has served as the chief of surgery and chief of staff at the Chinese Hospital in San Francisco, working to ensure high-quality health care for low-income immigrants. He currently holds a position as a member on the board of trustees for the hospital and is the former chair. 
Dr. Lowe has served as president of the San Francisco Medical Society in addition to serving on the California Medical Association's board of trustees since 1987. 
In addition to distinguishing himself in his career, Dr. Lowe has been a role model for the community through his philanthropic work and community activism. He serves on dozens of the boards of organizations. He also has founded and currently is the chair of the Lawrence Choy Lowe Memorial Fund in Chinatown. 
I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing Dr. Lowe for his commitment to the people of San Francisco and congratulating him on this achievement.

Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, on February 28, the administration, pursuant to the requirement of the international narcotics trafficking statute, made a decision regarding our Nation's fight against illegal drug trafficking. The decision was made to certify that Mexico has, in the past year, taken all appropriate and necessary actions in the fight against international narcotics trafficking. 
I respectfully disagree with this decision, and I would like to explain why. 
Under our international narcotics trafficking statutes, in order for a country which is known to be either a major source of narcotics or a major drug transit country to continue to receive U.S. aid, the President must certify by March 1 that the country is either performing adequately in cooperating with the United States or is taking steps on its own in the fight against international narcotics trafficking. 
The law gives the administration three choices: 
First, certification that the country is either fully cooperating with the United States or has taken adequate steps on its own to combat the narcotics trade. 
Second, decertification of the country, concluding that the country has failed to meet the requirements of cooperation or action. 
Third, no certification, but a vital national interest waiver--essentially a finding that the country has not met the standards of the law, but that our own national interests are best protected by continuing to provide assistance to the country. 
The question of Mexico is complicated. Mexico is the leading transit country for cocaine coming into the United States: 50 to 70 percent of all cocaine shipped into the United States comes through Mexico. It is also a significant source of heroin, methamphetamines, and marijuana. 
President Zedillo seems to be strongly committed to rid the Mexican law enforcement system of corruption and to fight the Mexican drug cartels. However, the reports and events of the past few weeks have made it clear that corruption in police ranks--even up to the very top ranks--is still rampant in Mexico. 
Just a few weeks ago, it was revealed that the man hired to be Mexico's drug czar--the head of their anti-narcotics agency--was fired abruptly after being accused of taking bribes from one of Mexico's most powerful drug lords. 
It would be as if our own drug czar, Gen. Barry McCaffrey, were found to be in league with drug gangs in our country. Why didn't the Mexican Government tell us they were investigating their drug czar? Why did they let our own drug agency brief him and give him important intelligence about our antidrug efforts? I do not call that cooperation. 
Mexico has also failed to take its own steps to meet the standards of the certification law. It has not acted boldly to root out corruption in its law enforcement establishment; it has extradited to the United States only a few Mexican nationals suspected of involvement in United States drug activities; it has failed to implement new anticrime laws enacted last year. 
Given these facts, I do not believe Mexico qualifies to be certified in full compliance with the drug law. I do believe that the President would have been justified in granting a vital national interest waiver for Mexico so that sanctions would not have to be applied, and I wish that he had followed that course. 
Granting a waiver would send a message to Mexico that its actions in the past year were inadequate, but it 
would also allow the United States to continue its efforts to work with President Zedillo and others in his administration who are committed to the drug fight. Unfortunately, our parliamentary procedures do not permit a vote on such a measure, because that is not what the President supported. 
The resolution before the Senate today makes some good points. It finds that, in several areas, Mexico's actions against narcotics trafficking have been inadequate: 
First, evidence of significant corruption among Mexican officials, especially law enforcement; 
Second, Mexico's failure to fully implement new anti-money laundering laws; 
Third, drug cartels operating with impunity in Mexico; 
Fourth, Mexico's failure to grant our extradition requests concerning Mexican nationals who have been indicted in United States courts; and 
Fifth, decline in the number of cocaine seizures and arrests of drug traffickers in Mexico in the past few years. 
These findings put Congress on record stating that Mexico is not doing enough to fight narcotics trafficking or to cooperate with the United States in doing so. 
In addition to the findings, there is a sense of the Congress section stating that there has not been enough progress in halting the production in and transit through Mexico of illegal drugs. 
The meat of the resolution is contained in subsection (d), which requires the President, by September 1, to submit a report to Congress on the extent of progress made by the United States and Mexico in ten areas: 
First, bringing down the drug cartels; 
Second, strengthening United States/Mexico law enforcement cooperative efforts; 
Third, strengthening bilateral border enforcement; 
Fourth, improvement of extradition matters between the United States and Mexico; 
Fifth, simplifying evidentiary requirements for narcotics and related crimes; 
Sixth, full implementation of money laundering laws; 
Seventh, Crop eradication; 
Eighth, screening backgrounds of law enforcement officials; 
Ninth, increasing support for Mexico's efforts to prosecute corrupt public officials; and 
Tenth, strengthening overall bilateral cooperation. 
The resolution does not specify a process for congressional review of the President's report. However, as Senator Feinstein said earlier, many of us will be keenly interested in the details of the report, and of course, Congress may respond in any way it deems appropriate. 
So I conclude that while this resolution is not what I had hoped to vote for, I must support it, as it is the only vehicle we will have on which to make a statement concerning the Mexico drug certification question. 
Finally, Mr. President, I would like to speak briefly on another subject concerning our relationship with Mexico. That is the United States embargo against Mexican tuna and the efforts by some, including the Mexican Government, to lift this embargo. 
The current embargo--which was imposed in 1990 against all countries that do not have environmental policies that protect dolphins from unsafe tuna fishing practices--prohibits Mexican tuna vessels from selling their products in the United States market. 
Lifting the embargo would undoubtedly lead to an increase in the number of Mexican vessels operating in the eastern tropical Pacific. I believe that, given the current power and reach of the drug cartels in Latin America--particularly Colombia and Mexico--and their frequent reliance on maritime vessels to make drug shipments, now is not the time to open up a whole new avenue of maritime trade from Mexico. 
Cartels are using fishing boats and cargo ships more and more often to smuggle cocaine from Colombia to Mexico where it is then shifted to trucks and other vehicles for transport across the border into the United States. 
The risk of capture for these vessels is low in an ocean so large. And even when the ships are stopped, it is hard for law enforcement to find the drugs, which are hidden in secret compartments. Many fishing vessels have sophisticated radar equipment that allows them to keep ahead of law enforcement. 
According to an article in the January 30 Washington Post, our own Coast Guard admits that the eastern Pacific is `one of the most difficult places for us to interdict drug shipments. It's a vast ocean. There are no choke points, no places to hide and lots of places to search--including 2,000 miles of coast.' 
So why, at this time when narcotics trafficking in and through Mexico into the United States is threatening to undermine our two countries' relationship, would we deliberately make it harder to bring these cartels under control?

Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am today introducing a bill that will authorize emergency appropriations for cleanup and repair of damages to facilities of Yosemite National Park and other National Park Service areas in California caused by heavy rains and flooding in December 1996 and January 1997. 
I expect most of the issues regarding emergency cleanup and repair due to floods in California to be addressed through the appropriations process. I do not therefore expect this bill to be taken up by the appropriate Senate committee and passed by the Senate. The primary purpose of introducing this bill is to set a benchmark for recovery and cleanup efforts at Yosemite National Park. 
My bill takes several steps beyond the bill that was introduced last month by Congressman Doolittle and Radanovich: 
First, it authorizes emergency funding. Second, it authorizes a specific amount--$200 million in emergency funds in fiscal year 1997. Third, it specifies that funds shall only be spent in a manner that is consistent with the Yosemite general management plan, the concession services plan, and when adopted, the Yosemite Valley housing plan, and the valley implementation plan. Fourth, it specifies that funds spent on repair and rebuilding of concessions facilities shall be recovered by the Secretary of the Interior to the greatest extent practicable according to the Department of the Interior's contract with the concessioner. Fifth, it authorizes emergency grants to satellite communities around Yosemite to provide mass transit visitor transportation into the park during repair and restoration activities on access roads. Sixth, it authorizes emergency appropriations for other California parks that suffered flood damage including Redwood National Park, Sequoia-Kings Canyon National Park, and others. Seventh, it authorizes $7 million to be appropriated in fiscal year 1998 and such sums as may be necessary for each fiscal year thereafter for a mass transit system for Yosemite. 
Mr. President, the primary goal of the emergency restoration and construction activities authorized in this bill is to reopen Yosemite National Park and restore services to Park visitors as quickly and safely as possible. 
The importance of emergency funding for Yosemite cannot be overstated. It is a unique national treasure, recognized all over the world for its spectacular natural beauty. Over 1.4 million people visit the park every year including tens of thousands of international visitors who travel to California for the sole purpose of staying in the park to experience nature. John Muir--one of our nation's founding leaders of 
environmental conservation--first encountered the majestic Yosemite Valley in 1864 and immediately realized the importance of preserving its natural wonders. Muir's foresight and passion resulted in the establishment of Yosemite National Park in October 1890. At its onset, the park included 60,000 acres miles of scenic wild lands. Today, some 106 years later, the park embraces over 761,236 acres of granite peaks, broad meadows, glacially carved domes, giant sequoias, secluded tarns, and breathtaking waterfalls. 
This winter, tropical storms with heavy rain caused serious flooding in the park. Yosemite's major rivers and tributaries flooded many park areas and caused severe damage to infrastructure. Over 350 damage assessments have been completed by engineers, architects, resource specialists, and other technical experts. Their first damage assessment report shows serious damage to the four main routes leading into the park, major electrical and sewer systems, 224 units of employee housing, over 500 guest lodging units, over 350 campsites, 17 restoration projects, and over 10 archeological sites. 
According to the National Park Service, full recovery will take years. We now begin the recovery period during which, interim solutions will be put in place such as temporary housing and lodging while permanent construction is being completed. 
The Yosemite Emergency Restoration and Reconstruction Act would authorize $200 million in emergency funds to be appropriated to the Secretary of Interior for cleanup and repair of flood damages to the facilities of Yosemite National Park caused by heavy rains and flooding in December 1996 and January 1997, and other national parks in the State of California. The funds are authorized to remain available until expended. 
The authorization requires that any emergency funds spent at Yosemite be consistent with the Yosemite General Management Plan, the Concession Services Plan, and when adopted, the Yosemite Valley Housing Plan, and the Valley Implementation Plan. 
Funds are authorized to be spent on repair, restoration, and relocation, where appropriate, of infrastructure vital to Yosemite National Park operations, including but not limited to roads, trails, utilities, buildings, grounds--including campgrounds--natural resources, cultural resources, and lost and damaged property, both within the park boundaries and at the El Portal administrative site servicing the park. 
Also, funds are authorized to repair and relocation of park employee housing and the Resource Management Office; repair, maintenance, and opening of Tioga Pass Road within the boundaries of the park; and repair and expeditious opening of highways 120, 140, and 41 within the boundaries of the park. 
The bill requires that funds spent on repair and relocation of concession-operated rental cabins, motel rooms, rental structures, and concession employee housing and facilities be recovered by the Department of the Interior to the greatest extent practicable, within the provisions of the concession contract between the Department of the Interior and the Yosemite Concession Services. 
Mr. President, a key aspect to the bill is the authorization of $2.5 million in emergency grants to satellite communities around Yosemite National Park for the purpose of providing mass transit visitor transportation into the park during repair and restoration activities on access roads to the park. 
Other California parks suffered flood damage. My bill would authorize emergency funds for Redwood National Park, Sequoia-Kings Canyon National Park, Lassen Volcanic National Park, Whiskeytown National Recreation Area, Devils Postpile National Monument, and Lava Beds National Monument. 
Last, Mr. President, my bill authorizes $7 million to be appropriated in fiscal year 1998 and such sums as may be necessary for each fiscal year thereafter to the Secretary of Interior for the purpose of helping establish a mass transit system for Yosemite National Park--specifically for the purchase of electric buses and alternative-fueled buses.

Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am proud to stand with Senator Hollings and Senator Byrd and many other Senators today in support of Senate Joint Resolution 18. This measure proposes a constitutional amendment to allow the Congress to limit the amount of money that is spent on campaigns. I treasure the Constitution of the United States of America and never have I stood on the floor of the Congress supporting such a measure, except for the equal rights amendment and this measure. It is very rare that I stand to amend this Constitution. But we are about to lose our democracy. It is that serious. I think what Senator Hollings has come up with here is a way to save this democracy. So, I am so proud to be a cosponsor of his measure. 
Total campaign spending for general election congressional races has increased more than sixfold in the past 20 years. The total amount of money raised by Republicans and Democrats in 1996 was almost $900 million. In my own reelection campaign, I believe that it could cost at least $20 million. I come from California. We have 33 million people. And $20 million would actually be less than what was spent several years ago to win a U.S. Senate seat. It is an unbelievable amount. 
So it is undeniable that there is an extraordinary amount of money in political campaigns. The amounts are growing and unfortunately, in my view, some partisan observers of our political system do not even see it as a problem. I have heard responses such as, `So what?' Or, `Money is the American way.' Or `The problem isn't too much money, it is too little money.' And the most ludicrous I thought, `We spend more advertising dollars on yogurt than we do on campaigns.' I strongly disagree with the notion that money in politics is not a problem. It is a serious problem, undermining our democracy, depressing voter turnout, and, frankly, depressing the American people who should be depressed that their elected officials have to spend so much time away from their official duties. 
Let me talk about the California race. Today, a Senate candidate in California can expect to have to raise up to $10,000 a day, including Saturday and Sunday, 365 days a year, for 6 full years. Imagine, $10,000 a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year, for a full 6 years. That is too much time away from work, too much time away from doing the kinds of things that we want to do here, making life better for people. I resent it. And I am so proud to be able to support this constitutional amendment. Anyone who supports reform, therefore, has to support this. Because of the Supreme Court decision, we cannot control spending unless we pass this Hollings amendment. The Supreme Court decision discriminates against potential candidates who do not have a lot of personal wealth. The talent pool for the House and Senate is declining because of the amount of money that is needed to be raised. 
I want to talk a minute about the Supreme Court decision--which I know my colleagues, who are attorneys, who understand it, perhaps, in a deeper fashion, have already done--but I want to talk about it from a commonsense point of view, and as someone who loves this Constitution. I think the Supreme Court was just completely wrong on this Buckley versus Valeo decision that said that Congress could not put a cap on campaign spending. Freedom of speech is the most precious and most important of all the rights guaranteed in our Constitution. But, it seems to me, if you equate money with speech you are demeaning speech. You are demeaning speech. Not everything can be equated with the dollar. Free speech goes far beyond that. And what about the speech of the candidates who do not have personal wealth? What about their speech? When someone comes in who is worth $200 million, $300 million, and throws $30, $40 million into a race--we have had that in California. What happens to the people who cannot afford to put their own money in a race? What happens to their speech? 
So, it seems to me what the Court has done in Buckley is to support the speech of the wealthy candidates, not the speech of those of us who cannot afford to put those millions of dollars into place.

Mrs. BOXER. If money is speech, as the Supreme Court says, then more money must be more persuasive speech, and those ideas with the most money behind them will tend to prevail. 
This is un-American. I am a product of public schools. I go toe to toe here with people who went to Harvard and Yale and all those expensive schools. My schooling was free, from kindergarten all the way through college. It is the American way, to give us all that level playing field. We do not have a level playing field if we have to live with Buckley versus Valeo. It is an un-American decision. It is wrong. It is elitist. Ideas should prevail because of their inherent worth, not because they were able to be hyped in 30-second commercials. 
By the way, sometimes these commercials are not even ideas, they are terrible attacks on other candidates. 
So they are not even ideas, but somehow they are worth so much because an individual may have the money. 
`Money is speech' subverts the notion that ideas, not commercials, are the heart of the expression that the first amendment protects. 
My colleague, Senator Hollings, who has been so eloquent and so persuasive in this debate was right when he said--and I quote--`Our democracy must be saved from this excess.' 
Mr. President, it is time to go back to the original meaning of the first amendment, overturn Buckley versus Valeo and allow Congress to set spending limits that are fair for all congressional races. I can think of no more important issue than this one to be dealing with at this time as the furor swirls around all these large campaign contributions. Well, folks, those are the rules. Those are the rules. We allow it in the current system. We need to change the current system. To do that we need to pass the Hollings resolution. 
I thank you very much and I yield the floor. 
Mr. HOLLINGS addressed the Chair.

Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, before the Senator from Connecticut leaves the floor, I just wanted to thank him, because we are really running into some statutory deadlines here, and, as he pointed out, because we do sit on the Budget Committee together, these are not just written down for fun. 
They are serious. 
By April 1, the Budget Committee is statutorily required to vote out a budget. On April 15, the Congress is statutorily required to vote out a budget. We, on this side of the aisle, do not control the agenda around here. That is one very strong power of the majority. And believe me, we are sad that we do not have the ability to move an agenda, because if we did, we would have this budget on the floor today. We would be debating it. 
Why do I say that? It is because the budget of the United States of America is, in fact, the priorities of this Nation. What we spend on really says to us what we are about as a country. Do we invest in education? The President in his budget says yes. 
Do we make sure that our seniors are protected from deep, deep cuts in Medicare and Social Security? Yes, we care. The President cares. 
Does the President think we should do more to clean up the toxic waste sites and enforce environmental laws? Yes, he does. 
Does he think we ought to invest in NIH, the National Institutes of Health, so we can find cures for diseases, be it breast cancer or prostate cancer or Alzheimer's or scleroderma, all of these things which cry out for attention? The President says yes. 
The President says we should put more police on streets into community policing. That is all in his budget. 
A budget reflects the priorities of a nation. It tells the country who we are, what we think is most important, and, by the way, all in the context of a balanced budget, so certified by the Congressional Budget Office. So the President has put forward his effort. It is certified by the Congressional Budget Office to balance in 5 years. We have it in writing. We have the letter. 
Now we are saying to our Republican friends who control this--they have 55 Senators, we have 45; they are in charge--that it is their responsibility now to bring to the Budget Committee their budget. They do not like the President's budget. They have criticized the President's budget. They have done it day after day. Where is their budget? They are playing hide and seek with their budget, and I think it is time for show and tell. Show us your budget. Where are your priorities? 
We only know one thing from Republicans. We know that they want to institute a huge tax cut. The President has a tax cut proposal, and it is modest. It is $98 billion over 5 years. That is what it costs, and it is paid for. What does he do? He calls for tax relief to help middle-income Americans. He calls for a $500 tax credit for dependent children, a $10,000 deduction for post-secondary education, and a proposal to allow married taxpayers to exclude from capital gains taxes up to $500,000 in gains from selling a home. Single taxpayers could exclude up to $250,000. This would exempt about 99 percent of home sales from capital gains taxes. These are the President's tax proposals. 
The Republicans have said they want to do $200 billion of tax-cut proposals. So we are saying, `How are you going to pay for it? Where are your priorities?' 
There are two ways to do it in the Budget Committee. One way is for the Republicans to offer their own budget. They have talked for weeks about a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution. Where is their balanced budget? They want an amendment to the Constitution, but where is their actual budget? They don't have it. We don't know what it is. We only know they want to cut taxes over 5 years by $200 billion, over 10 years by $500 billion. Are they going to go back to the big cuts in Medicare, big cuts in education that we fought off last year? Remember? The Government shut down over these very proposals because President Clinton and the Democrats in Congress said, `Absolutely not, we're not going to do that to benefit the very wealthy.' 
A recent study shows that the top 1 percent of taxpayers would get an average tax break of more than $21,000, and that is extraordinary--the top 1 percent.

Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, the President has submitted a balanced budget. In that balanced budget, he protects Medicare and he protects Social Security. He moves forward with an investment and commitment in education and the environment and health research and transportation and putting more community police on the streets. This is a good budget, and if the Republicans don't like it--and I don't expect them to like it, that is why there is a difference in the parties here, we know we have different priorities--let them come forward with a budget instead of playing hide and seek. 
We only know one thing they want, and that is tax breaks to the very wealthy. They have put that out there. The President calls for $98 billion of tax cuts over a 5-year period. Those are targeted to the middle class so that when you sell your home, you will not have to pay capital gains taxes; so if you send your child to college, you can write off $10,000; so if you have children, you can exercise tax credits. These are modest tax breaks for the middle class. 
The Republicans, on the other hand, have a tax break that is so huge that it is going to cost $200 billion. A recent study shows the top 1 percent of taxpayers would get an average tax break of more than $21,000 while 99 percent of the rest of us do not get that benefit. So it seems to me we are going back to the battle that we had last year when the Government shut down. 
But this is even worse. They will not show us their budget. Where is it? We know the tax cut part. Where is the spending part? Where are we going to get the money to balance in the year 2002 to pay for those tax cuts? Are you going to do what you did the last time, take $200 billion out of Medicare? I hope not. That brought the Government to a shutdown. 
So I just am very confused. I can understand why my Republican colleagues would not like the President's budget. I can understand that. Frankly, I think the budget the President put forward is an excellent product, and it makes the investments we need to make while protecting our priorities. It has tax breaks for the middle class. It balances by 2002. I think it is a budget that the American people will get behind. But I know that my Republican colleagues criticize everything this President does, and they are going to find some things in that budget they do not like. It is fair. It is absolutely fair for them. 
But I will tell you what is unfair. It is unfair for them to point the finger at this President, by the way, and tell him to go back and redo it. That is what they are telling him to do. `Go back and do a second budget,' they say, when they have not even put a first budget forward. Let us see their first budget. Let us see their first budget. Maybe if they do a first budget, they will have some authority to say they want a second budget from the President. 
But the President has put his best case forward, certified by the CBO to balance, that protects Medicare, protects Medicaid, invests in our children, invests in the environment, invests in health research, puts more cops on the beat. And it is being ridiculed and criticized, and they say, go back and do it all again. Look, it is irresponsible at this point that we do not have a markup of a budget. 
If they do not want to produce a budget, I have another scenario. Let them take the President's budget, which they do not like, and amend it. 
If they want to make the tax cuts bigger, make the tax cuts bigger. Offer an amendment to make the tax cuts bigger, and show us how you are going to pay for it. 
You want to cut education? Have the guts to do it. Write an amendment. Tell the American people you do not think it is a priority. 
You want to cut out Environmental Protection Agency enforcement? Have the guts to offer an amendment. 
You want to spend less on health research, transportation? That is fine. That is your right. But what I do not think is your right is to criticize and point fingers at the President, tell him he has to go back and write a new budget before you even put your budget out there, all but your tax cuts--all but your tax cuts. 
Well, that is the easy part, folks. I love to talk about the tax cuts in the President's budget because I have to think they are very helpful to our society. But at the same time we have to make some tough choices in the budget, some tough choices all the way across the board. And that is what the President has done. 
So we have 7 working days to meet the April 1 deadline for the Budget Committee. We have only 14 working days before the deadline for final congressional passage. And the Republicans have no budget, or if they have a budget, it is in somebody's pocket or it is in some back room. It has not been brought out yet. I just think we are asking for trouble. We are going to miss these deadlines and are not going to do our work. 
As I said when I listened to the debate on the balanced budget amendment, I believed that people on both sides of that issue wanted to balance the budget. They had disagreements over whether you need to put it in the Constitution, but I surely believed once we disposed of that issue, we voted on it, we would get to the hard business of balancing the budget. But it is awfully difficult to do it when the only one who has put out a balanced budget is President Clinton, and the other side is poking holes at it, pointing fingers at it, telling him to go back and do it again. They have yet to come out with a budget. This is not a level playing field around here. It just does not make sense. It is not fair. And I think the American people will understand. 
There is a lot of time around here to dedicate yourself to lots of other issues--finger pointing and all the rest on campaign contributions and all of that. And I say, campaign finance reform is very important. We ought to bring that to the floor, too. That would probably be a real step forward for the American people. Bring forward the budget debate, bring forward the debate on campaign finance reform, two issues that are important to the country. But I do not see either of these 
headed for the Senate floor. I think that is most unfortunate. 
There is lots of time for other things, but not the things that I believe are very pressing matters. Certainly the most pressing is the budget, because the budget is what our priorities are about. 
When you sit down with the family and go over the monthly expenditures, you make some very important decisions, don't you? If we buy a new car, how much do we need to set aside for that car payment? Gee, maybe we should put that off a year and do something else. Maybe it is time that the family took a family vacation. So you decide to put off the new car, take the family vacation. We make these decisions in our families. 
The American family needs to make its decisions, and it is called a budget. It is where we make the very important decisions. How much do we need to defend this country against all enemies foreign and domestic? How much do we need to get our children ready for that work force? 
Today, we had a wonderful east-west initiative, a very bipartisan initiative. It included Senator Hatch, Senator Faircloth, Senator Kennedy, Senator Murray and myself; Massachusetts, California, Utah, Washington State, and North Carolina. This was a great bipartisan initiative. It is about job creation, and it is about our working together to make sure that in this country we make the investments we need in new technologies, we make the investments we need in education, we make the investments we need at the FDA so new drug approvals move swiftly. These are the issues that Republicans and Democrats alike came together around today. 
I will tell you, if we do not get moving on a budget, Mr. President, if we do not come together as Republicans and Democrats and work together, we are just going to come to a dead stop because out in the real world they meet deadlines--they meet deadlines. 
If you have a new product and you have to get it out to the marketplace, you better not have delays, because if you have delays in getting that product out to market, you can go bankrupt. 
Well, around here, statutory deadlines do not seem to mean much. Maybe I am wrong. Maybe my budget chairman right now is preparing to offer the Republican budget. He will lay it down next to the Democratic Clinton budget. We will look at the similarities. We will join hands. We will look at the differences. We will fight those out. We will look at the tax cuts. We will come together and move on. 
But I would say--and the reason several of us came over here today to talk about this--that time is moving, the clock is ticking. We have not seen the budget. We know what your tax cuts are. Where are your cuts? What are your priorities? 
I just hope that we can get back to why we were sent here. I mean, everybody said after this election it is time to put behind the rancor. But I think there is rancor when you point the finger at the President, in spite of the fact that the CBO said his budget balances, and tell him first, it does not balance, and second, do it again, when you have not even put your product on the table, except for your tax cuts, which benefit 1 percent, the top 1 percent of the people in this country instead of the middle class. 
We have a lot of work to do. I look forward to seeing the Republican budget, finding those areas of agreement, working on those areas of disagreement, getting this budget down to the floor by the statutory deadline and moving forward. 
Mr. President, I have the honor of not only serving on the Budget Committee but serving on the Appropriations Committee. This is, really, an extraordinary opportunity for the Senator from California to have both those assignments. I have an opportunity to debate the large priorities and then get it down to within those priorities--what is the most important investment to make, and in the context of a balanced budget, I might add. And I voted for several of those, one that Senator Conrad wrote, and one that former Senator Bill Bradley wrote. 
I am ready to make those tough choices. I like to believe my colleagues on the other side of the aisle are ready to make those tough choices. We should come together. The clock is ticking. So, we should do it, Mr. President. I hope we will back off this finger pointing at the White House. I hope we will look at this President's budget. I hope the Republicans will present their budget and we proceed to mark it up and proceed down the path of bipartisan cooperation so this country has a budget which is, in fact, our priorities. 
Thank you, Mr. President.

Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, as the majority leader knows, every Senator has a right to make such an objection, and two of our Senators decided to exercise their right. I think that has to be put into context that every Senator is sent here primarily to represent his or her constituency in his or her own State. 
I don't think the majority leader would suggest that Senators do not have the right to protect their constituency. I wanted to make that point because two Senators, who believe that this is not in the best interest of their State, had asked us to exercise their full and given rights as Senators to object to this meeting.

 Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today, Senator Bingaman and I are introducing the Border Infrastructure, Safety and Congestion Relief Act of 1997, legislation to authorize assistance for States along the U.S.-Mexico border which must cope with the increased demands on roads and other public infrastructure that result from expanded international trade. Our bill is also being introduced in the House of Representatives by my good friend, Representative Bob Filner. 
Last week, in a hearing before the Environment and Public Works Committee on ISTEA, Transportation Secretary Rodney Slater noted that since the passage of NAFTA, `we have seen a tremendous growth in trade. To make the most of these opportunities, we are proposing a new program to help improve our border crossings and major trade corridors--programs that will facilitate our domestic and international trade * * *.' 
Secretary Slater is right: NAFTA has greatly increased trade across our borders. If we all work together to fix our border crossings, increased trade offers great opportunities for the entire nation. If we do not, then NAFTA will act as an unfunded mandate that forces California and other border States to support other States' trade routes. 
The Administration is proposing a border crossing and trade corridors grant program to improve traffic efficiency at border crossings, to be funded at $45 million a year. All border States north and south would be eligible. 
As I told Secretary Slater at last week's hearing, I believe that the proposal, while a good step forward, is too limited for our border needs. Forty-five million across 14 States is simply not enough to address these crucial infrastructure problems. 
The Administration also wants to establish a new innovative financing program that would provide loans and credit assistance for large projects in the national interest--another good proposal, but one which, in my opinion, does not go far enough. 
The Boxer-Bingaman-Filner bill provides a two-stage system for Federal assistance to fund the States' top-priority border infrastructure projects: 
First, it authorizes appropriation of $125 million each year in 1998 through 2001--a total of $500 million--for a border infrastructure fund to provide Federal grants to border States and local governments in order to pay for new or upgraded connections to the regional and national road network. The bill also allows up to 
$10 million to be transferred from the fund to Federal law enforcement agencies to use for their own infrastructure improvements, such as border patrol roads and lighting. 
Second, our bill would authorize appropriations of $100 million to provide a Federal guarantee for loans made by border State infrastructure banks [SIBS] or border authorities for high cost projects such as toll roads that bring in revenue to the States. Federal guarantees will support up to $1 billion in State loans. 
For California, this could mean up to $50 million in Federal guarantees, leveraging up to $500 million in loans. California is one of 10 States designated last year by the Secretary of Transportation to participate in this innovative new method of financing transportation projects. 
Third, the bill authorizes Federal loan guarantees for border railroads, which could modernize and complete the San Diego and Arizona Eastern railway. This section would provide $10 million a year for 4 years for a total of $40 million in Federal funds to help railroads obtain low-interest private loans they might otherwise not get. 
Finally, our bill requires the Secretary of Transportation to submit an annual report to Congress on the volume of commercial traffic that is crossing the United States-Mexico border, and the level of international commercial vehicle safety violations. This report will help us gauge the effectiveness of the Federal response to trade demands on infrastructure in the border region. 
Mr. President, since the entire Nation benefits from international trade, I believe the Federal Government has a responsibility to help pay for the improvements in roads and other infrastructure that make that trade possible. Our bill will ensure that we begin to meet that Federal responsibility.

Mrs. BOXER. Thank you, Mr. President. I yield myself 10 minutes. 
Mr. President, as a member of the Budget Committee and now of the Appropriations Committee, I am keenly aware of the benefits of a balanced Federal budget. I have voted for three balanced budget plans--the Conrad plan, the Bradley plan, and the bipartisan Chafee-Breaux plan. As a Member of the House, I voted for a balanced budget statute. 
While I have very serious reservations about a balanced budget amendment, which I spoke about on this floor--as do, by the way, 1,100 economists, including Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan--I believe if we are to have a balanced budget amendment, however, which we cannot predict today if we will or not, it should be flexible enough to respond to emergencies which occur as a result of natural disasters. 
Now, Mr. President, I hope that Members of this U.S. Senate will understand that it is not one State of the Union that gets all of the natural disasters, although sometimes I feel, certainly, that my State gets far more than its fair share. I can tell you, if you look at this natural disaster risk profile that was put out by the U.S. Geological Service, you can see that there are tremendous risks for natural disasters all over this country. The light blue is the low risk, the darker greenish blue is the high risk, and this is the medium risk. Almost all over the country we have serious risks. This hatched area shows the extreme risk of tornado in the midsection of our Nation, and hurricanes, the extreme risk of hurricanes, as my friends in the Gulf States know so well, which are also on the Atlantic. 
Clearly, in California we run the risk of earthquakes. That is our biggest risk. But we have many other risks, as well: such as volcanos and floods. Floods occur all over the country. 
I say to my friends in the Senate that I pray that none of us ever has to come to the floor of the Senate asking for help in times of emergency. I will say under this amendment if you do that and you have hundreds of millions of dollars or billions of dollars of damages--as we have seen in Florida, as we have seen in California, as we have seen in the Midwest, as we have seen in many other parts of the country, in order to get this aid under this particular balanced budget amendment, you need to get 60 votes in this U.S. Senate. I will tell you right now there is no certainty of that. 
So what we do in our amendment, Mr. President, is simply say that when there is a declaration of a natural disaster, and that declaration is supported by a simple majority vote in both Houses of Congress, we will be able to move by a simple majority vote, not a 60-vote majority, and send the aid that is needed. 
Mr. President, I want to remind you by way of some photographs of some of these disasters that we have seen in my State. Here is a picture of the damage to a freeway in Northridge in 1994 where basically the freeway completely collapsed, people were killed, and we had to act very, very fast. In that particular earthquake, Mr. President, due to the kindness, the kindness of the Clinton administration and this Congress, we were able to pump into the Los Angeles area in excess of $11 billion to repair lives, to repair homes, to make sure that people had shelter--children, families. 
And I will tell you, Mr. President, if we had to find that $11 billion elsewhere in the budget or we needed to come up with 60 votes, I think it would be a very difficult thing to do. A supermajority is wrong in any case. It is wrong to give so much power to a minority when a natural disaster is a question of life or death. 
Here is another photograph, Mr. President. This is from this year. These are homes, and you can barely tell that because they are buried in water. That is the kind of flooding we had when levees broke--very similar to the Midwest. We need to move quickly when these disasters hit. 
Here is a photograph of Yosemite this year, Mr. President. You can't even pass through the road here. The communities that rely on tourism are in deep trouble. 
If Senators had to go to the floor and cut other parts of the budget to meet the needs of these emergencies, I will tell you, it would be very difficult. So I am very hopeful that we will not put this U.S. Senate into a straitjacket. This Senate already defeated some very important amendments to protect Social Security. They defeated, with a block of votes, amendments that would have allowed us to react in a serious recession or depression. Those 1,100 economists said that what the Senate is doing is dangerous. It is dangerous to put this Government into an economic straitjacket. And Alan Greenspan, whom so many of my friends on the other side of the aisle credit with this economic recovery--they turn away from his advice. 
But I say to them, here we are talking about life or death. Here we are talking about shelter for people who get hurt in a disaster. Here we are talking about a serious problem where we must act and we must act swiftly. And if we have to do it with 60 votes, or if we must cut corresponding amounts from the rest of the budget, I am saying this as sure as I am standing here--and I am proud to be standing here--we may leave Americans in dire straits because we are handcuffing our ability to react. 
There are some people here who obviously have no trust in their colleagues. They are calling for a supermajority. They don't trust their colleagues. They want a minority to be able to hold back a very important vote, perhaps to save people in my State, or people even in their own States. I think this is wrong. I said, when I came on to this floor several days ago at the beginning of this debate, I believe this is a very radical proposal. 
I believe the evidence is in and that those people who are following this debate now understand that we don't need this amendment to balance the budget. All we need to do to balance the budget is cast the tough votes. What is extraordinary to me is that most of the people voting for this balanced budget amendment weren't there when the tough votes were taken and when we were able to reduce this deficit--4 years in a row--from $290 billion down to $107 billion. Where were those people? So they offer up this fiscal figleaf, and it will put us in a straitjacket. It will tie our hands. We won't be able to protect Social Security or protect jobs in a depression or a severe recession. And now, without my amendment--and I am not that hopeful that we will win this because we have not won any of these amendments--a minority of the Senate, or a minority of the other body, could hold up desperately needed disaster aid. 
I will reserve the remainder of my time to respond to my good friend from Utah, and I am hopeful that Members will look at this and support the Boxer amendment, which is also supported by Senator Durbin and Senator Murray. 
Again, I reserve my time.

Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I want to respond to my friend's comments. And I hope he can stay on the floor because I think he raised some important points, some of which I agree with. 
He said this isn't a partisan issue. I agree with my friend from Utah. Alan Greenspan, who is the hero of many on the Republican side of the aisle--indeed, when we say the President's policies have brought us millions of new jobs and the lowest misery index, they always say it is Alan Greenspan. Alan Greenspan, Republican, opposes this amendment to the Constitution. 
I will give you another voice, Jean M. Ross of the nonpartisan California Budget Project, wrote that a balanced budget amendment would limit the Federal Government's ability to help States needing economic assistance. I can say to my friend that economic assistance to States is not only needed during the recessions, which my friend thought was a big loophole, but it is certainly needed in times of disaster. 
If you look at this map, you can see almost the entire country is under some risk for disaster. 
My friend says we can never balance the budget. He has all these budgets up there. I was glad to see Senator Byrd point out that the biggest deficits occurred in the 1980's in those books because of trickle-down economics, and a huge military buildup. We didn't pay for it. Those are what those books say. 
My friend says we are never going to have a balanced budget until we have a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution. We will never have a balanced budget until we vote for a balanced budget, and I have done that three times. I voted the tough votes, and the deficit is going down. I feel standing up here is quite fiscally responsible because of those votes. But when you put this country in an economic straitjacket, I think it is dangerous. 
My friend says he doesn't understand my amendment. I find that extraordinary because I offered it the last time we voted on this balanced budget. No one had problems understanding it. It is the same amendment. But let me read to my friend the purpose as written in my amendment, in case he doesn't understand it. The purpose is to provide Federal assistance to supplement State and local efforts to alleviate the damage, loss, hardship, and suffering caused by disasters or emergencies by exempting spending that is designated emergency requirements by both the President and the Congress. 
The point is that it is very clear that the President will declare a disaster or emergency. The Congress will then take a look at it. The Congress will then act. And, if the Congress agrees that this is a disaster or an emergency, then the 60-vote requirement is waived. 
My friend says it is easy to get 60 votes in an emergency. I would like to tell my friend a story. We had an earthquake in San Francisco and a freeway collapsed. It was called the Cypress Freeway. It is in Oakland, and it was destroyed. I am very familiar with this because my husband crossed that freeway an hour before it went down. So I am very familiar with the Cypress Freeway. We are rebuilding the Cypress Freeway. 
And one of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle--as a matter of fact, it was the then majority leader, Bob Dole, who decided that he didn't like the rebuilding plan and brought the issue before us. And I had to fight for my life, along with Senator Feinstein, to keep the rebuilding of the Cypress Freeway on the floor and alive and fulfill our obligations to the people of Northern California. We forced a vote on it. We got 53 votes, and we were able to move forward. We did not get 60 votes. Had this balanced budget requirement been in place we would not have been able to finish building the Cypress Freeway. 
So for anyone who comes on this floor and thinks that it is easy to get 60 votes when politics plays a role in some of it, and budget deficits will play a role in it, I would just say to them, please don't give that kind of power to a minority of the U.S. Senate. Let us vote a simple majority vote in case of natural disasters. 
There is no confusion about this amendment. If my friend has confusion, all he has to do is read the purpose. It is clear what we are talking about. 
I will just show one more picture again of what we are talking about. We are talking about flooding and storms that cause roads to shut down. We are talking about houses being buried in the water because of floods. It is real simple, I say to my friend. Let's not tell people it is confusing. It is pretty clear. 
I yield the floor. I thank the Chair.

Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I just heard my colleague talk about information that he feels would lead people to change their view on the tragic issue of late-term abortion. I want to make a clear point that I made today to the press when they asked me about this. I think it is deplorable that anyone on any side of this issue would knowingly misstate the truth, on any side. There is no excuse for that. We can't resolve problems in this Nation if people don't tell the truth. 
The issue here is--and I think it is very important to state it--that under Roe versus Wade, which is the law of the land and has been upheld by the Supreme Court several times, a woman has a right to choose, without Government interference, in the early stages of her pregnancy. Now, that is a matter of debate. Some colleagues here think that is a very bad decision by the Court. Some colleagues here would like to outlaw abortion at any stage. But what Roe versus Wade said is postviability. Once the fetus is viable, the Government can come in and regulate abortion. I agree with that. 
What Roe versus Wade says is that the Government can regulate abortion at the postviability stage very clearly, as long as the life of the woman is protected and her health is protected. 
Now, Mr. President, I think we owe it to the women of this Nation to ensure that they do not die, and if they have a very complicated pregnancy, where if they were to carry the child to term, they would lose their life or endure severe adverse health consequences where perhaps they could be paralyzed for life or become infertile--we had women, several of whom were religious Catholics and consider themselves pro-life, that had to go through and endure this procedure because they were told either their life was at stake or they could never carry another child. 
So the issue isn't about how many times this procedure is used. My view is that even if it is used once incorrectly, it is wrong. I think what we ought to do is say that we should never allow an abortion in the late term, postviability, unless it is necessary to protect the life of the woman or her health. And I think that what we ought to start doing in this U.S. Senate is to start to come together on a couple of things. I don't think we are ever going to agree on the basis of Roe versus Wade. I think my friend from Indiana believes that abortion is wrong, and he is willing to outlaw it. I support Roe versus Wade. We have a fair disagreement. So we can't come together on that. 
I think we can come together on two issues surrounding this difficult issue. First, family planning. We ought to all support family planning, so that every child is a wanted child and so that the number of abortions would drop dramatically. I was so pleased to see colleagues on the Republican side of the aisle join with colleagues on the Democratic side of the aisle and make a profamily planning statement. We ought to come together on that, and we ought to come together on the issue of late-term abortion. We ought to say it should not be allowed, unless it is necessary to save the life of a mother or spare her irreparable harm. 
I really think we have an opportunity now, because this issue has been brought up again, to walk down the aisle together on those two points--family planning and on the late-term abortion issue. Consistent with Roe versus Wade, we can do that. 
So, Mr. President, I know we will be revisiting this issue. I will, once again, bring to the floor the stories of the women who had to have these procedures, postviability, because their life was in danger or they might have been infertile. I will continue to put the woman's face on the issue. I hope we can reach agreement, in a bipartisan way, on this matter and move forward so that, in essence, we can reduce the number of abortions in this country and that every child can be a healthy and a wanted child. Thank you very much, Mr. President. 
I yield the floor. 
Mr. DASCHLE addressed the Chair.

 Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Women's Cardiovascular Diseases Research and Prevention Act, a bill to expand and intensify research and educational outreach programs regarding cardiovascular diseases in women. This bill will aid our Nation's doctors and scientists in developing a coordinated and comprehensive strategy for fighting this terrible disease. 
Cardiovascular disease is the No. 1 killer of women in the United States. Over 479,000 women die from cardiovascular disease each year and 1 in 5 women has some form of the disease. Research is our best hope for averting this national tragedy which strikes so many of our grandmothers, mothers, aunts, and daughters. 
The Women's Cardiovascular Diseases Research and Prevention Act authorizes $140 million to the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute to expand and intensify research, prevention, and educational outreach programs for heart attack, stroke, and other cardiovascular diseases in women. 
This bill will educate women and doctors about the dire threat heart disease poses to women's health. It will help train doctors to better recognize symptoms of cardiovascular disease which are unique to women. It would also teach women about risk factors, such as smoking, obesity, and physical inactivity, which greatly increase their chances of developing coronary heart disease. 
For years, women have been under-represented in studies conducted on heart disease and stroke. Models and tests for detection have been conducted largely on men. This legislation will help ensure that women are well represented in future heart and stroke research studies. 
The Women's Cardiovascular Diseases Research and Prevention Act is being introduced in the House today by Representative Maxine Waters. 
I urge my colleagues to commit to combating cardiovascular disease by supporting this bill.

 Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, this week, President Clinton must make an important decision regarding our Nation's fight against illegal drug trafficking. He must decide by March 1 whether to certify that Mexico and Colombia have, in the past year, taken all appropriate and necessary actions in the fight against international narcotics trafficking. 
Under the international antidrug law, in order for a country which is either a major source of narcotics or a major drug transit country to continue to receive U.S. aid, the President must certify as adequate the performance of that country in cooperating with the United States or taking its own actions in the drug fight. 
The law gives the President three choices. First, he can certify that the country is either fully cooperating with the United States or has taken adequate steps on its own to combat the narcotics trade. Second, he can decertify the country, concluding that the country has failed to meet the requirements of cooperation or action. Third, he can provide a vital national interest waiver--essentially a finding that the country has not met the standards of the law, but that our own national interest is best protected by continuing to provide assistance to the country. 
With respect to Colombia, I believe the only appropriate course for the President to follow is to decertify Colombia, just as he did last year. There is too much credible evidence that Colombian President Samper has taken millions in campaign contributions from the Cali Cartel and that he has failed to take the antidrug and anticorruption actions that he pledged to us in 1994. 
The question of Mexico is more complicated. Mexico is the leading transit country for cocaine coming into the United States: 50 to 70 percent of all cocaine shipped into the United States comes through Mexico. It is also a significant source of heroin, methamphetamines, and marijuana. 
President Zedillo seems to be strongly committed to rid the Mexican law enforcement system of corruption and to fight the Mexican drug cartels. However, the reports and events of the past few weeks have made it clear that corruption in police ranks--even up to the very top ranks--is still rampant in Mexico. 
Just last week, it was revealed that the man hired only 3 months ago to be Mexico's drug czar--the head of their antinarcotics agency--was fired abruptly after being accused of taking bribes from one of Mexico's most powerful drug lords. It would be as if our own drug czar, Gen. Barry McCaffrey, were found to be in league with drug gangs in our country. 
Why didn't the Mexican Government tell us weeks ago that their man was under investigation? Why did they let our own drug agency brief him and give him important intelligence about our antidrug efforts? That is not cooperation by any standard. 
Mexico has also failed in the past year to take its own steps to meet the standards of the certification law. It has not acted boldly to root out corruption in its law enforcement establishment; it has acted to extradite to the United States only a few Mexican nationals suspected of involvement in United States drug activities; it has failed to implement new anticrime laws enacted last year. 
Given these facts, I do not believe Mexico should be certified in compliance with the drug law. However, I believe the President would be justified in granting a vital national interest waiver of the requirements of the law. That would send a message to Mexico that its actions in the past year were inadequate; but it would allow the United States to continue joint efforts with President Zedillo and others in his administration who are committed to the drug fight.

Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise in support of House Joint Resolution 36. 
This is a vote solely to determine whether funds already appropriated for fiscal year 1997 will be released 5 months late or 9 months late. 
Currently at least one woman dies every minute from causes related to pregnancy and childbirth. In developing countries, maternal mortality is the leading cause of death for women in reproductive age. The World Bank estimates a 20-percent reduction in maternal death would result from improved access to family planning. 
In parts of sub-Saharan Africa, there are more than 1,500 maternal deaths for every 100,000 live births; in the United States, this ratio is 12 deaths per 100,000 live births. By being able to plan their pregnancies, mothers are able to ensure they bear their children at their healthiest times and that pregnancies do not occur too close together. This reduces the risks to the lives of both the mother and her children. 
Babies born less than 2 years after their next oldest sibling are twice as likely to die in the first year as those born after an interval of at least 2 years. Analysis of data from 25 developing countries shows that, on average, infant mortality would be reduced by one-quarter if all births were spaced at least 2 years apart. 
Family planning education also helps prevent the spread of sexually transmitted diseases, including AIDS. 
At least 76,000 women die every year from the consequences of unsafe abortions. Thousands more suffer serious complications that can result in chronic pain and infertility. A U.S. study found that for every $1 increase in public funds for family planning, there is a decrease of 1 abortion per 1,000 women. 
According to the Rockefeller Foundation, in just 1 year, cuts and severe restrictions of Federal funding for family planning programs will result in an additional 4 million unplanned pregnancies and 1.6 million of those will end in abortion; 8,000 of those women will die in pregnancy and childbirth. These are conservative estimates. 
Pathfinder International is one organization whose 30-year partnership with USAID has delivered high-quality family planning, reproductive health services, and information to some of the poorest countries in the world. The delays in Federal funding have jeopardized a significant portion of Pathfinder's programs. 
One woman who has benefited from Pathfinder's programs is a 27-year-old Bangladeshi woman named Ferdousi Begum. She was married when she was 14 years old. Ferdousi and 
her husband, Mahmud, are poor and their lives are hard. Mahmud works 12 to 14 hours a day and Ferdousi works as a part-time domestic in addition to tending the home and being a mother. But they are happy--family planning has given them hope for a better future. 
Ferdousi and Mahmud received counseling to postpone having children until she was 18 and her body was more developed. After having two daughters spaced several years apart, they decided not to have any more children. 
Mahmud speaks proudly of his daughters. He speaks of having dreams of his older daughter, Salma, becoming a doctor after winning a prize in a science competition. 
However, after years of using family planning in order to provide a better life for her family, Ferdousi is at risk of becoming pregnant again. Without the necessary funding, many local affiliates are unable to restock their contraceptive supplies. An additional 4 month delay will have severe repercussions on Ferdousi, her family, and millions of other families like theirs in Bangladesh and around the world. 
In 1960 in Chile, less than 3 percent of married women were practicing family planning and the abortion rate was 77 abortions per 1,000 married women of reproductive age. By 1990, use of family planning had increased to 56 percent of married women, and the abortion rate had dropped to 45 per 1,000. 
Data from Bogota, Columbia showed a one-third increase in contraceptive use between 1976 and 1986, accompanied by a 45-percent decrease in the abortion rate during the same period. 
In Mexico City use of contraception increased by about 24 percent between 1987 and 1992, while the abortion rate fell 39 percent. 
In Almaty, Kazakstan, the United States population program has provided funding to train doctors and nurses and to increase contraceptive supplies for 28 clinics. Between 1993 and 1994, the number of people provided contraceptives by the clinics increased by 59 percent, while the number of abortions fell by 41 percent. 
In Russia, contraceptive use has increased from 19 percent to 24 after an affiliate of the International Planned Parenthood Federation opened in 1991. During that period, the abortion rate dropped from 109 per 1,000 in 1990 to 76 in 1994. The total number of abortions fell from 3.6 million in 1990 to 2.8 million in 1994. For years, the average Russian woman had 7 to 8 abortions. 
In Hungary, a dramatic drop in abortion rates from a peak of 80 per 1,000 women in the late 1960's to just over 30 per 1,000 women in 1986 is due in part to an increase in contraceptive use. 
The numbers are incredible, but what is truly important and who we can't forget are the women and their families represented in these numbers. 
One such woman is 30-year-old Maria Elena Absalon Ramirez in Mexico. Her husband earns just $80 per month to support Maria and their 4 children. They cannot afford contraceptives and rely on USAID. These are Maria's words: `What I fear most is becoming pregnant again. One more child would completely change our life; it would be our ruin.' 
Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support the resolution and release the international family planning funds.

 Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Devil's Slide Tunnel Act to allow previously appropriated funds to be used for a tunnel project in San Mateo County, CA. This bill is essentially a technical change to a 1984 emergency spending bill to provide relief for heavy winter storms that occurred during the winter of 1982-83. These rains caused a mountain mud slide to block the use of California Highway 1, a key coastal highway linking San Mateo County to San Francisco. 
This section of highway has become known as Devil's Slide because it crosses a sea cliff 600 feet above the Pacific Ocean surf about 12 miles south of San Francisco. Perennial closures because of mud slides have cut off coastal communities, particularly access to emergency services during disasters as well as to local businesses. Congress approved the supplemental appropriations for permanent repair after exhaustive study, including field hearings by the House Surface Transportation Subcommittee. 
The California Department of Transportation [Caltrans] made temporary repairs and proposed a bypass construction. The bypass was opposed by environmental interests and construction was blocked in court for years. This battle fortunately ended in November when voters overwhelming approved a referendum calling for construction of a mile-long tunnel as a project alternative. 
Congressman Tom Lantos has introduced legislation in the House to carry out the voters' request. I am introducing an identical bill. Our legislation simply amends the law to allow for previously appropriated funds to be used for a project alternative and that the amount is available until expended. 
It is time that we fix this dangerous highway section that threatens many people's lives and livelihoods. I urge my colleagues to join me and take swift action to allow the project alternative to proceed.

 Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I wish to call to the attention of the Senate a terrible tragedy that occurred yesterday in Bridgeport, CT. The death of 8-year-old Tynisha Gathers demonstrates once again the need for child safety locks on American-made handguns. 
Yesterday, Tynisha was playing at her grandmother's house when one of her friends found a small 38-caliber handgun. In the course of acting out a scene from a popular movie, Tynisha was shot in the forehead and killed. Her 10-year-old playmate has been charged with manslaughter. If the handgun used to kill Tynisha Gathers included adequate safety features, this tragedy could have been prevented. 
I have introduced legislation to require all American-made handguns to meet the same quality and safety standards currently required of imports. President Clinton has recognized this crisis, calling in his State of the Union Address for Congress to pass legislation requiring `child safety locks on handguns to prevent unauthorized use.' 
Mr. President, I urge all Senators to read this Associated Press story about the tragic death of Tynisha Gathers and consider cosponsoring S. 70. 
I ask that the Associated Press article be printed at this point in the Record.

 Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise today to celebrate the life of Dr. Carlton Goodlett. Dr. Goodlett recently passed from this life, leaving it richer and more decent for his presence. The challenge of his voice, conscience, and healing hand is the legacy of a singular man. 
To say that Carlton Goodlett was multitalented is to understate his genuinely remarkable energy and versatility. He was a medical doctor, held a doctorate in psychology and published a newspaper for nearly 50 years. He was local president of the NAACP and worked side by side with many of the giants of the civil rights era. Born in a time and place where discrimination and violence were commonplace, he remained passionately concerned about peace and equality throughout his entire life. 
Although his contributions reasonate most clearly in San Francisco's African-American neighborhoods, Dr. Goodlett's example and spirit were in inspiration to many young Americans, irrespective of race. When he acted or spoke, his message was meant for anyone with an open heart and mind. He embraced people with great warmth and ideas with great facility. He was a leader in the truest sense. 
At the Sun-Reporter, he nurtured numerous fledgling writers, giving them the opportunity to develop their professional talents while simultaneously providing readers with invaluable insight into a vibrant community at play, at work, in worship, and in struggle. As a physician, he helped guide young men and women into medicine. As a civil rights leader and advocate for peace, he appealed to conscience of leaders and citizens alike. 
Dr. Goodlett considered life and community to be sacred. Though his time has come and gone, his message of hope and fairness endures. For all he did for others, he will forever be treasured and missed.

Mrs. BOXER. Thank you very much, Mr. President. Before he leaves the floor, I would like to personally thank the newly elected Senator from Illinois, Senator Durbin, for his leadership on this extremely important amendment that he offered the Senate, which would have made this balanced budget amendment a much more attractive amendment to the people of Illinois, to the people of California, to the people of all of our States--to the Nation. 
A very interesting poll just came out in the February 9 edition of The Los Angeles Times, some people, when asked in the abstract, said they would support a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution, under any circumstances. However, about 39 percent of the people polled said they would not support the balanced budget amendment if it could mean cuts in areas that they overwhelmingly approve of, such as Medicare, Social Security, and Medicaid. 
I learned at a very early age from my parents what it was like to live through a depression. There was no safety net then in the 1930's, and people were literally committing suicide because there was no safety net. They didn't know what they were going to do for their families, and they were absolutely filled with despair. 
We have learned a lot since then, and Senator Sarbanes, with his charts, has shown us that we learned a lot since the Great Depression, and that we have the ability to soften those recessionary periods. Yet, in this inflexible amendment that is before us, it would take a supermajority, Mr. President, to act on behalf of the American people. Now, I did not come here to this great Senate to have my hands tied in the case of a recession, a depression, or a natural disaster. 
I want to thank my friend from Illinois for raising that issue as well. He has gone through the Midwest floods, as I have gone through the California floods, earthquakes, and fires, and there but for the grace of God goes every single one of us in this Chamber. And if we cannot act as a majority, without the requirement of a supermajority, to meet the needs of the people, 
then what are we doing here? 
By rejecting this amendment of the Senator from Illinois, which he was so eloquent in explaining, I truly believe that this amendment, as it stands, is dangerous. It is dangerous for our people.

Some of us have heard about these depressions from our parents. Look at the Senator's chart. We can clearly see what has happened since World War II. We have spared our people from the deepest, darkest days of recession and depression. 
By rejecting the amendment offered by the Senator from Illinois, which would have given this U.S. Senate and the House the ability to act without requiring a supermajority in times of recession, this becomes a very radical amendment to the Constitution. 
Does my friend not agree?

Mrs. BOXER. I want to thank the senior Senator from Maryland for his leadership on this. I have the honor and privilege of serving with him on the Banking Committee, where he is the ranking member, and on the Budget Committee, where we serve together. So we have a chance to debate and discuss these issues. A great privilege it is always to have the participation of my friend from Maryland because he brings such insight. 
I say to my colleague that he and I have voted for balanced budgets in the past. That is why this amendment debate is really a figleaf. As my friend pointed out, it does not do one thing to balance the budget. 
I am going to show some most extraordinary newspaper articles which have appeared as editorials or as op-eds. The writers of those articles call this balanced budget amendment what it is--a technique for people to say, `Oh, I voted to balance the budget,' even though in many cases these colleagues didn't vote for the one budget in 1993 that my friend from Maryland and I voted for along with a bare majority of the Senate which has set this country on a course of 4 years of declining deficits and has set this country on a course of economic prosperity. We have far to go, but we are moving in the right direction. The vote that mattered, I say to my friend, was the vote that we cast, the tough vote--and some people lost their seats because of it--that made the actual changes in budgetary policy which has cut this deficit from $290 billion when George Bush left office to where it is today at about $107 billion. That was the tough vote. 
This vote is an easy vote. We are just setting the stage for the States to call conventions in order to ratify the amendment. And even if it is approved by the States, in the end, there is a real possibility that there will be a disagreement and the courts 
will be called upon to try to resolve the situation. 
So it makes no sense. That is why 1,100 economists condemn the balanced budget amendment as unsound and unnecessary. I know that this statement has been quoted time and time again. 
I see that my friend is on the floor now with some very important numbers. I am happy to yield to him.

Mrs. BOXER. I thank my friend and colleague. 
I think the record is clear. We are making progress, and what we ought to be doing now is debating how we make further progress. Instead we are spending many, many hours discussing an amendment to the Constitution which does not one thing to continue this progress. 
These economists, including 11 Nobel laureates in economics from Stanford University, the University of California at Berkeley, New York University, Carnegie-Mellon, Yale, and MIT--you can't have a better group of people who know what they are talking about. Some of what they say is, `We condemn the proposed balanced budget amendment to the Federal Constitution. It is unsound and unnecessary.' 
I received a degree in economics many years ago, and I know that economists choose their words carefully because economics is not an exact science. As a result, economists try very carefully to measure their tone and measure their words. So when you have 1,100 economists signing on to this, and using the word condemn, this is serious business. Now, maybe there are colleagues in the Senate who could stand up to some of these people and tell them they are incorrect, but I have a hard time believing that. 
Let me sum up what they said. And it just parallels what the Senator from Maryland has shared with us. 
The amendment is not needed to balance the budget. The measured deficit has fallen dramatically in recent years from $290 billion in '92 to $107 billion-- 
They say: 
The deficit is 1.3 percent of gross domestic product, a smaller proportion than that of any other major nation. 
The Senator from Maryland has said this very same thing. They go on to say: 
Congress and the President can reduce the deficit to zero, balance the budget or even create budget surpluses without a constitutional amendment. 
These 1,100 economists close by saying: 
There is no need to put the Nation in an economic straitjacket. Let the President and Congress make fiscal policy in response to national needs and priorities as the authors of our Constitution wisely provided. 
Now, Mr. President, I am so honored to be in this Senate representing the largest State in the Union. It truly is an honor. I am humbled by it. I am humbled by our Constitution. And so I think we need to be pretty humble when we think of how we are going to vote on this. I think we have to be humble. I think we have to look at what the experts tell us. I think we have to look at the facts as they have been laid before us by my friend from Maryland. Our economy is moving in the right direction. 
Having a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution would in fact put us in a straitjacket, would in fact tie our hands, would in fact make it very difficult for us to get out of an economic crisis when we may have to temporarily go out of balance while we take care of it. 
Let me ask a question of my friend from Maryland, who is still in the Chamber. 
In his State he has been fortunate not to have had the number of natural disasters that I and the people of my State have had to face. He knows this place, however, because he has been here a long time, and the people of Maryland keep sending him back for a reason--because he is wise. So I ask my friend, under this amendment as it is proposed--and particularly since this Senator Durbin's recession amendment was defeated--California was in a horrible recession, the worst in the country. We moved from an economy that was heavily supported by jobs in the defense sector, to an economy without the great dependence it once had on defense sector jobs, and we had a very hard time. We made investments that softened the blow but still it was tough. Then we got hit with an unbelievable earthquake called the Northridge earthquake. Because the Federal Government acted swiftly, because we could act without having to have a supermajority, we were able to pump $11 billion into the California economy to rebuild the infrastructure. We are rebuilding the universities. We are rebuilding hospitals. We are rebuilding people's lives. 
I say to my friend, I will offer an amendment to waive the requirements of a supermajority in case of natural disasters such as earthquakes, fires, floods--where people are homeless and in trouble. 
Under the amendment as it stands now, however, if any State had a disaster like that which occurred in California, with $11 billion of damage and people hurt and suffering, does my friend believe we could get the required supermajority to act swiftly? 
I have very grave doubts about it, because I have seen us have a hard time even getting 51 votes. I ask my friend, would he want to be here representing a State that had a disastrous flood or earthquake or any other natural disaster and have this amendment in place which requires a supermajority?

Mrs. BOXER. I give my friend an example. The San Francisco earthquake, Loma Prieta, which was way back, we are still rebuilding from, I say to my friend. And we had a freeway go down, just a disaster, and we got the funds to rebuild the freeway. About 2 years ago on the floor of this Senate a Senator said we have to back off this because we are building it in a different fashion and it is costing too much money. 
I stood up as one of the two Senators from California and explained that if we rebuilt it the same way it was prior to the earthquake, it would fall down again. We had to put a little more into it to make sure that the structure was as safe as possible--to ensure that the residents traveling on the freeway would be safe. 
Well, I won that vote, but I have to tell you it was close, I say to my friend. 
Under this constitutional amendment, there is no way I could have done that because it would have required a supermajority--we would have needed to be out of balance for a short period of time because of the unanticipated funds required to respond to the disaster. 
And I say to my friend that, if any State experiences a multibillion dollar disaster, unless you can come on the floor and convince colleagues to cut other programs, you are going to be in deep trouble. That is the other reason why this is a very, very radical amendment. 
I want to say to my friend, I so appreciate his participating in this discussion. It means a lot to me that he is here. As a matter of fact, it reminds me of one time out in California when he was at a forum with me, when most people had gone home. It was a situation very similar to tonight. 
But I want to say to my friend, as we sit on the Budget Committee together, there is one figure who comes before the Budget Committee that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle just think is the best. They credit this person with everything good about the economy, and his name is Alan Greenspan. I think Alan Greenspan is doing a good job. I sometimes disagree with him, but overall I think he has done a good job. Where is Alan Greenspan on this constitutional amendment to balance the budget? Let me say--I am not going to read his whole statement, but I think this sums it up: 
As a consequence, what I am concerned about is that it is very difficult to implement technical economic policy through the Constitution. I don't like the idea of embodying concrete economic issues in the Constitution, which is going to have to stay in the Constitution for 50 or 100 years or more. 
So I find it really interesting that on every single economic issue, my colleagues on the other side of the aisle--who all support this amendment; I do not think there is one of my colleagues on the other side who is going to vote the other way--have abandoned Alan Greenspan's leadership, where they have followed him down every other economic road. Again, I ask my colleagues to be a little humble on this. We do not have all the answers. None of us has all the answers. But, certainly, if you are going to walk away from someone who you think has been right on target, keeping inflation under control, keeping the economic recovery going, and he is telling us not to do this, it seems to me fairly arrogant to disregard it. 
I would like to share with my colleagues what I think is a terrific editorial that appeared in the Los Angeles Times. As a matter of fact, it is so good I am going to read you most of it. I honestly think this says it the way it is. It speaks for me. 
Balanced Budget Plan: Looks, 10; workability, zero. 
This seductive idea won't stand up under close inspection. 
Here is what it says: 
No. 1 on the legislative menu of the new 105th Congress is a Republican-backed constitutional amendment to require a balanced budget by the year 2002 and every year thereafter. What could have more first-glance appeal? But amending the Constitution, despite the political symbolism, is not the way to go about controlling government spending. 
On Tuesday, President Clinton voiced his strongest opposition yet, appropriately characterizing the proposed amendment as a `straitjacket' that pays little regard to the vagaries of the economy. For instance, it would not provide the flexibility needed to deal with recessions . . . 
My friend and I from Maryland, we have gone through this, I think, in a detailed way. It says: 
. . . it would not provide the flexibility needed to deal with recessions, when Federal funding might have to rise as revenues drop. The proposal would allow suspension of the balanced budget requirement only if three-fifths of each House approved. That's not much of an escape valve, considering how long it takes Congress to act on most problems . . . 
We know that. It takes us time to gear up around here, as the President is going to learn as he enjoys his stay in the Senate. So, in time of recession, we are often behind the curve as it is. We come in the second quarter, after the recession. 
The amendment, pushed through the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday, generally fails to spell out how a balanced budget would be achieved. The difficult decisions on what spending to cut or how to raise revenues are not addressed but simply are left to future Congresses--and everyone knows how difficult and seemingly endless budget negotiations can be in the Capitol . . . 
The article closes by saying: 
The amendment--which will be put before the States' legislatures if it wins approval in the House and Senate--has drawn opposition from a broad spectrum of economists and fiscal experts. It should. The amendment is irresponsible governance, fiscally reckless and a false political star. 
The Los Angeles Times is not known for such strong language. It is very measured. The editorials are very measured. So let me repeat that: 
The amendment is irresponsible governance, fiscally reckless, and a false political star. 
The last article which I want to mention comes from the USA Today, on Monday, February 3, 1997. The headline reads: 
This is cheap political grandstanding. There is an easier way to balance the budget: Just do it. 
`Just do it.' It says, `Balance The Budget? Yes. But An Amendment? No.' 
So, whether it is our worry about being in a straitjacket when there is a recession or a natural disaster, or whether it is our worry about the Social Security trust fund--which absolutely will be hit if an amendment does not carry the day to exempt it--or whether it is our worry about Medicare--all of these areas are at great risk if we continue with this proposal, which has been condemned by 1,100 economists. Editorials all over the country have pointed out that passing a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution is just not a wise thing to do. 
We can and must balance the budget. I voted for six balanced budgets. I am very proud of that. I am proud to see the deficit coming down. It is a serious matter. I hope, however, my colleagues will have the courage to walk away from an idea that seems wonderful on its face, but if you look behind the door, you will see the pitfalls there. 
I thank you, Mr. President, for your kind courtesies. I thank my colleague from Maryland for participating in this discussion with me. I hope, as we go down the road on this debate, we will have some more colleagues step away from this at-first-glance politically popular idea and realize that it will put us in an economic straitjacket with no way to respond to recessions or other economic emergencies or crises. So it is putting us into a straitjacket which can only harm the people. 
To close: `Balance The Budget? Yes. But An Amendment? No.' 
There is an easier way to balance the budget: Just do it. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

 Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise today to honor Herb Caen, Pulitzer Prize-winning columnist for the San Francisco Chronicle. Herb began his career in 1938. He left us this past Sunday, taking with him an irreplaceable part of the community he so dearly loved and that so dearly treasured him. 
Although he is gone, he leaves a rich, woven history of a time, place, and people. His was the common thread in the life and lives of this often deliberately uncommon metropolis. He grew up in Sacramento, but made San Francisco home not only for himself but for his legions of readers--whether they lived in town or not. He captured the city's vivid colors and rhythms. 
People read Herb Caen to find out what was going on. We looked for names we recognized, places we might visit, and places we might avoid. For nearly six decades, Herb was our connection to a place so dynamic, it seemed only he could divine its pulse and variety. 
Every morning, Herb Caen started your day. Herb conjured humanity from a youthful heart and old typewriter daily--and we thank him. 
My office in San Francisco overlooks Herb Caen Way--a beautiful promenade along the waterfront. From the widows, one can see the people of San Francisco moving from place to place, carrying on with the business of living, and carrying memories of Herb with them. Although we may be deprived of his words, how appropriate that even now Herb continues to lead us about his adopted town with which he conducted a public love affair for almost 60 years. 
In awarding the Pulitzer Prize to Herb Caen, the Pulitzer Committee referred to his `continuing contribution as a voice and conscience of his city.' His voice is no longer with us, but his joy in celebrating San Francisco and its inhabitants will live on in generations of San Franciscans who read him and were touched by his life.

 Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Mr. Ezunial `E.Z.' Burts, a talented public servant from California, who is retiring this month as the executive director of the Port of Los Angeles after 12 years of outstanding leadership. 
E.Z. Burts has spent his entire career in public service. Early in his career, he worked for the Fresno County Economic Opportunities Commission where he administered the county's youth employment program. Later he became a top aide to Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley, where he handled a number of duties, including serving as the mayor's liaison to the police and fire departments. He also helped plan security for the highly successful 1984 Olympic Games in Los Angeles, before assuming the helm of the port later that same year. 
During Mr. Burts' tenure, the Port of Los Angeles has become one of the Nation's top trade centers, generating billions of dollars in revenue and creating thousands of jobs. During this period of amazing growth, the port's operating revenue has doubled and the total cargo volume has increased by more than one-third. In fact, the Los Angeles Customs District is the largest in the Nation, and the port has become a major gateway for our Nation's Pacific rim trade. Mr. President, to put into perspective Mr. Burts' responsibility over the years, the Port of Los Angeles accounts for more than 1 million jobs nationwide, including 1 out of every 27 jobs in southern California. 
Mr. Burts has also been at the forefront of the Alameda corridor project, an enterprise which is very important to my State, and indeed to the entire country. When the Alameda corridor is completed, goods will be quickly shipped from the Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach to rail yards in downtown Los Angeles, and from there to points throughout the country. E.Z. Burts has been a key supporter of the Alameda corridor since its inception. 
Mr. President, I am pleased to announce that Mr. Burts will continue to be a leader in the southern California community, as he prepares to become the new president of the Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce. I wish Mr. Burts and his family well as he takes on this new challenge.

Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise as an original cosponsor of this resolution concerning the need for accurate guidelines for mammography screening for women between the ages of 40 and 49. 
Since 1993, when the NCI rescinded its original guidelines I have been trying to get them to return to their original position. In the past 3 years, I have written several letters to the heads of the National Cancer Institute [NCI], asking that it reconsider its position on mammography screening for women between the ages of 40 and 49. 
We have seen study after study that shows that mammography screening at an earlier age can help save women's lives. Women and physicians have come to depend on the recommendations of the NCI in determining when they should begin mammography screening. 
NCI's decision to back away from screening for women between the ages of 40 and 49 has led to confusion and anxiety. I applaud Dr. Klausner, head of the NCI, for convening the advisory panel. But like him, I am disappointed that the panel issued no concrete guidelines to aid women and their doctors. 
Since we cannot prevent or cure breast cancer, mammography screening remains the best tool we have to detect it early when chances for survival are highest. We cannot now eliminate the only hope younger women have for fighting this dreaded disease. 
This resolution is an important step in the right direction. The NCI needs to recognize the importance of mammograms for women in their forties and reissue its previous guidelines.

Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am delighted that the Senate will give its approval today to the nomination of William M. Daley to be Secretary of Commerce. 
Mr. Daley is with the Chicago, IL, law firm of Mayer, Brown & Platt. He previously served as the president and chief operating officer of Amalgamated Bank of Chicago, and as special counsel to the President for the North American Free-Trade Agreement. I believe Mr. Daley's background and experiences will be of tremendous benefit to America's businesses as they navigate their way through the global economic marketplace in which they now operate. 
It is particularly important to my home State of California that the Department of Commerce have a strong and effective leader. Bill Daley will be such a leader. 
California is the Nation's leading exporter. Last year, California accounted for 16 percent--$90 billion--of the Nation's exports, an increase of almost $14 billion over the 1994 levels. This tremendous amount of exports supported approximately 1 million Californian jobs. From the period 1987 to 1995, California realized the largest dollar growth in merchandise exports--$59.1 billion--of any State. As a member of the International Finance Subcommittee, I look forward to working with Secretary Daley on the issue of exports and on a host of other issues of importance to the businesses in my home State of California. 
In addition to the issues facing California businesses, there are also many significant and important issues, and challenges, facing our Nation as a whole as we move forward into the 21st century and begin to shift from an industrial base to a technological base in an information society. Bill Daley has the know-how, vision, and leadership necessary to effectively guide us across the bridge into the 21st century.

Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I want to brief the Senate on an issue that is gaining steam in my home State of California, because, if it is resolved, it will result in about $80 million going directly into the school system in California to help the children there. 
This issue involves the underestimation by oil companies of royalties that they owe the Federal Government from crude oil that they have pumped. They have underestimated these royalties and have been sent a bill by the Department of the Interior, and they have not yet paid. 
At this point the amount owed is $385 million. We expect it will go up to $440 million. 
Ten oil companies, the largest one being Shell, have been sent their bills. Shell Oil's bill is over $100 million. Those funds will go to the U.S. Treasury, and then a portion of those funds will go to the States in which the oil was pumped. California is the place where most of that oil comes from; and California will get between $75 and $80 million from the Federal Government when those funds are collected. 
In California we have a law that the royalties all go to the State Schools Fund. I really hate to see years of protracted litigation, Mr. President, on this matter. 
The oil companies are not cooperating. Many of them have refused the subpoenas. They are disregarding the subpoenas sent to them. The Justice Department is now involved. I hope that instead of being deadbeat oil companies, they will pay up. If they feel they have a case that the bills are too high, they can fight that out. They can try to settle it. But they should at least cooperate and begin paying some of what is owed. 
Mr. President, I can tell you, the $75 to $80 million to California schools would mean that we could hire an additional 1,000 teachers or buy 40,000 computers. The children deserve that. 
For Orange County alone the underpayments total more than $5 million; for Los Angeles, $18 million; for San Diego, $5 million; for Fresno, $2.25 million. 
So I appeal to these oil companies, do right for our children, pay what you owe. Be good citizens, cooperate in this investigation, make some payments, work with us so that our children can get a better education. 
I hope the people of this country will write to the CEO of Shell, will write to the CEO of Oryx, of Marathon, of Mobil and tell those CEO's that we are all in this together and that when an individual family gets a bill, when they do not pay it, they cannot stall, they cannot afford to hire lawyers. If, in fact, the individual says, `Well, I paid it,' you know what you would do as a family member; you would say, `Here's my canceled check. I've paid this,' or, `Come and look at this. This is a mistake.' 
That is not what these oil companies are doing. Three of them complied with the subpoenas, but five are fighting them. So I feel, Mr. President, this is an issue that deserves attention. 
I am very pleased that Cynthia Quarterman, the Director of the Mineral Management Services, and Bob Armstrong are working on this case. They are going forward to collect these sums. They have written a new rule so that in the future there will not be any confusion about what is owed. 
So I look forward to a successful conclusion, and I really do think if the people of this country and citizens of California write to these oil companies, maybe we will see some of these payments. 
Thank you very much, Mr. President. I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am very pleased about President Clinton's nomination of Andrew Cuomo for Secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development, and am delighted to support this nomination. 
Secretary-designate Cuomo's accomplishments in the private sector and as Assistant Secretary of HUD's Office of Community Planning and Development are numerous. Housing assistance systems developed by Andrew Cuomo have served as model systems, achieving success all across this Nation. 
At his hearing last week, Secretary-designate Cuomo showed his knowledge, not only of the management problems within HUD, but of the substantive programs as well. Moreover, Secretary-designate Cuomo expressed his vision for HUD with a refreshing realism. He understands HUD's mission, and the limited discretionary spending to achieve the goals of providing housing assistance in this country. 
The issues I am primarily concerned about working on were clearly understood by the Secretary-designate. California faces the brunt of the burden with regard to section 8 renewals, preservation, and the impact of welfare reform on housing. Another issue I will continue to try and resolve with HUD and the Veterans' Administration is homelessness among veterans who fought this country's wars. 
I believe Andrew Cuomo is distinctly qualified to be Secretary of HUD. The Secretary-designate has been with HUD in a leadership capacity since 1993. He worked closely with outgoing Secretary Henry Cisneros and understands the complex matrix that makes up HUD's existing programs. From his background, experience, and responses at his nomination hearing last week, Mr. Cuomo has shown he understands what it will take to improve upon that matrix. 
Americans all across this Nation, in both urban and rural areas, can expect changes positively affecting housing assistance. Again, I fully support Mr. Cuomo's nomination as Secretary of HUD. 
Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, last week, Senators Stevens and Breaux introduced a bill S. 39, that would significantly weaken protections for dolphins in the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean by rewriting--gutting--the `dolphin safe' tuna labeling law that Senator Biden and I wrote and urged into law in 1990. 
Today, the $1 billion U.S. canned tuna market is a dolphin safe market. Consumers know that the dolphin safe label means that dolphins were not chased, harassed, captured, or killed. 
Our definition of dolphin safe became law for all the right reasons. Those reasons are still valid today: 
First, for the consumers, who were opposed to the encirclement of dolphins with purse seine nets and wanted guarantees that the tuna they consume did not result in harassment, capture, and killing of dolphins; second, for the U.S. tuna companies, who wanted a uniform definition that would not undercut their voluntary efforts to remain dolphin-safe; third, for the dolphins, to avoid harassment, injury and deaths by encirclement; and fourth, for truth in labeling. 
Our law has been a huge success. Annual dolphin deaths have declined from 60,000 in 1990 to under 3,000 in 1995. Why mess with success? 
The Stevens-Breaux bill would permit more dolphins to be killed than are killed now. 
The bill promotes the chasing and encirclement of dolphins, a tuna fishing practice that is very dangerous to dolphins. It does so by gutting the meaning of dolphin safe, the label which must appear on all tuna sold in the United States. The `dolphin safe' label has worked: it doesn't need to be updated, as the bill's sponsors claim. 
A number of arguments have been made in support of the Stevens-Breaux bill which I would like refute at this time. 
1. ENVIRONMENTAL SUPPORT 
Bill supporters claim that it is supported by the environmental community. In fact, only a few environmental groups support the Stevens-Breaux bill, while over 85 environmental, consumer, animal protection, labor, and trade groups oppose the Stevens-Breaux bill. I ask unanimous consent to insert a list of these groups in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks. The fact is that the vast majority of environmental organizations in this country and around the world oppose the Stevens-Breaux bill. 
2. EMBARGO ON TUNA 
The bill's supporters say that it is unreasonable for the United States to continue to impose a unilateral embargo on other fishing nations that wish to sell tuna in our country. I agree. It is time to lift the embargo. That is why Senator Biden and I, and a number of our colleagues, introduced legislation in the last session of Congress that would lift the country by country embargo against tuna that is caught by dolphin safe methods. Our bill would give all tuna fishermen the opportunity to export to the U.S. market as long as they use dolphin safe practices. In other words, we would open the U.S. market and comply with international trade agreements without gutting U.S. dolphin protection laws. 
We have offered repeatedly over the past year to sit down and negotiate a compromise with the administration. We have stated repeatedly that we agree it is appropriate to lift the embargo. We want to reach a compromise that is in the best interest of the American consumer, dolphins, and our U.S. tuna processing industry. 
3. SCIENCE 
Supporters of the Stevens-Breaux bill believe that we should return to chasing and setting nets on dolphins because bycatch of other marine species is minimized. I believe that in order to sustain our renewable marine resources, we need to take a comprehensive ecosystem approach. I also recognize that management of a single species does not always produce benefits for the entire ecosystem. The bycatch of juvenile tuna and other marine species including endangered turtles, is an issue of concern that must be addressed. However, the bycatch arguments used by supporters of this bill are not based on solid science. We need more research before we can establish that bycatch is a problem.  
4. OBSERVERS ON BOATS 
Under the scheme supported by this bill, tuna fishing boats would continue to have only one observer on each. Currently, that one observer only has to observe whether or not a purse seine net was used on dolphins. If a net was deployed, the tuna caught on that fishing trip cannot be labeled `dolphin safe'. Under the scheme in the Stevens-Breaux bill, an observer would have to see whether there are any dead dolphins in the nets that are used to catch tuna. These nets are huge--1 1/2 miles long. How can we expect one single observer to know whether or not a dolphin died in a mile-and-a-half long net? This observer scheme would be 
unworkable and unenforceable. It also ignores all injuries to dolphin during the chase and encirclement process which can lead to eventual death. 
5. INTERNATIONAL OBLIGATION 
During the last session, the Panama Declaration was repeatedly referred to as a tuna-dolphin treaty, and it was suggested that unless the Senate passed the Stevens-Breaux bill, the United States was somehow reneging on a binding international agreement. This is simply untrue. It is a completely inaccurate characterization of the issue. 
Mr. President, there is no tuna-dolphin treaty. 
No treaty was signed by the United States or any other nation on the subject of tuna fishing and the killing of dolphins in the eastern tropical Pacific. 
No treaty was submitted to the Senate for ratification, as required by the Case-Zablocki Act. 
No treaty was referred to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. 
None of these things happened because there is no treaty. 
The agreement that the Stevens-Breaux bill relates to is neither a treaty nor an international agreement. The so-called Panama Declaration is only a political statement--an agreement to agree in the future on a binding international agreement. 
The declaration sets forth a series of principles which will ultimately be contained in this yet-to-be-drafted international agreement. But these principles are so vague and largely hortatory that they cannot possibly be read as imposing legal obligations. 
If there were any doubt that the United States did not intend to be bound by this declaration, we need only turn to the statement issued by the United States representative to the meeting in Panama.

Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am proud to support the nomination of Madeleine K. Albright for Secretary of State. Ambassador Albright is extremely well-qualified for this important post and will make a tremendous leader of the Clinton administration's foreign policy team. 
This nomination is truly historic. Ambassador Albright is the first woman ever nominated to be Secretary of State. She will not only become the most senior female appointee in this administration, but the highest ranking in the history of the United States. I am so very proud that today Madeleine Albright is shattering a glass ceiling that many thought would never be broken. 
Ambassador Albright will also be the first refugee to hold this important post. Having fled totalitarianism herself, Ambassador Albright is especially sensitive to the needs of newly emerging democracies. She is a beacon of hope to the hundreds of millions of people around the world who have recently shed the shackles of authoritarian government. 
Over the last 20 years, Ambassador Albright has worked tirelessly to promote a safer, more stable world. After working as a foreign policy advisor to the late Senator Edmund Muskie, she taught foreign policy at Georgetown University's School of Foreign Service. As U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations, she earned a reputation for toughness, fairness, and the tireless advocacy of American interests. 
Madeleine Albright is a diplomat, scholar, and a role model for the Nation's young people--especially our young women. I am confident that she will make an excellent Secretary of State and I proudly support her nomination.

Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today I am to introducing the American Handgun Standards Act, a bill to require that handguns made in the United States meet the same quality and safety standards currently required of imported handguns. I am joined in this effort by Senators John Chafee, Jack Reed, and Dick Durbin. 
This bill is aimed at junk guns--the cheap, unsafe, and easily concealable handguns that are the criminals' clear favorite. Under our bill, junk guns will no longer be allowed to be manufactured or sold in the United States of America. 
Nearly 30 years ago, Congress thought it had solved the problem of junk guns. Following the assassination of Senator Robert Kennedy, Congress passed the Gun Control Act of 1968, which banned the importation of junk guns. At the time, virtually all junk guns were imported, so restricting their domestic manufacture was not considered necessary. 
To implement the new law, a quality and safety test was designed to measure a gun's suitability for import. Any foreign-made firearm that fails this test is, by definition, a junk gun, and it cannot be imported into the United States. This bill would require that all handguns made in the United States pass this common sense quality and safety test. 
The Gun Control Act of 1968 created a junk gun double standard. Imported handguns were subjected to rigorous quality and safety standards, but guns made in the United States were left totally unregulated. Even toy guns are subject to quality and safety standards, but real handguns made in the United States are not required to meet even one. 
The need for strong action is clear. Gunshots are now the leading cause of death among children in California. A child dies from gunfire every 92 minutes in the United States. A total of 39,720 people died from gunshot wounds in 1994 and approximately 250,000 Americans were injured. If we were in a war with this many casualties, there would be protests in the streets to end it. Let us end now, end this junk gun war. 
For each person killed by gunfire, up to 8 are wounded. Many survivors of gun violence face debilitating injuries that require constant medical attention. The economic costs of gun violence are staggering. Direct medical costs alone cost Americans more than $20 billion. When indirect costs, such as lost productivity, are considered, the total economic cost of gun injuries soars to over $120 billion. 
I first introduced junk gun legislation less than a year ago. Since then, I have received support so strong that it has surpassed even my most optimistic hopes. More than two dozen California cities and counties have passed local ordinances banning junk gun sales, and my legislation has been endorsed by the California Police Chiefs Association and 36 individual police chiefs and sheriffs representing some of California's largest cities, including Los Angeles, San Francisco, San Jose and Sacramento. 
This legislation has generated such strong support in the law enforcement community because police know the danger of these junk guns first hand. They know that junk guns are the criminals' favorite firearms. 
Junk guns are 3.4 times as likely to be used in crimes as are other firearms. And newly compiled ATF data shows that in 1996, the three firearms most frequently traced at crime scenes were junk guns made in America.

Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, in March 1996 scores of volunteers throughout California helped make NetDay 96 one of the most successful one-day public projects in history. At the time, we all noted that this electronic barn-raising could be a turning point in educational history--but only if we followed through with other steps to help our children travel the information superhighway. I would like to take one step by introducing the Computer Donation Incentive Act of 1997. 
The successful education of America's children is closely linked to the use of innovative educational technologies, particularly computer-based instruction and research. Unfortunately, however, far too many public elementary and secondary school classrooms lack the computers they need to take advantage of these new educational technologies. 
The Computer Donation Incentive Act will help get our students those computers. Current law allows computer manufacturers to receive a greater deduction for donations of computers to college and universities, for scientific and research purposes, than for donations made to elementary and secondary schools for education purposes. That limitation may have made sense when this provision was enacted, before the personal computer boom, but not in the era of the Information Superhighway, such a limitation is unreasonable. 
The Computer Donation Incentive Act provides computer manufacturers the same enhanced deduction for donating computers for educational purposes that they currently receive for donating computers to colleges and universities for scientific purposes. Similarly, the bill will allow nonmanufacturers to receive a deduction for donating computers to elementary and secondary schools for educational use. 
The Boxer-Chafee bill will provide a reasonable incentive for businesses to donate computer to the schools. I would like to emphasize the donated computers must be nearly new; those donated by manufacturers must be no more than 2 year old, and those donated by nonmanufacturers must be no more than 3 year old. 
Along with computers and software, businesses should also donate their expertise, providing the training required to bring our schools fully on-line--and we challenge them to do so. Teachers and students both need such training in order to integrate computer-based lessons into their basic curriculum. 
Alone, neither NetDay nor an adjustment to the Tax Code can solve all our educational problems or even make every student computer literate for the next century. But together, each initiative we take will help provide our students with the tools they need to drive on the information Superhighway and compete in a global information-based marketplace. Such initiatives are investments in the futures of our children.

Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Domestic Violence Identification and Referral Act. 
Spousal abuse, child abuse, and elder abuse injures millions of Americans each year, and is growing at an alarming rate. An estimated 2 to 4 million women are beaten by their spouses or former spouses each year. In 1993, 2.9 million children were reported abused or neglected, about triple the number reported in 1980. Studies also showed that spouse abuse and child abuse often go hand-in-hand. 
Doctors, nurses, and other health care professionals are on the front lines of this abuse, but they cannot stop what they have been trained to see or talk about. The Domestic Violence Identification and Referral Act addresses this need by encouraging medical schools to incorporate training on domestic violence into their curriculums. 
There is a need for this legislation. While many medical specialities, hospitals, and other organizations have made education about domestic violence a priority, this instruction typically occurs on the job or as part of a continuing medical education program. A 1994 survey by the Association of American Medical Colleges [AAMC] found that 60 percent of medical school graduates rated the time devoted to instruction in domestic violence as inadequate. 
The bill I am introducing today would give preference in Federal funding to those medical and other health professional schools which provide significant training in domestic violence. It defines significant training to include identifying victims of domestic violence and maintaining complete medical records, providing medical advice regarding the dynamics and nature of domestic violence, and referring victims to appropriate public and nonprofit entities for assistance. 
The bill also defines domestic violence in the broadest terms, to include battering, child abuse and elder abuse. 
I hope my colleagues agree that this legislation is a critical next step in the fight to bring the brutality of domestic violence out in the open. It mobilizes our Nation's health care providers to recognize and treat its victims--and will ultimately save lives by helping to break the cycle of violence.

Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today I am introducing three bills designed to protect Americans' pension funds. 
I. THE 401(K) PENSION PLAN PROTECTION ACT 
The first bill, the `401(k) Pension Plan Protection Act of 1997', would give employees who participate in a 401(k) plan the assurance that their employer cannot force them to invest their employee contributions in the company. 
The 401(k) Pension Protection Act will increase employees' investment freedom and protect employees against low yielding and undiversified 401(k) investments in their employer. It allows employees to protect themselves against loss of jobs and pensions if their employer becomes bankrupt. 
Unfortunately, such losses have already occurred. A year ago, Color Tile, -Inc., a nationwide retailer of floor and counter coverings, filed bankruptcy. Color Tile had one pension plan, a 401(k) plan. The 401(k) allowed employees no choice of investments. All investment decisions were made by Color Tile. 
At the time of bankruptcy, 83 percent of the 401(k)'s investments were in 44 Color Tile stores. Many of those stores were closed in the bankruptcy. Those investments--and the employees retirement savings--are now at risk of a large, possibly total loss. 
In 1991, in my own State, another bankruptcy resulted in a substantial loss to a 401(k) plan enrolling 10,000 employees. Carter Hawley Hales stores went bankrupt with more than 50 percent of its assets invested in Carter Hawley Hale stock. As a result of the bankruptcy, the stock lost 92 percent of its value. Many employees lost a pension and a job simultaneously. 
The 401(k) Pension Protection Act is designed to prevent situations such as Color Tile and Carter Hawley Hale from reoccurring. The act would prevent a company from requiring that more than 10 percent of employee contributions to a 401(k) plan, contributions known as salary deferrals, be invested in the 
employer stock or employer real estate. 
The act exempts a certain type of 401(k) plan from the 10 percent limit--where employees are free to direct how their contributions are invested and to move their investments in the 401(k) with reasonable frequency. In such situations, the 10 percent limitation does not apply and employees are free to assume the risk of undiversified investment in their employer. 
The 401(k) Pension Protection Act would protect 23 million employees in 401(k) plans investing more than 675 million dollars in assets. 
All 401(k) members need the 401(k) Pension Protection Act. Unlike traditional pension plans, companies sponsoring 401(k)s do not guarantee that investments will provide the promised pension. Instead, 401(k) participants bear all risk of undiversified investment in the employer. 
Participants in 401(k)s also need the protections of the act because--unlike traditional pension plans--401(k)s are not insured against bankruptcy of the plan sponsor by the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp., or PBGC. 
II. THE PENSION BENEFITS FAIRNESS ACT OF 1997 
The second bill that I offer today is the Pension Benefits Fairness Act of 1997. The act would require that traditional pension plans offer equal survivor retirement benefits to both spouses. 
Current Federal law requires an unequal survivors retirement benefit option. Unless they voluntarily offer a better benefit, traditional pension plans are required to offer a benefit option that pays one spouse double the amount paid to other spouse, when one spouse dies. Many plans do not voluntarily offer an equal benefit. 
Current law also requires that only one spouse be given a description of the retirement benefit option or options offered by the plan. This leaves one spouse in a marriage uninformed of a decision that affects their income for the rest of their life. It is doubly important that they understand the decision to accept a particular benefit because they can never change their decision. 
Under current law, the spouse who gets the required description is also the spouse who gets a survivor benefit that is twice as large. 
The preferred spouse is the spouse who participated in the retirement plan. This means that the unequal treatment disproportionately impacts women because women's jobs are less often covered by a pension plan. Women need better pension survivor benefits because three out of four marriages they outlive their husbands 
The Pension Benefits Fairness Act would correct this problem by requiring that pension plans treat spouses equally with regard to benefits and disclosure of benefit options. 
The act imposes no additional pension costs on plans, employers, or participants. The act would increase the benefits paid to the many surviving spouses while resulting in no material reduction in the pension paid to a typical couple. 
III. THE SMALL 401(K) PENSION PLAN DISCLOSURE ACT OF 1997 
The third pension bill that I introduce today is the Small 401(k) Pension Plan Disclosure Act of 1997. 
Current Federal law requires that pension plans file an annual investment report with the Department of Treasury and make the report available if a participant asks for it. Participants in small 401(k)s should not be required to ask where their pension contributions are invested. Participants in small 401(k)s are often hesitant to request the information for fear of being identified as questioning their employer's handling of a 401(k). Participants in large plans, where there is greater anonymity, are less hesitant. 
Participants in 401(k)s should know where their plan is invested. Unlike traditional, defined pension plan participants, 401(k) participants have neither a plan sponsor's guarantee nor PBGC insurance against poor investment return. Participants bear the risk themselves. 
It is only fair that 401(k) participants be informed how their money is invested. 
The Small 401(k) Pension Plan Disclosure Act of 1997 eliminates the need to ask. It requires that the Secretary of Labor issue regulations requiring that small 401(k)s to provide each participant with an annual investment report. The details of the report are left to the Secretary, but certain details are suggested as a guide. 
The act also encourages the Secretary to provide for the delivery of reports through company e-mail. This should help minimize the cost of providing reports. 
The act exempts 401(k) accounts where participants direct their investments because current law already requires that those participants receive investment descriptions and reports. 
Mr. President, these bills increase the retirement security of the American work force, diversify 401(k) investments, require equal benefits for husband and wife, and inform employees in small 401(k) plans where their money is invested.

 Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, it is with great pleasure that I rise today to pay tribute to Cruz Bustamante, the newly elected speaker of the California Assembly. 
Speaker Bustamante is a native Californian, born in Dinuba and raised in the great Central Valley, where he still lives and represents the 31st District. He graduated from Tranquility High School and attended Fresno City College and California State University at Fresno. He has had a career marked by community service, having worked in various employment and training programs. 
He understands his community well, having served on numerous boards and commissions including the Fresno United Way Allocation Committee, Burroughs Elementary School Site Committee, City of Fresno Citizens Advisory Committee and the Roosevelt Plan Implementation Committee. 
In addition to his extensive experience in state and local government and organizations, he also has a firm understanding of the workings of Congress and the Federal Government. Early in his career, he served as a summer intern in former Congressman B. F. Sisk's office. He later worked as district representative for former Congressman Richard Lehman. 
Cruz Bustamante is California's first Assembly Speaker of Latino heritage. He is a modern day pioneer. California is home to millions of Latinos and others of various ethnic backgrounds. Mr. Bustamante's speakership heralds new horizons for every Californian concerned with the future of our ever changing State. 
So today, I ask my colleagues in the United States Senate to join me and Speaker Bustamante's wife Arcelia, their daughters and grandchildren, his colleagues, constituents and numerous other supporters in wishing him every success as he meets this challenge. 
Cruz Bustamante has been described by Republicans and Democrats alike as an intelligent and able leader. He has said that his tenure as Speaker will focus on the needs of the people of California. I look forward to working with him on behalf of all Californians, and I look forward to a continuing story of success for California's new Assembly Speaker, Cruz Bustamente.
