   Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I am pleased this morning that the Senate thus far is functioning the way it should when it comes to new controversial matters such as my State's physician-assisted suicide law. I have been forced to filibuster the tax bill since late last week because at that time there was an effort to stuff the Nickles legislation into that package in the dead of night. This legislation troubles me greatly because I believe it will cause unnecessary suffering for patients in every corner of the country. It involves law enforcement--specifically, the Drug Enforcement Administration--in a process that is so sensitive with respect to helping patients who are suffering around our country. 
   This legislation has never been marked up by the committee of jurisdiction in the Senate. It has never been open to amendment by the Senate. It has not cleared even one of the traditional hurdles to which important legislation is subjected when it is introduced in the Senate. 
   This is legislation that has over 50 leading health organizations, including the American Cancer Society, stating that it is going to hurt pain care for the dying. It is also fair to say that the senior Senator from Oklahoma, Mr. NICKLES, has a number of organizations that support his efforts. When we have  a number of organizations, respected organizations, that disagree about a very sensitive, totally new issue before the Congress, the Senate certainly should move carefully to evaluate the consequences of its actions. 
   I spoke with the President of the United States about this matter twice on Monday. I was pleased to read the comments of the President expressing concern about the bill's impact on pain care and on physicians. I am absolutely convinced that if this legislation were to become law, there would be many health care providers in this country who are opposed to physician-assisted suicide, as I am, who would be very fearful about treating pain aggressively because the Nickles legislation criminalizes decisions with respect to pain management. 
   The people of Oregon, who have a ballot in their hand such as this one right now, want to know that this ballot really counts. The people of Oregon, in coffee shops and beauty parlors all over the State, when they are considering how to vote right now, are asking themselves: Does this ballot really count? When we vote on a matter that is critical to us, particularly on a measure that has historically been left to the States, we want to make sure that people 3,000 miles away won't substitute their personal moral and religious beliefs for ours on a matter that has historically been left to us to decide. 
   I can tell the people of Oregon now that their vote still counts. As of today, whether you vote for my party or the party of Senator NICKLES, it doesn't matter. This ballot, as of this morning in the State of Oregon, still counts, regardless of whether you are a Democrat or a Republican, a Liberal, a Conservative, Independent. Regardless of your political persuasion, as of now in the State of Oregon, this ballot still counts. 
   Your vote is important. I hope folks at home exercise that right. Their vote still means something. I am going to do my best to see that it continues to count when Congress reconvenes after the election. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. WYDEN. I appreciate my colleague yielding. I thank him for the extraordinary bipartisan approach he has taken throughout this session. 
   I think 18 months ago, when the session began and we were tackling the county payments question, particularly rural schools and roads, nobody thought we could put together a bipartisan coalition. Two sides were completely dug in. One side said we should totally divorce these payments from any connection to the land; others went the other way and said let's try to incentivize a higher cut. I believe the Senator from Idaho, in giving me the opportunity that he has as the ranking Democrat on the forestry subcommittee, has shown that we can take a fresh approach on these natural resources issues--in particular, timber. 
   I appreciate my colleague yielding me the time. I am looking forward to working with him again next session because it was an exhilarating moment to have the first major natural resources bill in decades come to the floor of the Senate, as our legislation did. 
   I thank my colleague for letting me intrude on his time. I have had a chance to be part of a historic effort with my friend from Idaho, and it has been a special part of my public service. I thank him for that.

I would have to have unanimous consent that at the conclusion of Senator GRAMM's remarks, I be recognized next to speak, and that I be allowed to address several issues before there are any votes that go forward. I am concerned about a number of issues. As the majority leader knows, I have dedicated my service here to bipartisanship. I happen to agree with the distinguished majority leader that no one  ever gets everything they want in a package. Senator KERRY showed that Democrats are willing to bend over backward to be bipartisan in areas such as small business. But on a number of issues that concern this Senator, there has not been that level of bipartisanship. I am compelled to object and will need to speak at some length this morning on the several issues that are important to me.

   Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, before he leaves the floor, I thank the Senator from Massachusetts, both for his focus on bipartisanship with respect to the overall package and for his very thoughtful comments about the assisted suicide issue. I think he has summed it up very well. 
   I feel bad that I had to object to consideration of the tax legislation this morning. I will take just a minute or two to describe why and then go on to talk about the overall issue as it relates to pain relief and what is in the tax bill. 
   I know it is an inconvenience to a number of Senators to have me talk about this subject at length. This is an important time in the year for colleagues. I regret the inconvenience. But I believe what is in the tax bill is going to cause so much pain and suffering to families all across the country, that the interests of those families who are going to suffer if this tax bill as written becomes law have to come first. 
   First and foremost, I want the Senate to understand that before we are done, I am going to speak at length about exactly what the consequences will be for families all across this country, who needlessly are going to suffer great pain that could be averted, if the bill becomes law as written. 
   In addition, while the majority leadership in the Congress is attempting to throw Oregon's vote on assisted suicide into the trash can, Oregonians are holding on to ballots such as this one. They are wondering if this ballot, this sacred vote, really counts.

The fact is, the senior Senator from Oklahoma has put into the tax bill legislation that would silence over a million Oregon voices. I am going to be here to make sure those voices are heard. 
   I yield to the Senator from Nevada. I thank him for his thoughtful comments last night on this issue.

   What is so striking--and I appreciate the Senator's question--is that we constantly have colleagues come to the floor and talk about the importance of States rights and the beauty of the 10th amendment. Then when they don't happen to agree with what a State is doing, I guess the 10th amendment isn't so important anymore. 
   I appreciate the Senator's question.

   Mr. WYDEN. The Senator is absolutely right. People in Nevada should understand that what this legislation does is take away from all States what has historically been their prerogative, which is to determine appropriate medical practice. There is a great body of case law and a variety of legal precedents that establish that right, and folks in Nevada should understand that. I think it is also on point to note that people in Maine are voting right now on this issue. I think it is open to some question as to what will be the effect of that Maine ballot measure right now if the tax legislation were to pass as written and, in effect, throw Oregon folk to the trash can, and it might do the same thing for people in Maine. I thank my colleague for his questions. 
   Mr. President, if the Senate was here today to vote on a stand-alone bill which would lead to unspeakable, avoidable suffering for hundreds of thousands of terminally ill citizens, there is no question in my mind that the Senate would not pass it. So what we have to ask is why has the Senate leadership stuck into this tax bill, legislation that the American Cancer Society and over 50 nationally recognized health organizations believe will cause unnecessary suffering for thousands of terminally ill citizens in each State in our country. 
   What is particularly ironic is that this legislation has not moved forward with any of the traditional procedures of the Senate. It has never been reported out by a committee of jurisdiction. It has never been subject to amendment by the full Senate. There has never been a chance to debate it on the floor of the Senate. The fact is that this legislation, which is one of the central bioethical questions in our society, was stuffed into the tax bill close to midnight the other night, without overcoming even one of the traditional procedures the Senate follows. 
   Now, Senator KERRY noted the name of this bill. It is the so-called ``Pain Relief Promotion Act.'' The fact of the matter is, this legislation is really the ``Pain Promotion Act'' because it is going to have a chilling effect on health care providers all across this country who simply want to practice good pain management. 
   I know my friend from Colorado, who is in the Chair today, also represents a rural State. Let me tell you about the kind of concern I have if the Nickles bill, as written, becomes law. Let us say you have a physician in Colorado or in Iowa or another rural State who is opposed to assisted suicide--and I am opposed to assisted suicide; I have joined colleagues here in voting to ban Federal funding of assisted suicide. But let's say a physician in Colorado, who is opposed to assisted suicide, wants to treat pain aggressively with a suffering patient. If they do, their intent, their mental calculus can later be dissected by law enforcement officials who, if they believe that anti-assisted suicide physician really had a different intent, can prosecute that physician. And the medical providers involved would be subject to a mandatory minimum sentence of 20 years, a fine that is upwards of a million dollars and they would lose their DEA registration. 
   The fact is that the undertreatment of pain today is a documented public health crisis. There was just another survey published very recently demonstrating that physicians and health care providers are reluctant to treat pain aggressively because they are very fearful of having their decisions second-guessed by law enforcement. There are a number of us--the American Cancer Society is one--who are opposed to assisted suicide. Yet the American Cancer Society has said that because of the chilling ramifications of pain management, it believes the Nickles legislation included in the tax bill is going to hurt cancer patients nationwide. 
   The American Academy of Family Physicians is another major medical group opposed to assisted suicide and they oppose the Nickles legislation; so is the American Nurses Association, the Oncology Nursing Society, the Indiana State Hospice and Palliative 
   Care Association, and the Texas Medical Association. In sum, there are more than 50 respected health organizations that are opposed to physician-assisted suicide and also oppose the Nickles legislation included in this tax bill. 
   If we do care about humane medical treatment--and I know that every Senator cares about the suffering of those who are vulnerable--I believe when you actually read what is in this tax bill and what Senator NICKLES has been able to include, if you wish to join us in alleviating suffering and protecting the poor, elderly, and vulnerable, you have to oppose the Nickles legislation because it hurts the very people that our colleagues care about. 
   I want to raise a troublesome flag now with respect to this bill. To my knowledge, not a single nursing organization in America supports the bill purporting to relieve pain for the dying--not one. But seven nursing organizations, including the American Nurses Association, National Association of Hospice and Palliative Nurses, Pediatric Oncology Nurses, and the American Society of Pain Management Nurses, oppose the alleged pain relief bill included in this tax legislation. 
   Now, you know when a loved one is in a hospital, the physician may have ultimate responsibility for the care, but the nurses are the ones on the front lines coping with pain. Seven major nursing organizations, representing those on the front lines, have come out against the Nickles bill. So the question is, how could all of this happen? I think the Senate may want to reflect on the procedures involved because I think other Senators may find the same sort of absurd process applied in matters that are important to their States. 
   When Senator NICKLES introduced the Pain Relief Promotion Act last year, the bill was referred to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions. That is because, for obvious reasons, the bill has enormous ramifications for pain and health care. The bill received a hearing in 1999. It wasn't acted on by the committee. Members on both sides of the aisle expressed concerns about the legislation's impact on end-of-life and pain care. Unfortunately, a House bill identical to that legislation was passed by the House and was suddenly referred to the Senate Judiciary Committee, which didn't have jurisdiction on this critical health issue. The Parliamentarian did something that I believe showed great courage, and I commend him for it. He simply told the news media that a mistake had been made, 
   that the Nickles legislation had been referred to the wrong committee. 
   I thought it was a very courageous, gutsy thing for the Parliamentarian to do. It was the kind of unfortunate accident that can happen. 
   The Judiciary Committee, as one might guess, had a chairman who was sympathetic to the Nickles legislation who pushed and pushed to mark it up before the American Cancer Society made it clear that the Nickles legislation would hurt cancer patients. They got the bill out of the Judiciary Committee on a 10-8 vote. 
   Now you know that the bill is very controversial. That is why it is coming to the floor of the Senate in the form it is. They could not get the Senate to approve this legislation if the traditional procedure of the Senate were followed. 
   In fact, since the Nickles legislation had been introduced with a handful of Democrats who were supportive, several have now indicated their opposition largely for the reasons I have cited--that the Nickles legislation would have a chilling effect on pain management.  
   The reason this bill has been stuffed into the tax legislation is that it cannot go forward on its own. There is too much controversy attached to it, too much uncertainty about its ramifications on pain care for the dying for the leadership to bring it to the floor in the normal way. 
   The fact is that the Senator from Oklahoma doesn't have the votes. At one point, the supporters had 80 votes. It got out of the Judiciary Committee 10-8. 
   I said last summer, let's follow the traditional rules of the Senate. After we had agreed to that, the distinguished Senator from New York, who is very opposed to assisted suicide, saw how much damage this legislation would do for the suffering and said he couldn't support the bill. 
   Senator NICKLES saw that support was quickly moving away from him and that he didn't have the votes to pass his legislation following the traditional procedure of the Senate. To compensate for the lack of votes and the inability to follow traditional procedures in the Senate, the senior Senator from Oklahoma has chosen the least democratic method at his disposal to circumvent an honest debate and avoid even a couple of modest amendments. 
   What is striking is the senior Senator from Oklahoma has on various occasions apparently said we shouldn't have extraneous matters brought in that had not been considered separately in a conference report. But he is allowing exactly this to be done with his bill. 
   The senior Senator from Oklahoma is betting that by stuffing his legislation into this conference report, everybody is going to be so resigned to the outcome and so anxious to bring down the gavel and get home that this body is just going to ignore its obligation to the scores and scores of families and suffering patients who are going to be hurt by this legislation. 
   The senior Senator from Oklahoma may be right. I suppose that is the way it often works in the Senate. However, I am going to be asking my colleagues--and will talk more about this subject when we get back on the tax legislation--to step up to the suffering with so much on the line. I want them to know what is at stake. 
   If this legislation is approved, the friends of every Senator, loved ones, and constituents are going to find it impossible to obtain aggressive pain care in their communities. Patients unable to obtain pain care are a fact of life right now, but at least we have some solace in knowing that thousands of brave health professionals are willing to risk their reputations and their careers to prescribe controlled substances to relieve suffering. 
   If the tax legislation goes forward without removing the Nickles bill, the undertreatment of pain, which is already a 
   documented public health crisis, is going to get worse. Our loved ones--yours, mine--and individuals in every community across this country are going to suffer the consequences with this flawed legislation. 
   I hope that before we have a final vote on this issue, each and every one of our colleagues will read the statement of the American Cancer Society on this legislation. They are an organization that opposes assisted suicide, as I do. Yet here is what they say about the Nickles legislation. This is the direct statement of the American Cancer Society about the Nickles legislation. The American Cancer Society states, and I quote:  
   Under the act, all physicians, and particularly physicians who care for those with terminal illnesses, will be made especially vulnerable to having their pain and symptom management treatment decisions questioned by law enforcement officials not qualified to judge medical decision-making. This can result in unnecessary investigation and further disincentive to aggressively treat pain.  
   That is the American Cancer Society describing how the Nickles legislation will have a chilling effect on pain care. 
   I would like to offer a bit of a historical perspective. The nonprescription abuse of opioids and cocaine around the turn of the century and the growing sentiment that doctors at that time were one component of the growing drug problem in America helped contribute to the stigma associated with the use of opioids for pain. 
   According to a seminar on oncology and in an article by Dr. David Wiseman, ``Doctors, Opioids, and the Law: The Effect of Controlled Substances Regulation on Cancer Pain Management,'' when regulations were enacted in 1914 to keep from treating drug addicts with opioids, the stigma attached to those drugs continued to grow, and physicians across the country became more reticent to prescribe those drugs because of their fear of criminal or licensing sanctions against their practice. 
   The undertreatment of pain is due to a variety of complex causes. There certainly are a number of studies that show that the threat of legal sanctions is one of the main roadblocks to humane pain control. And that is before the Nickles legislation in the Senate would direct to Drug Enforcement Administration to have law enforcement agents second-guessing the judgment of doctors. 
   One 1994 California survey showed that 69 percent of physicians cited the potential for disciplinary action as a reason for prescribing opioids conservatively. One-third of the doctors went on to acknowledge that their own patients may be suffering from untreated pain. 
   What we saw last week in Oregon was a brand new study that showed again that physicians are fearful about aggressively treating pain for fear of legal prosecution. It confirmed the 1994 California survey. 
   For that reason, I am happy to yield to my friend and colleague.

   Mr. WYDEN. I appreciate my colleague's questions. There are more than 50 major health organizations. The American Cancer Society has stated why they feel this legislation would have a chilling effect on pain management. 
   I want my colleague to know, because time is short, that Senator NICKLES, in offering this bill, says doctors don't have anything to worry about with respect to prosecution under the bill--that his legislation says doctors can prescribe drugs which will hasten death if their intent is to treat the pain. So he is talking about ``intent.'' 
   Our colleagues are right to be so concerned about who is going to determine the intent of the physician, who is just trying to help somebody suffering and gives a suffering person critical relief and dignity as they face difficult hours at the end-of-life. The person who is going to decide ``intent'' is not another doctor, not a nurse, not a health professional, not anybody with medical  training, but law enforcement officials. A law enforcement official is going to determine that medical provider's' intent. Somebody with no medical training is going to, in effect, have the authority to put medical providers on trial; a trial that could cause a provider to lose their license, serve 20 years in prison, and face upwards of a $1 million fine. 
   It doesn't have to be this way. There are many who oppose assisted suicide, who want to work in a bipartisan way to promote better pain management and reduce the demand for assisted suicide.

   Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I will keep talking if the Senator from Missouri objects. I am sure some of our colleagues have other concerns. 
   I will continue on this question of dissecting medical providers' intent, as the Nickles legislation does, a dissecting exercise that will be done by law enforcement professionals rather than medical providers. 
   Here is what the American Cancer Society had to say about determining ``intent'' under the Nickles legislation. The American Cancer Society says: Unfortunately, intent cannot be easily determined, particularly in the area of medicine, where effective dosage levels for patients may deviate significantly from the norm. The question of deciding intent should remain in the hands of those properly trained to make such decisions--the medical community and State medical boards. 
   What the American Cancer Society is saying, as with these other 50 organizations, they are especially troubled that the Nickles legislation is second-guessing the pain management practices of physicians and providers all across the country. It is especially troublesome because law enforcement officials, rather than health care professionals, are going to be the ones to assess the intent of a medical provider. A medical providers' intentions under any calculus, as the American Cancer Society has noted, cannot be easily determined. To allow law enforcement officials to have this enormous discretion, after the fact, to challenge our medical providers, in my view, is going to significantly compound the undertreatment of pain in America.

   Mr. WYDEN. I thank my colleague. Mr. President, I think Senator DASCHLE has given an excellent statement tonight and has come back to what I think is the central concern of our time, and that is that the people of this country want to see bipartisan cooperation on all the central matters that are before the country. 
   I want to ask the Senator a question about the process. I will be very brief because I know the Senator from Missouri has been anxious to talk and has been very patient. 
   The tax legislation before us directs Federal law enforcement officials to criminalize the pain management decisions of our health care providers in an effort to throw Oregon's assisted-suicide law into the trash can. More than 50 major health organizations have said that they oppose this effort in this legislation because they believe the bill before us is going to have a chilling effect on pain management. 
   I am going to have a whole lot more to say about this subject tomorrow. Tonight I will be very brief. It seems to me what Senator DASCHLE is saying tonight--and I am interested in his thoughts--is that on an issue such as this, one of the most important bioethical decisions of our time, what the Senate ought to do is have a real debate, a real discussion, a chance to work in a bipartisan way rather than proceeding as we are now to establish new rules on one of the most sensitive, ethical, and social issues of our time without any opportunity to review it or modify it. 
   Is the Senator from South Dakota just saying he wants Government to operate in a fashion along the lines of what the American people expect on these central and very difficult issues?

   I ask the minority leader, as we go forward in this debate, because I intend to talk for a long time about this tomorrow, is it the Senator's desire that at least we could try tomorrow to have a discussion on this extraordinarily important social and ethical question?

   This legislation is another good example of the Oregon way: bringing together varied interests to get win-win results for all stakeholders. Born out of controversy concerning the detrimental effects of the Savage Rapids Dam on fish passage and survival, this legislation is now supported by the Grants Pass Irrigation District, Waterwatch, Oregon's Governor Kitzhaber, Trout Unlimited, and various Oregon river guide and sport fishing concerns. 
   The winners under this legislation are Oregon's environmental and agricultural interests. The legislation begins the important process of restoring salmon habitat on the Rogue River, while retaining access to necessary irrigation water from the Rogue River for the Grants Pass Irrigation District. The legislation authorizes the acquisition by the Secretary of Interior of the Savage Rapids Dam for the purpose of removing the Dam to promote the recovery of coastal salmon. But prior to that acquisition, the legislation directs the Secretary of Interior, through the Bureau of Reclamation, to design and install modern electric irrigation pumps for the Grants Pass Irrigation District so they may continue to access Rogue River water for crop irrigation, as they have done since 1921. 
   This legislation is good for irrigators: by maintaining water accessibility, it will help sustain local agricultural businesses. It is good for fish because it takes important steps toward habitat restoration by authorizing Dam removal as well as the monitoring, mitigation, and restoration activities necessary to restore the fish population in on the Rogue River. 
   I look forward to continuing to improve the legislation with my colleagues in the Senate and the stakeholders at home. As I work over the recess and on into the next Congress on this issue, I know, eventually, we will have another win for the Oregon way.

    Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I wish to take a moment to pay tribute to Jim Hurd, the founding CEO of Planar Systems, who passed away this summer after a year-long battle with leukemia. Jim was a pioneering technical and business leader in the U.S. flat panel industry, and led Planar Systems of Beaverton, Oregon to become one of the largest flat panel display companies in the U.S. and Europe. Jim was actively involved at the national level in helping to shape federal policy on flat panel displays, and worked on the national flat panel initiative and in the formation of consortia to address critical issues for the flat panel display industry. 
   Mr. Hurd was a leader in Oregon's business community, serving as the Chair of the Oregon Council of the American Electronics Association. During his term in 1992, he helped develop the Oregon technical benchmark annual survey and conference. He was also active in supporting technical education efforts in Oregon, and was a member of the Board of Trustees of the Oregon Graduate Institute. For services to the industry and community, the American Electronics Association awarded Jim Oregon's technology executive of the year award in 1993. 
   A native of the Pacific Northeast, Jim was born in 1948 in Spokane, and grew up in Kennewick, Washington. He received his bachelors's degree in physics from Lewis & Clark College in Portland in 1970, where he met his wife Alice. Jim joined Tektronics Corporation soon after graduation. In 1983, Jim left Tektronics to co-found Planar Systems with Chris King and John Laney. Today, Planer employs over 850 people in the United States. Jim also lent his wisdom to help other start-up companies achieve success by serving on the Board of the Oregon Resource and Technology Development Fund, a state-sponsored venture capital fund. 
   Jim had a rare ability to balance his successful professional life with an active private life that included mountain climbing, running, bicycling, tennis, scuba diving and a love for auto racing. He was a wonderful husband to Alice and a terrific father to his sons, Owen and Peter. 
   Mr. Hurd will be missed by all of us who knew him.

   Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, my friend and colleague, Senator SMITH, has said it extremely well, and I know our colleague Senator REED is waiting to speak, so I, too, will be very brief. 
   My view is that this Steens legislation is a monumental wilderness triumph. This legislation creates for the first time in statute cow-free wilderness. In the past, wilderness designations allowed the continuation of historic grazing practices, but because the ranchers in the Steens recognize the delicate nature of this ecosystem and because they were willing to work with Democrats and Republicans in our congressional delegation, Congressman GREG WALDEN, Congressman PETER DEFAZIO, and so many of our colleagues, we were able to build a coalition for a truly historic approach to protecting our wilderness. 
   We were able to find acceptable alternative grazing sites. Almost 100,000 acres of the total wilderness designation is now going to be by law cow free. In my view, this is just an example, a precedent of how communities can work together to protect our treasures. 
   All across this country when there are debates about national monuments, the sides go into opposing and what amounts to warring camps, the decibel level gets very high, and there is an awful lot of finger pointing and accusations. 
   In Oregon, we did it differently. We came up with an Oregon solution. Like Senator SMITH, I am very proud of  what we have been able to achieve. This is a model that our delegation is going to use to tackle other critical natural resource questions and, frankly, we are especially proud tonight because we think that with our Steens bill, we set a model for other communities across this country. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, on October 4, 2000, I did not correctly state the American Cancer Society's position on S. 1272, when I stated that they ``..... strongly opposed ..... the Pain Relief Promotion Act.'' Their actual position, taken directly from their recent statement on the legislation, is as follows:  
   ..... The American Cancer Society appreciates the commitment shown by the sponsors of the legislation to address these issues, but unfortunately is unable to support this legislation as written ..... Careful analysis of the House-passed measure and a substitute version of the Senate bill ..... have serious potential to exacerbate the current problem of under treatment of pain. While there are provisions to proactively address pain and symptom management, the Society maintains that any benefit from such provisions would not outweigh the potential threat posed by the changes to CSA. Furthermore, neither section of the bill comprehensively addresses the needs of providers, patients, and families for ongoing support and education to counter the current problem of under-treatment of pain--a problem that often leads to requests for physician-assisted suicide ..... Under the Act, all physicians and particularly physicians who care for those with terminal illnesses will be made especially vulnerable to having their pain and symptom management treatment decisions questioned by law enforcement officials not qualified to judge medical decision-making. This can result in unnecessary investigation, and further disincentives to aggressively treat pain. 
   Unfortunately, `intent' cannot be easily determined, particularly in the area of medicine where effective dosage levels for patients may deviate significantly from the norm. The question of deciding intent should remain in the hands of those properly trained to make such decisions--the medical community and state medical boards. The Pain Relief Promotion Act seeks to hold harmless any physician who treats a patient's pain even if death occurs, and the measure attempts to create a `safe harbor' provision in an effort to shield physicians whose use of federally-controlled drugs unintentionally hasten or cause death. However, this provision does not change the fact that the DEA would now explicitly be charged with overseeing the medical use of controlled substances, resulting in a negative impact on cancer pain treatment. . .  
   The American Cancer Society statement concluded with the following observation:  
   The American Cancer Society has engaged in a deliberative process to evaluate the impact of the Pain Relief Promotion Act on our Quality of Life goals for all people living with cancer. Its analysis included a review of existing Society policies on pain and symptom management and opposition to physician assisted suicide. We have concluded that as written, the Pain Relief Promotion Act would ban the use of federally controlled substances for physician-assisted suicide at the expense of controlling pain and advancing symptom management. These issues are both critically important, but are separate issues. While the Society strongly opposes all patient deaths stemming from assisted suicides, we must give heavier weight to the more than 1500 individuals who die of cancer every day in this country--more than half of whom die in pain unnecessarily. Moreover, the American Cancer Society believes that the best approach to help cancer patients and reduce and prevent assisted suicide is through the adoption of proactive policies and the provision of resources to prevent and ameliorate pain and suffering in people with cancer, especially for those at the end-of-life.  
   I appreciate this opportunity to clarify the position of the American Cancer Society on S. 1272.

   Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, twenty-two days ago I was here on the Senate floor helping to secure the support of 100 Senators in passing the Secure Rural Schools and Community Self-Determination Act of 2000. It was a good day for rural Americans when the Senate adopted S. 1608 unanimously. 
   Today is even better for rural Americans. A few minutes ago, the Senate passed legislation that now reflects an agreement among all stakeholders--the schools, the counties, the House and Senate and the Administration--that assures House and Senate passage and the President's signature. This bill is the winning formula for everyone concerned about rural communities. 
   The bill the Senate has passed is fundamentally unchanged from S. 1608. The basics are the same: the purposes, the funding formula, and the flexibility for counties to choose how to spend a portion of the payment. The bill will provide stable payments for education and roads in more than 750 timber-dependent counties across this country and real opportunities for environmental restoration on our national forests. 
   The bill will make sure our rural communities do not become economic sacrifice zones. It will help people in forest communities adapt to changing national forest management policies by creating a funding formula alternative to timber receipts. 
   Policy changes in Washington, D.C. affecting logging on national forests across this country have caused timber receipts to fall an average of 70 percent over the last 15 years, and by as much as 90 percent in some areas. As timber receipts disappeared, roads fell deeper into disrepair, school programs were cut to the bone, and some schools even had to close their doors at least one day a week. 
   This legislation will give rural communities a more predictable payment formula than the current roller coaster system based on timber receipts. The amount going toward schools and roads would represent 80-85 percent of the three-year average of the highest payment years from fiscal years 1986 to 1999. The amount would be calculated on a state-by-state, three-high-year basis, but would be distributed among the counties on a county-by-county,  three-high-year calculation. Unlike today's system, a county will receive its payment from the General Treasury, regardless of whether a single tree is cut on the national forests. 
   The bill before us today retains and improves upon a key element of S. 1608: that counties decide for themselves, in conjunction with other stakeholders, how they want to invest the remaining 15-to-20 percent of the average payment. This bill clarifies and underscores county flexibility to use the funds other than those designated for schools and roads in any combination a county chooses for: fire prevention and fighting wildfires; forest-related education; easement purchases; emergency services reimbursement; stewardship projects; maintenance of existing forest infrastructure; ecosystem restoration; and improvement of land and water quality on national forest lands. 
   There is no doubt about it. This legislation will change the traditional dynamic between logging and Federal payments to schools and counties. But altering the link between timber harvest and county payments does not mean we seek to sever the ties between people and land. This bill will strengthen the bond between communities and neighboring Federal forests. The authorized projects are a way for the Federal government to recognize--without relaxing or compromising our environmental commitments--that timber towns grow not just trees, but people, too.

   Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I come to the floor tonight to discuss the possibility that there will be an effort very shortly to override Oregon's assisted suicide law as part of a package that includes legislation that is extremely important to the country, such as legislation that would protect women from domestic violence, such as legislation that would also deal with sex trafficking--an extraordinary scourge that victimizes women and children. I think it would be extremely unfortunate to victimize the victims in that way. It is clearly not in the public interest. 
   Oregon's assisted suicide law involves a very controversial matter. I happen to be against assisted suicide, against the Oregon law, but the bill that cleared the Judiciary Committee on a 10-8 vote, a very narrow vote, is strongly opposed by the American Cancer Society. The American Cancer Society believes that legislation will harm those in pain. I am very hopeful that rather than tie this assisted suicide legislation to vitally needed legislation that would protect the victims of domestic violence and women and children from sex trafficking, the Senate would adhere to the agreement that was entered into in August. 
   In August, on a bipartisan basis, the Senate made it very clear, and I specifically addressed this on the floor of the Senate, that I was open to a fair fight, to an open debate on the assisted suicide question. In fact, I made it very clear that while I intend to use every opportunity to speak on the floor of the Senate and make sure the Members understand, for example, that the American Cancer Society believes this legislation will harm those in pain, I was willing to accept the 
   will of the Senate on any cloture vote that might be scheduled. That was the agreement entered into in August. It provided for a fair fight on this issue. 
   Tonight we are told that there may be the possibility, as I have touched on, of an effort to override Oregon's assisted suicide law. By the way, Oregon is the only State in the country that has such legislation. It would be linked to the other desperately needed measures, such as the legislation to protect women victimized by domestic violence. I hope that will not be the case. I would have to oppose very strongly that kind of effort. It seems to me it is not in the public interest, and it is particularly regrettable since it runs contrary to the spirit of what was agreed to in August: That there would be an opportunity for both sides on the floor of the Senate to have this debate about assisted suicide; I would have a chance to address the issue in some detail, but if there were an effort to file cloture, I would accept the will of the Senate on that measure. 
   In addition, we just learned in the last few minutes there is a possibility schoolchildren in 700 rural school districts around the country could also be held hostage because, again, there may be an objection to the county payments bill legislation authored by Senator CRAIG of Idaho and myself--again, bipartisan. There may be an objection to that bill, again, on the grounds that somehow it should be examined some more and possibly linked again to the assisted suicide question. 
   I think, again, these issues ought to be considered on the merits. The county payments legislation passed this body by unanimous consent; 100 Senators agreed to make sure that these schoolchildren in 700 rural school districts got a fair shake. We have been working with the House. We have now come up with an agreement among the House, the Senate, and the White House. I think we can pass it 100-0 in the Senate. But we are told someone is going to object to the county payments legislation for the unrelated reason that they are not able to work out an arrangement that allows them to throw the Oregon assisted suicide law in the trash can on an arbitrary basis. 
   What the Senate worked out in August was fair to all sides. It ensured that we have a chance to discuss the matter of assisted suicide. It is a controversial question. I personally am  against assisted suicide. I voted against the Oregon law twice. I voted against Federal funding for assisted suicide. But I oppose the legislation being advanced here to overturn Oregon's law for the same reasons that the American Cancer Society does. It will hurt patients in pain. 
   I felt compelled to come to the floor of the Senate and express my concern. I think it is not in the public interest to link desperately needed legislation such as the bill to protect the victims of domestic violence to the assisted suicide law. It is not appropriate to hold hostage the victims of sex trafficking to the Oregon assisted suicide law. I hope we will not see what has been raised as a possibility in the last few minutes, and that is to hold up the county payments legislation--which has been agreed to by the House and the Senate negotiators and those at the White House--that would provide a lifeline to 700 rural school districts all across the country. 
   I hope that bill and the other vitally needed legislation will not be held up because a Senator decides he or she wants to throw the assisted suicide override into unrelated legislation that this country needs so greatly. I made it clear last August I was open to being fair to both sides. That is why we entered into an agreement for a fair fight. I said I would respect the will of the Senate on a cloture vote if it came to that. I think we ought to adhere to that August agreement and not link this matter of throwing Oregon's law into the trash can by tucking it into unrelated legislation. 
   Frankly, those who are trying to tuck this override of Oregon's assisted suicide law into other legislation--such as the bill that would protect the victims of domestic violence--are doing a tremendous disservice to the women victimized by domestic violence, to the victims of sex trafficking, to the schoolchildren who desperately need that county payments legislation. These bills ought to be considered on their merits. That was agreed to back in August with respect to the assisted suicide legislation. I will do everything in my power to insist the Senate adhere to what was agreed on last August. 
   I thank my colleague and friend from Illinois for his thoughtfulness.

   Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, today I am pleased to introduce, with my friend and colleague from Oregon, Senator GORDON SMITH, the Fort Clatsop National Memorial Expansion Act of 2000. I am also pleased that Congressman DAVID WU, representing Fort Clatsop and Clatsop County in the United States House of Representatives, is introducing companion legislation in the House. 
   The Fort Clatsop Memorial marks the spot where Meriwether Lewis, William Clark and the Corps of Discovery spent 106 days during the winter of 1805. The bicentennial of their historic journey is fast approaching and it is estimated that over a quarter-million people will visit the Memorial during the bicentennial years of 2003 through 2006. Despite this anticipated influx of visitors, the Memorial is still legally limited to no more than 130 acres. This legislation would authorize the boundary expansion of the Memorial to no more than 1500 acres so as to help accommodate the large number of expected visitors. 
   Since the 1980s, the U.S. Park Service in Astoria, Oregon has been trying to negotiate a land purchase with Williamette Industries to acquire approximately 928 acres for the expansion of the Ft. Clatsop National Memorial. These acres are integral to the interpretation and enjoyment of the Memorial's historic site. Over the past 13 months the Park Service and Willamette Industries negotiated and, recently, reached an agreement that will lead to the Park Service acquiring this property. Before that can happen, however, this legislation, authorizing the expansion of the park boundary, will allow the Park Service to acquire the Willamette land administratively. The bill also authorizes a study of the national significance of Station Camp, another Lewis and Clark stopping point in 1805, located in Washington State. 
   The Park Service has targeted the expansion of the Fort Clatsop Memorial as one of its highest priorities. The Clatsop County Commission supports this legislation, as do the local landowners in and around the Memorial. In addition, I have heard from the National Parks and Conservation Association [NPCA], the Trust for Public Lands and the Conservation Fund, all of whom support efforts to expand the Ft. Clatsop Memorial.

   Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, today I join my friend from Oregon, Senator SMITH, in the introduction of the Steens Mountain Wilderness Act of 2000. Located in southeastern Oregon, Steens Mountain is, in the words of Oregon environmentalist, Andy Kerr, ``an ecological island in the sky.'' Rising a mile above the desert floor, Steens Mountain actually creates its own weather patterns. Though we from Oregon are blessed to have it located  within our state boundary, it is truly a National natural treasure. 
   Some have wondered why any legislative action at all is needed to protect the Steens. They say the Steens has been there a long time and is doing just fine. Why not just leave it alone? 
   There are three reasons why inaction at this time is an unacceptable choice. 
   First, there are many landowners today in the Steens with a commitment to protect this ecological treasure. There is no assurance that this will always be the case. 
   Second, our federal land agencies are now committed to protecting the natural ecology of the Steens. There is no assurance that this will always be the case. 
   Third, the Steens includes many wilderness study areas. We now have the opportunity to begin resolving the status of these lands that have been in limbo for twenty years. There is no assurance that Oregon's future elected officials, working with all concerned parties, will ever again have such a unique opportunity to address this contentious issue. 
   The fact of the matter is that protecting the ecological health of the Steens isn't going to happen by osmosis. It has taken the hard work of the Oregon Congressional delegation, Governor Kitzhaber, Secretary Babbitt and numerous staff and private citizens of Oregon to get this legislation where it is today. It will take a bit more hard work to get a Senate-passed bill. 
   It is my task, as a United States Senator, to move this legislation forward through the committee hearing and Senate floor processes. In that context, this bill will most likely have to be fine-tuned to accommodate additional concerns. I look forward to working with all my colleagues to see that this bill is passed before the lights go down on the 106th Congress. But one major aspect of this bill can never change: the protections for the ecological treasure that is the Steens will be put in place while we also preserve the important historical ranching culture that thrives there. 
   There have been issues raised about the valuation of the land exchanges that make the adoption of over 170,000 acres of wilderness possible in this bill. Let me make it perfectly clear that this bill should stand or fall on whether there is significant public value at the end of the day. I believe the Senate will find that the expenditures authorized by this legislation purchase the sum of a greater public value than can be accounted for by its individual parts. I will continue to work to assure that this legislation achieves the greatest environmental good possible.

   Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, many folks in rural Oregon and other parts of rural America believe the Federal Government has abandoned them. They think Washington, D.C. has reneged on a decades-long commitment to support their schools and roads with revenue from timber harvested on Federal lands. People in timber-dependent rural America think they are being left behind to live in economic sacrifice zones. 
   Policy changes in Washington, DC., affecting logging on national forest across this country have caused timber receipts to fall an average of 70 percent over the last 15 years, and by as much as 90 percent in some areas. As timber receipts disappeared, roads fell deeper into disrepair, school programs were cut to the bone, and some schools even had to close their doors at least 1 day a week. Our fellow citizens who live in rural America should not be just an afterthought in our warp-speed world. The legislation before us, the Secure Rural Schools and Community Self-Determination Act, will renew the compact with timber-dependent communities without compromising our commitment to environmentally sound stewardship of our forests. It will give people in rural counties the financial predictability they need to step into the 21st century. 
   Since 1908, people in rural counties across this country have lived by a compact with the Federal Government. As compensation for paying no property taxes, the Federal Government would give the counties a quarter of the timber revenue. For decades, this arrangement provide adequate funds to sustain schools, roads and other basic county services, like emergency rescue. But when timber harvests began to drop off and timber jobs were lost, little effort was made to help offset the shortfall, and citizens in rural counties felt betrayed by the government in Washington, DC. We are not talking  about a few isolated communities in remote areas of America. Timber-dependent communities are found in 709 counties in 42 states. Some 800,000 school children and millions of people live in these counties. Thirty-one of 36 counties in my State of Oregon receive timber payments. Counties in the western part of Oregon have been able to survive because of Spotted Owl safety net payments, but no such safety net exists for those in eastern Oregon. There, Grant County, has lost 90 percent of its timber receipts, from more than $12 million down to $1 million, and the county has turned to such cost-cutting measures as a 4-day school week. 
   Under this legislation, Oregon counties will get a total of $261 million a year--an increase of $115 million, or 79 percent. Of the $261 million, $222 million would be available for schools and roads and $39 million will remain for the counties either to invest in their backyard national forests or in forest-related county services. 
   The purpose of S. 1608 is to help rural communities adapt to changing national forest management policies by creating a funding formula alternative to timber receipts. The legislation will ensure that the future relationship between the people living in the 709 affected rural counties and the Federal Government does not depend on how many trees are cut. Rural communities will be connected to Federal lands through stewardship projects, maintenance of existing forest infrastructure, ecosystem restoration and improvement of land and water quality. Counties will choose how to spend the Federal payment, and projects will be developed by broad-based groups of local citizens. Collaboration with Federal land managers will help ensure projects comply with all existing environmental laws and regulations. The legislation would restore stability to the 25 percent payments compact by ensuring a predictable payment level to forest communities for six years. The amount going toward schools and roads would represent 80-85 percent of the three-year average of the highest payment years from 1985 to the present. Unlike today's system, a county will receive its payment from the general Treasury, regardless of whether a single tree is cut from national forests. 
   Counties will decide for themselves how to invest the remaining 15-to-20 percent of the average amount described above for projects recommended by local community advisory committees if those projects are approved by the appropriate Federal land management agency. Although locally-conceived, every project must comply with all environmental laws and regulations, as well as all applicable forest plans. Counties might also opt to pursue projects related to the forest--rather than in the forest--through Title III. These projects might include fire prevention, the purchase of easements or forest-related after-school programs. In addition, each project must--and I quote from the bill here--``improve the maintenance of existing infrastructure, implement stewardship objectives that enhance forest ecosystems, and restore and improve land health and water quality'' on the national forests. 
   County choice is critical to the bill. Counties that opt not to join the program--such as those anticipating higher timber receipts in the immediate future--will continue to receive payments based on the existing formula, and they also have the option of joining the program two years down the road. Counties that opt to join the program will get stable payments based on a new formula. 
   There is no doubt about it. This legislation will change the traditional dynamic between logging and Federal payments to schools and counties. But altering the link between timber harvest and county payments does not mean we seek to sever the ties between people and land. S. 1608 will strengthen the bond between communities and neighboring Federal forests. The projects that would be authorized by S. 1608 are a way for the Federal government to recognize--without relaxing or compromising our environmental commitments--that timber towns grow not just trees, but people, too. 
   When this debate began, the issues were highly polarized. On the one side were those who would punish the Forest Service for not cutting enough trees; on the other were those who, unintentionally, would punish our rural communities and school children by not providing them the funding they so desperately need. After listening to both sides and after many long discussions, Senator CRAIG and I rejected the extremes and sought out a middle path that would break the gridlock. The legislation we bring to the Senate will establish a foundation to move rural communities beyond this time of crisis, and, with the forest ecosystem restoration projects, put them on a path toward sustainability in this new century. 
   One of my goals for this legislation was to assure the counties have as much choice as possible, and I believe this goal has been met. As I said earlier, first, counties can choose whether they would like to be part of this program and receive a stable payment. If they choose not to be part of the program, they may revisit this decision every 2 years. Second, a county that chooses to be part of the program and receive stable payments must decide the type of projects they want to invest in: projects in the forest, like stream and watershed restoration; or projects related to the forests, such as wildfire prevention or afterschool programs for their children. Also, a county can opt simply to have the money sent back to the U.S. Treasury without pursuing projects. Finally, these choices may be revisited every year. 
   The ecological health of the forests is a key to survival for many of these communities, making forest restoration a cornerstone of the bill. Counties have choices as to how and how much they receive so they are able to determine the best allocation of funds: whether to support forest health, job creation, ecosystem restoration or a combination of these. Whatever the choice, it is an investment in both the future of the forest and the community. This legislation is the product of many months of painstaking work. Since the beginning, it has been a bipartisan effort. The Energy and Natural Resources Committee reported the legislation by voice vote last April, and through negotiations with many other interested Senators, we have a managers' amendment that represents a further refinement of the bill. 
   I particularly want to thank Senators CRAIG  and BINGAMAN,  the Chair and ranking member of the Energy Committee. Without their dedication and willingness to put long hours into this effort, we would not have such a solid piece of legislation. I would also like to make special note of the help of Senator BAUCUS in crafting Title III and bringing a strong focus on wildfire prevention. I would also like to acknowledge the work of the staff on S. 1608. In particular, Jose Kardon, my chief of staff, and Sarah Bittleman, my Natural Resources counsel, have done yeoman's work on this legislation. Carole Grunberg, my legislative director, and Jeff Gagne, my Education advisor, also contributed to the effort. Special thanks also goes to Mark Rey of the Energy Committee staff, whose steady hand and creativity helped resolve so many problems successfully; to Bob Simon and Kira Finkler, of the Energy Committee Democratic staff; and to Brian Kuehl with Senator BAUCUS and Sara Barth with Senator BOXER.

   Mr. WYDEN. Yes, that is the correct interpretation of the bill's language and intent. The purpose of S. 1608 is to increase both county funding and county choice. Unlike projects under title II, the role of the Resource Advisory Committees is much more limited under title III and is limited to an advisory role.

   Mr. WYDEN. That is correct. It is my intent that a Resource Advisory Committee would review projects in as expeditious a manner as possible, but that in any event, the failure of a Resource Advisory Committee to review a project in a timely manner would not under this bill be grounds for denying a county the ability to move forward with it.

   Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I will be very brief. I thank my colleagues, particularly Chairman CRAIG, Senator GORDON SMITH, who was so extraordinarily helpful, Senator BINGAMAN, Senator BAUCUS, Senator BOXER, and many of our colleagues who put in a great many hours on this legislation. 
   Frankly, 18 months ago, they said it could not be done. This legislation 18 months ago was an ideological magnet for those who wanted to debate natural resources policy. Senator CRAIG and I said this legislation, which funds basic services in rural America for schools, roads, and other essential services, was beyond that kind of discussion. It was too important to try to settle all of the divisive issues about natural resources on this legislation. 
   I am very pleased this bipartisan legislation has been passed because this legislation sends a strong message that it is not right for Federal policies to turn rural communities into economic sacrifice zones. I believe this reinvents the relationship between local communities and the Federal lands that are so important to them. It will ensure that we can provide for the economic livelihood of folks in rural communities, but also it ensures that in the future we are going to focus on watershed restoration and conservation easements and a wide variety of measures that are going to protect ecosystems. 
   I thank my colleague who is on the floor, Chairman CRAIG. As I said, 18 months ago no one would have thought that we could be here tonight with this extraordinarily important legislation for rural America. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, today, I am introducing groundbreaking legislation to make a difference in the way in which dying patients and their families can access hospice care. Ninety percent of Americans do not realize that there is a hospice benefit provided under the Medicare program. Over time, the length of stay in a hospice is decreasing so that patients do not get the full benefit of services that could make them more comfortable at a crucial time in their lives. 
   The issues related to how we die are too important to permit the Medicare Hospice benefit to remain fixed in time. Now is the time to begin to test new ways to design the benefit so that the benefit can remain truly patient-centered at one of the most crucial times in patients' and their families' lives. 
   Just as we push our health care system for medical breakthroughs that will allow more of us to live healthier and longer, we need to drive our health care system to create accessible, positive care for those facing the end of life. 
   My legislation, the Hospice Improvement Act of 2000, would require the Secretary to establish a demonstration program to increase access and use of hospice care for patients at the end-of-life, and to increase the knowledge of hospice among the medical, mental health and patient communities. My legislation stresses the following: 
   Supportive and Comfort Care: To assist families and patients in getting the benefit of hospice care, the Demonstration program will allow for a new supportive and comfort care benefit. This benefit, elected at the option of the patient, will not require the terminally ill to elect hospice care instead of other medical treatment, but will permit a patient to have supportive and comfort care in place while the patient still seeks ``curative treatment.'' This will permit patients and families to learn about hospice without forcing them to make a choice between hospice and other care. Case management would be provided through a hospice provider reimbursed on a fee-for-service basis. 
   Severity Index Instead of a Six-Month Prognosis: To determine whether or not a patient is eligible for the supportive and comfort care option, a severity index will be used instead of the current hospice requirement of a 6 month prognosis. This will permit patients to have access to support services, as needed, instead of relying on an often inaccurate time-related prognosis. 
   Increase Rural Hospice Access: Permit nurse practitioners and physician assistants to admit patients to hospice if this is within their authority under state practice law. In communities without a qualified social worker, other professionals with skills, knowledge and ability may provide medical social services such as counseling on the effects of illness on the family. 
   Respite Care: Nursing facilities used for respite care would not be required to have skilled nurses on the premises 24 hours a day (because hospice will be caring for the patient) or respite could be provided in the patient's home. 
   Payment Issues: Permit reimbursement for consultations, preadmission informational visits, even if the patient does not elect hospice/supportive care and provide minimum payment for Medicare hospice services provided under the demonstration program based on the provision of services for a period of 14 days, regardless of length of stay. 
   In addition, the demonstration project could address other payment issues such as offsetting changes in services and oversight and the increased cost of providing services in rural areas and creating a per diem rate of payment for respite care that reflects the range of care needs. 
   In addition to the Demonstration program, the Secretary would be required to establish an education grant program for the purpose of providing information about the Medicare hospice benefit, and the benefits available under the demonstration program. Education grants could be used to provide individual or group education to patients and their families and to the medical and mental health community, and to test messages to improve public  knowledge about the Medicare hospice benefit. 
   Let me conclude by saying that in the time left for this Congress, we have a unique opportunity to truly begin to improve care for the dying. There are fewer who are more vulnerable than someone who is dying and having to cope with the physical breakdown of their body and the emotional turmoil that imminent death brings to a family. This legislation provides us an opportunity to begin to remove the barriers to care for those who facing death.

    Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I wish today to draw the Senate's attention to National Assisted Living Week. The National Center for Assisted Living is sponsoring National Assisted Living Week this week to highlight the significance and the hope that this type of service can provide seniors. 
   Assisted living is a long term care alternative for seniors who need more assistance than is available in retirement communities, but do not require the heavy medical and nursing care provided by nursing facilities. Approximately one million of our nation's seniors have chosen the option of assisted living in this country. This demonstrates a tremendous desire by seniors and their families to have the kind of assistance that they need in bathing, taking medications or other activities of daily living in a setting that truly becomes their home. 
   This year's theme of National Assisted Living Week is ``The Art of Life'' and it is intended as recognition of the value of creative expression. I think that it is appropriate because it shows that assisted living is a real option for seniors to continue experiencing ``the art of life'' in living arrangements tailored to meet their needs for socialization, independence and services. 
   Oregon has led our nation in the concept of assisted living. My state spends more state health dollars to provide assisted living services than any other in our nation. Assisted living has taken different directions in different states, and I believe offering these choices for consumers is important to provide security, dignity and independence for seniors. 
   Assisted living will become even more important as an option of seniors and their families as our nation experiences the demographic tsunami of aging baby boomers. It is important for us to continue to support options that allow seniors and their families a choice of settings in order to assure that they get the level of care that they need.

   Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I wish to explain to my colleagues the reasons for my objection to a unanimous consent request for the Senate to adopt legislation to make the Visa Waiver Pilot Program permanent, H.R. 3767. I do so consistent with the commitment I have made to explain publicly any so-called ``holds'' that I may place on legislation. 
   I regret that I am compelled to object to this measure at this point but I do so for reasons similar to those given previously. I believe the Senate should not allow the security of millions of rural Americans to be ignored while we press ahead with legislation to take care of immigration matters. 
   Since April, a prominent Senate Republican leader has had a de facto hold on a bipartisan bill of critical importance to the security of those who live in rural counties, S. 1608, The Secure Rural Schools and Community Self-Determination Act of 2000. But time is running out. It is the end of July; there are fewer than 26 legislative days left. People in rural counties across America who have strained under dwindling Federal resource funds need this legislation. They should not be made to wait.

   Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I am pleased today to introduce the Capital Construction Fund Reform Act of 2000. 
   The Capital Construction Fund (CCF) was originally created by the Merchant Marine Act as a way to encourage the construction and use of American-owned vessels in U.S. waters. For fishermen, the Capital Construction Fund authorizes the accumulation of funds, free from taxes, for the purpose of buying or refitting commercial fishing vessels. The program has been a success in promoting the domestic fishing industry. However, the usefulness of the CCF has not kept up with the times. Today it is actually exacerbating the problems facing U.S. fisheries by forcing fishermen to keep their money in fishing vessels, rather than allowing them to retire from fishing and pursue other interests. 
   Our nation's fisheries are collapsing. Over the past year, fisheries in New England, Alaska and the West Coast have been officially declared disasters by the Secretary of Commerce. Plainly speaking, there are too many boats and not enough fish. Along the West Coast, a mere 200 of the 1400 boats currently fishing could catch the entire allowable harvest of groundfish. That means we could buyout 85 percent of the boats and still not reduce capacity in our fisheries. Since 1995, Congress has appropriated $140 million to buy fishing vessels and permits back from fishermen. Clearly, more needs to be done. This legislation empowers the fisherman to make his own choices to stay or leave the fishery with his own money. 
   In these times when we ought to be reducing the number of boats in our fisheries, it does not make sense for federal policy to encourage fishermen to build more of them. Yet current law prohibits fishermen from getting their own money out of CCF accounts for any purpose other than building boats. If they do, they lose up to 70 percent of their money in taxes and penalties. When fishermen have already been hit with increasingly severe harvest restrictions over the past few years, it is just not fair to hold their own money hostage. 
   That is why I'm introducing a bill that makes it easier for fishermen to withdraw their funds from the Capital Construction Fund if they retire from the fishery. My bill would allow fund holders to roll their funds over into an Individual Retirement Account (IRA) or other retirement fund. It would also allow them to use their own money to participate in buyback programs. This bill also eliminates the tax-penalty for withdrawals for those folks wishing to leave the industry. 
   Mr. President, this bill enjoys wide support from a variety of organizations with an interest in our nation's fisheries. Environmental groups, trawlers, small boat operators and processors alike have expressed their enthusiasm for this legislation. I urge my colleagues to support the swift adoption of this bill so that our fisherman can start making their own choices about their businesses and lives.

   Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, approximately 3.4 million students entered kindergarten in U.S. public schools last  fall, and experts predict wildly different futures for them. Many children do well throughout elementary school, only to slip and fall between the cracks in middle school. This so-called ``achievement gap'' opens wide in middle school and grows throughout high school if nothing is done to stop it. 
   Raising test scores in K-12 education has brought the achievement-gap issue to the forefront of the national education debate and created a new opportunity to support those states that are making a real effort to improve student achievement. But trying to close the gap by simply bumping up test standards only pushes kids out of school rather than across the gap. 
   Few have really looked at the most logical place to begin to close the gap: summer school. Students take their achievement tests in April but have to return to school in the Fall. Summer school is one place to begin helping students close the gap, yet the Federal government does nothing to create and support successful summer academic programs. 
   The legislation I am introducing today, the Student Education Enrichment Development Act, or SEED Act, will leverage summer academic programs to boost student performance. SEED will support all struggling students by providing the first federal funds to backstop state and local efforts to develop, plan, implement, and operate high quality summer academic enrichment programs. 
   The disparity in school performance tied to race and ethnicity, known as the achievement gap, shows up in grades, test scores, course selection, and college completion. To a large extent, these factors predict a student's success in school, whether a student will go to college, and how much money the student will earn when he or she enters the working world. It happens in cities and in suburbs and in rural school districts. The gaps are so pronounced that in 1996, several national tests found African-American and Hispanic 12th graders scoring at roughly the same levels in reading and math as white 8th graders. By 2019, when they are 24 years old, current trends indicate that the white children who are now nearing the end of their first year in school will be twice as likely as their African-American classmates, and three times as likely as Hispanics, to have a college degree. 
   In Oregon last year, only 52 percent of the tenth graders met the state's standard for reading, while only 36 percent met the standard for math. But students in Oregon are actually doing better than the national average. More than two-thirds of American high-school seniors graduated last year without being able to read at a proficient level. Results like these are the reason we need SEED.

   Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, it has been more than a year since the Columbine tragedy, but still this Republican Congress refuses to act on sensible gun legislation. 
   Since Columbine, thousands of Americans have been killed by gunfire. Until we act, Democrats in the Senate will read some of the names of those who lost their lives to gun violence in the past year, and we will continue to do so every day that the Senate is in session. 
   In the name of those who died, we will continue this fight. Following are the names of some of the people who were killed by gunfire one year ago today. 
   July 26: 
   Frederick Branch, 17, Memphis, TN; Kenny Curry, 30, Chicago, IL; Mendell Jones, 17, Baltimore, MD; Eduardo Lezcano, 36, Miami-Dade County, FL; Andre Moore, 21, Baltimore, MD; Kenneth Plaster, 52, Houston, TX; Mark Pringle, 18, Baltimore, MD; Carlton Valentine, 33, Baltimore, MD; Unidentified male, Detroit, MI. 
   We cannot sit back and allow such senseless gun violence to continue. The deaths of these people are a reminder to all of us that we need to enact sensible gun legislation now.

   Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, before he leaves the floor, I thank the chairman of the Budget Committee for the opportunity to be involved in this issue. I think the chairman has said it very well. In effect, what he has done is make the case for why the bill we are proposing is absolutely essential to modernize the Medicare program. 
   If there is one principle that Medicare is going to have to stand for in the 21st century, it is that we must change this system which now literally rewards waste and penalizes frugality. 
   Medicare has an HMO reimbursement system today which is, even by beltway standards, perverse. It sends the message if you are really inefficient, if you have not taken the steps that Colorado and Oregon and other States have taken, don't worry about it, don't go out and make the tough choices about introducing competition to your community. The Federal Government will just keep sending you big checks. 
   I think it is absolutely key, especially given the fact that close to a million seniors are going to lose their HMO coverage this year--close to a million seniors will lose their coverage this year--that we pass this bipartisan legislation. I think the chairman is right. I think by the end of the next couple of days, we will have many other colleagues from both political parties here. I see my friend, Senator SMITH of Oregon, has come into the Chamber. He and I have worked on this issue since he has come to the Senate as part of our bipartisan agenda for Oregon. I am going to talk for a few minutes to try to elaborate on some of the themes Chairman DOMENICI has so eloquently addressed. 
   As we have seen in Oregon and New Mexico and so many other States, the present HMO reimbursement system is literally driving HMO plans out of the program and leaving seniors across this country petrified about their future health care in their communities. What senior after senior asks at this point is how can it be that since they pay the same amount for hospitalization and outpatient services, if they live in Pendleton or they live in Portland, they pay the same amount for outpatient and hospitalization services as seniors in other parts of the country yet the Federal Government does not send an equal payment to folks in Pendleton and Portland? As Chairman DOMENICI has very specifically and eloquently described, they send dramatically different payments to communities across this country. So you can have communities, for example, on the east coast, that literally get twice the reimbursement of communities in Oregon and New Mexico. 
   We hear about it very bluntly from our constituents. You can have a senior in Pendleton or Coos Bay call up their cousin in one of the cities back East and ask their cousin about Medicare, how it is going. 
   The senior back East says: You know, it goes great. I get prescription drugs for only a few dollars a month. I also get dental coverage. I get free hearing aids. How is it going for you there in Coos Bay or Pendleton or Albuquerque, NM? How is Medicare going for you? 
   That senior in Albuquerque or Pendleton or Portland wants to throw the telephone through the living room window because they don't get that prescription drug coverage, hearing aids, or dental coverage because the reimbursement is as low as Chairman DOMENICI has described. 
   The Congress was supposed to have begun, several years ago, 
   a bipartisan effort to change this. The system was called a blended rate. In effect, over the next few years, we would move to a national system, so instead of driving some of these high-cost areas down precipitously, we would move low-cost areas up over the next few years. Unfortunately, that system has been delayed. It has been delayed, in my view, in a fashion that has made for many plans saying they can no longer afford to stay in business; certainly no longer afford to offer some of those benefits such as prescription drugs, which are so important to seniors. 
   That is why Chairman DOMENICI and I and Senator GRASSLEY and Senator KERREY and I know many of our colleagues are going to join in a bipartisan effort, first, to establish a minimum payment floor for urban counties; second, to boost the rural counties where, again, these programs have barely been able to survive as a result of low reimbursement rates; and, third, to address the concerns with respect to wages that Senator GRASSLEY has so eloquently described. But I am of the view that if this Congress is to modernize the Medicare program, the essence of such a modernization effort is to create more options and more choices. That will not be possible if you perpetuate an HMO reimbursement system that day after day after day penalizes frugality and rewards waste. 
   For those who really want to get into the details of this subject, the system is known as the AAPCC, the average adjusted per capita cost. The way it has worked, the HMOs are reimbursed by the Federal Government through a system that historically has looked at average local costs of various procedures, such as a heart bypass in Pendleton or cataract operation in Portland--and then you calculate a formula for reimbursing these HMOs, using a percentage of the fee-for-service costs for health care in the area. 
   But at the end of the day, the message is, if you are wasteful, don't worry about it. If you are inefficient, the Federal Government is going to say maybe that is not ideal, but we will just send you a check to reflect the fact that you are not taking steps to hold down your costs and we are not going to give you any consequences as a result. 
   That makes no sense to Senator DOMENICI and me and our cosponsors. I know it makes no sense to the Presiding Officer because he and I have talked about this innumerable times. We tried to boost reimbursement rates for the people of Oregon. We have to change the Medicare program to eliminate the discrimination against communities that control costs while offering good quality care. 
   Our bipartisan legislation is not just a one-time infusion of money. We structured it so that money becomes part of a base for future increases, which in my view helps to jump-start what Congress intended several years ago by passing legislation to promote a nationwide blended rate. 
   We all understand that at present, as we look to the last days of the session, with the budget surplus, it is going to be possible to use a portion of that surplus, after we have helped pay down the debt, after hopefully there is a targeted tax cut; at that point, we will have some dollars to take the steps to better meet the health care needs of older people and also jump start the modernization of the Medicare program. 
   Our legislation, I hope, will be part of that effort. I think Chairman DOMENICI and Senator GRASSLEY, among our cosponsors, are very likely to be in the room at the end of the day when that legislation is being offered. I and others are going to do our best to support those efforts in the Budget Committee. I know the Presiding Officer and I have used every opportunity to raise these issues, and we are going to continue to do so. 
   Our State has been a pioneer in the health care reform area. We are proud of the fact that we are the first State in the country to have made tough choices about health care priorities through the Oregon health plan. We are proud of the fact that we have been able to introduce more choices and more competition to the health care system and, as a result, seniors in our State are able to get more for their health care dollar.  
   It is not right for older people in Oregon, New Mexico, Iowa, and in other States where they have done the heavy lifting and they have taken steps to hold down their costs, to be discriminated against by the Federal Government. 
   This bipartisan legislation, in my view, is going to help keep HMOs that are currently in the program in the program, and it will begin the process of bringing back to Medicare some of those we have lost because they have been discriminated against in the past with respect to reimbursement and they could not keep their doors open. 
   We will be talking about this legislation frequently in the last few days of this Congress and in the fall, and I believe passing this legislation, as we look at that final budget bill that is sure to be part of our fall debates, that this is one of the best ways we can target dollars that need to be spent carefully so as to maximize the values of what we are getting in health care for older people. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I thank Senator COCHRAN and Senator KOHL for accepting this important amendment to S. 2536, the Agriculture appropriations bill for fiscal year 2001. 
   According to the USDA, Oregon ranks first in hunger and seventh in food insecurity in the nation. This amendment will fund, at $176,000, a demonstration project pairing technology and teamwork: The Food Electronically and Effectively Distributed FEED Website Demonstration Project. 
   As the only state in the nation with a statewide food bank system in place, the Oregon Food Bank, as well as an organized and active agricultural community, Oregon is prepared to develop and use the FEED website to provide a national model for other states interested in pursuing an organized statewide anti-hunger campaign. 
   Developed and used in conjunction with Oregon food producers, processors, distributors, transporters, and anti-hunger agents, as well as the UDA and state agriculture extension agents the FEED website will transform the current anti-hunger food distribution network by using the power of Internet technology to support and facilitate real-time communication links between those with food, those who need food and those who can transport food. 
   The FEED website will also provide a forum for sharing information about innovative anti-hunger efforts, both legislative and organizational, as well as links to other existing government, non-profit, and anti-hunger web sites to increase information sharing between active organizations and people in need.

    Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I am introducing today legislation that will allow the Bureau of Reclamation to conduct a feasibility study on ways to improve water management in the Malheur, Owyhee, Powder and Burnt River basins in northeastern Oregon. An earlier study by the Bureau identified a number of problems on these four Snake River tributaries, including high water temperatures and degraded fish habitat. 
   These types of problems are not unique to these rivers; in fact, many rivers in the Pacific Northwest are in a similar condition. However, Oregon has a unique approach to solving these problems through the work of Watershed Councils. In these Councils, local farmers, ranchers and other stakeholders sit down together with the resource agencies to develop action plans to solve local problems. 
   The Council members have the local knowledge of the land and waters, but they don't have technical expertise. The Bureau of Reclamation has the expertise to collect the kinds of water flow and water quality data that are needed to understand how the watershed works and how effective different solutions might be. 
   One class of possible solutions includes small-scale construction projects, such as upgrading of irrigation systems and creation of wetlands to act as pollutant filters. This legislation would allow the Bureau of Reclamation to partner with the Watershed Councils in determining how such small-scale construction projects might benefit both the environment and the local economy. 
   This bill authorizes a study; it does not authorize actual construction. It simply enables the Bureau to help find the most logical solution to resource management issues.  
   I look forward to a hearing on this bill in the Energy and Natural Resources Subcommittee on Water and Power. I welcome my colleague, Mr. SMITH, as an original co-sponsor of this bill.

   Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, for some time now the Senate has been debating, somewhat interchangeably, two issues; one involves protection for roadless areas and the other involves the important issue of fire prevention. 
   I would like to take just a minute or 2 to discuss each one of these so that it is clear where we are with respect to this debate. 
   The original amendment offered by the senior Senator from Idaho, Mr. CRAIG, my longtime colleague on the Forestry Subcommittee, would have, in effect, presented the Senate with a referendum on the President's roadless proposal, a major environmental initiative, certainly supported by millions of Americans. There have been more than 180 public meetings on this roadless initiative, and more than 500,000 comments. This is certainly the centerpiece of the President's environmental agenda. 
   So had we been presented here in the Senate with an up-or-down vote on this roadless proposal, despite my friendship with the Senator from Idaho, I would have had to oppose that original amendment strongly. To me, the President's proposal on roadless areas makes sense for one reason: Protecting additional unspoiled areas can produce gains for fish runs across this country, as well as improving habitat and watershed quality. These environmental gains outweigh the benefits of commercial development on these particular lands. 
   A lawsuit is pending in Federal court concerning the FACA issue as related to the roadless initiative. Certainly Congress should allow the judicial process to operate without interference. 
   Several of my colleagues have noted that oral arguments are going to be heard on August 7 in that lawsuit. There will be plenty of time for the Senate to act with respect to any issues involving the Federal Advisory Committee. But I say, as the ranking Democrat on the Forestry Subcommittee, I think it would be a great mistake for the Senate to, in effect, ashcan the President's roadless area proposal. Fortunately, the Senate is not going to be asked to vote up or down on that issue today. 
   I have, for some time, along with a number of other colleagues, pursued an effort to modernize our policy with respect to both road and roadless areas. There is much that we can do that protects both habitat and also resource-dependent communities. But to have had a referendum on the President's roadless area proposal today, with a lawsuit pending, and with millions of Americans in support of that proposal, would have been, in my view, a very serious mistake. 
   Now we are presented with a substitute proposal, initiated by the two Senators from New Mexico, involving fire prevention. At this point, we are talking about something very different than the original Craig proposal. We are talking about an effort to protect homes and businesses, and, by the way, habitat as well. 
   I want it understood for the record that this amendment is not going to affect the completion of the roadless area initiative. That is why I am pleased to be able to say that I intend to support this fire prevention initiative. Again, this new amendment does not affect the roadless area proposal. 
   With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, in October, 1999, I came to the Senate floor to speak about an important amendment to the Labor, Health and Human Services Appropriations Bill for Fiscal Year 2000 concerning farm workers. I have worked on this issue for over three years. I worked with my friend, Senator SMITH of Oregon, as well as my colleague Senator GRAHAM of Florida, to have our bipartisan amendment adopted by the managers of the bill, Senator SPECTER and Senator HARKIN. 
   I come to the floor today as the Senate completes debate on the Labor, Health and Human Services appropriations bill for fiscal year 2001 to again ask the administration to get serious about addressing the very real problems in the current farm worker system. 
   The amendment that was adopted into last year's Labor HHS appropriations bill required the Department of Labor to report to Congress with plans to improve compensation, working conditions, and other benefits for farm workers in the United States. The adopted amendment became report language in the Labor HHS Conference Report directing the Department of Labor to deliver the administration's farm worker plan to Congress as soon as possible. 
   It is almost ten months since that directive was adopted by the entire Congress--and almost three years since I was first promised by Secretary of Labor Herman that such a plan was being devised--and still the administration has delivered no plan. As we enter the busiest time of the year for American farms, once again I am  forced to point out the ineptitude of the Administration in dealing with this critical issue. 
   The General Accounting Office completed a report in 1997 on the farm worker situation in our country. They said there are enough farm workers. But they came to that conclusion only by counting illegal farm workers. 
   Today's agricultural labor program is a disaster for both farm workers and farmers. Estimates are that well over half of the farm workers in this country are here illegally. They are smuggled into the United States by people called ``coyotes.'' Because they are here illegally, these farm workers have no power--they cannot vote. The illegal, but much needed, farm worker is often subjected to the worst possible living and working conditions imaginable. This situation is nothing short of immoral. 
   At the same time, the growers, who need a dependable supply of workers to pick our crops, are also in a completely untenable situation. Senator SMITH and I represent Oregon farmers who literally have no where to turn to find legal farm workers. The current situation turns those farmers who want to do the right thing into people who have to make a Hobbesian choice: do they become felons by hiring illegal farm workers or do they go bankrupt. 
   It bears repeating: Well over half of the farm workers in the United States are illegal immigrants. 
   Oregon farmers have told me that in meetings, with the Immigration and Naturalization Service and the Department of Justice, the Administration has admitted that they know farmers must become felons by hiring illegal workers. It is deplorable that farmers are greeted by the Administration with winks and nods--not a legal farm worker system. 
   In 1998, in the second session of the 105th Congress, Senator GRAHAM, Senator SMITH, and I put together a bipartisan proposal to change this wholly unacceptable system. We tried to create a new system for dealing with agricultural labor that would be in the interest of both the farm worker and the farmer. Under our bill, workers who were legal would get a significant increase in their benefits and farmers would be assured a consistent, legal work force. 
   But after 67 Senators passed our bill, the administration refused to work with us to hammer out badly needed H2A reform legislation. 
   At that point, Senators GRAHAM, SMITH, and I started alternatively waiting for and asking for the Administration to produce their plan for a new agricultural worker system that would address the legitimate concerns of both farm workers and farmers. 
   In the spirit of comity and a desire to reach agreement with the executive branch, we have been waiting to see the Administration's plan. Mr. President, to date, after meetings, phone calls and congressional directives, we have been kept waiting for more than three years to see the administration's proposal. 
   By its inaction, the Administration is perpetuating a system that is a disaster for both the farm-worker and the farmer. It is a system that is totally broken--a system that has condemned the vast majority of farm workers to some of the most terrible and immoral conditions imaginable. It is a system that has made it impossible for farmers who want to do the right thing. 
   Our bipartisan effort was not a good enough solution for the administration. Well, the administration's inaction is not a good enough solution for me. 
   All of us--farm workers and growers, Senators GRAHAM, SMITH, and I--continue to wait. It is time for the administration to get off the sidelines. They should do what they promised to do well over two years ago and what we, as Congress, required them to do over 10 months ago.

   Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, very shortly I will be sending to the desk an amendment to deal with an issue of extraordinary importance; that is, the question of pharmaceuticals that get to the market to a great extent through taxpayer-funded research. 
   From the very beginning of this debate on prescription drugs, I teamed up with Senator OLYMPIA SNOWE of Maine on this issue. I believe this prescription drug issue is so extraordinarily important that it has to be pursued in a bipartisan fashion. 
   We have seen that there is an enormous interest in this country on the question of prescription drugs, and it has become a heated and contentious debate. In an effort to try to ensure this discussion was bipartisan at every level, in developing the amendment I will very shortly offer, I consulted at some length with the chairman of the subcommittee, Senator SPECTER of Pennsylvania, as well as Senator HARKIN, the ranking minority member. 
   Because he is on the floor, at this time I would especially like to thank Chairman SPECTER and his staff for all the efforts to work with us on this matter. Chairman SPECTER has been very gracious as well as his staff--I see Bettilou Taylor here--in making time to work with us on an amendment that I believe will be acceptable to both the majority and the minority when I send it to the desk. 
   In this discussion of the question of pharmaceuticals that get to market largely through taxpayer funds, I think it was said very clearly by Congressman BILL THOMAS, the chairman of the House Ways and Means Subcommittee on Health, and a member of the Republican leadership: ``When taxpayers' money is being spent, there ought to be a return on that investment.'' 
   I am going to repeat that because I think it says it very well. Congressman BILL THOMAS, chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee subcommittee said: ``When taxpayers' money is being spent, there ought to be a return on that investment.'' 
   I think what is critical at this point is that taxpayers and citizens of this country understand just how extensive the Federal investment in these pharmaceuticals is. 
   We all understand that the development of prescription medicine in this country is a risky business. You are going to have some successful investments. You also are going to have some dry holes. That is the nature of the free enterprise system. That is what entrepreneurship is all about. It is about risk taking, and it is about focusing on bright, creative ideas in the private marketplace. Particularly in the pharmaceutical sector, this approach has lead to nothing less than a revolution. So many of the medicines of today are central to keeping people well, and keeping folks healthy. They help to hold down blood pressure and cholesterol. As a result of those medicines, we end up very often seeing massive savings that would otherwise be incurred by what is called Part A of the Medicare program--the hospital portion of the program. 
   This exciting revolution in the pharmaceutical sector is one that we all appreciate. However, today we want to take special note of the fact that the taxpayers have contributed in a very significant way to that revolution. 
   According to the Joint Economic Committee, Federal research was instrumental in the development of 15 of the 21 drugs considered to have the highest therapeutic impact on society which were introduced between 1965 and 1992. Of those 15 pharmaceuticals, 7 have specific ties to the National Institutes of Health. Of those seven pharmaceuticals with direct connections to  the National Institutes of Health, three had more than $1 billion in sales in 1994, and in 1995. 
   Mr. President, I send my amendment to the desk.

   Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, this amendment is very specific in that it directs the National Institutes of Health to bring to the Senate by March 31, 2001, a specific proposal for ensuring that research funded by the taxpayer be recognized in the development of pharmaceuticals, and that the companies that benefit from that research pay reasonable rates of return on the investment by the taxpayer. 
   I believe it is fair to all parties--to entrepreneurs, to researchers, to those in the pharmaceutical sector--and to all sides because it recognizes that this is a difficult issue. 
   There are some technical questions with respect to how this is done. In particular, the nature of the pharmaceutical discovery is one that has to be thought through very carefully. But at the same time acceptance of this amendment would bring a sense of urgency to this issue. 
   The Congress has a long history on this question. But the fact is that for some years there has not been adequate recognition of the fact that the taxpayer has done much of the heavy lifting in getting these pharmaceuticals to market. 
   With this amendment we will ensure when the taxpayers play a significant role in a blockbuster drug that ends up producing very significant profits for an individual company that the taxpayers' investment will be recognized. 
   I am just going to take a few minutes on this matter and use an example with which I think we are familiar in the Congress but which has special ramifications for folks in my part of the United States, and that is the drug Taxol. 
   Before I do, I will ask unanimous consent to make a modest change, but a very important one, that also includes the Appropriations Committee.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I want to cite one example of a blockbuster drug that makes the case for why this amendment is so important. That drug is Taxol, a breakthrough drug used to fight cancer in women. It was originally made from the bark of the Pacific Yew tree. The National Institutes of Health developed this drug which last year produced $1.5 billion in sales for the Bristol-Myers Squibb Company. 
   Let me repeat that. This was a drug that was developed by the National Institutes of Health. This was not a drug that came about through the genius of the private sector. It was a drug developed at the National Institutes of Health by dedicated scientists who worked hard and were pushing with every ounce of their strength to come up with new products to help women. 
   I want to outline specifically what they did in this case because it is a very clear illustration of why this amendment is needed. With respect to Taxol, the National Institutes of Health did the initial collection and re-collection of the bark of the Pacific Yew, which is the material from which the drug came. The National Institutes of Health performed all biological screening in both cell culture and animal tumor systems. The NIH did the chemical purification, isolation, and structure identification. The National Institutes of Health did large-scale production from bark collection through the preparation of material for human use. NIH developed and produced suitable intravenous drug formulations. They did the preclinical toxicology, they filed the Investigational New Drug Application, and they sponsored all the activities, including the efforts directed towards total and partial synthesis of the drug. 
   By the end of the fiscal year of 1992, NIH had invested $32 million. NIH could not manufacture the drug for commercial purposes, so it competitively bid to find a company to manufacture the drug. The Bristol-Myers Squibb Company was able to get exclusive rights to go forward with this pharmaceutical in the marketplace. 
   Frankly, at hearings I held in 1993, the company really could not specify what they had done at all, other than the preclinical work and research into alternatives. 
   So I come back to the fundamental proposition: Why is it that a pharmaceutical that was developed by the National Institutes of Health and resulted in $1.5 billion in sales in 1999 for Bristol-Myers Squibb resulted in no return on investment to the American taxpayer? This drug produced an enormous gain for an individual pharmaceutical company, yet the American taxpayer did not share in that gain. We are responsible to the taxpayer to be good financial stewards of their assets--in a sense the taxpayer saw their research walk out the door without adequate compensation for that massive taxpayer investment. 
   There are other examples of NIH research leading to block buster drugs. 
   One of those drugs found using NIH research and with more than $1 billion in sales is Prozac. The basic research in the development of Prozac was performed in the 1950s and 1960s by external researchers funded by NIH and researchers in NIH labs. Eli Lilly and Company developed Prozac based on this research. 
   In 1998, Prozac was third on the list of the top 200 brand-name prescription drugs in terms of units sold. Other drugs that relied on publicly-funded research were also on that list including Imitrex, Mevacor, and Zovirax. 
   Cisplatin is an anti-cancer drug discovered by a biophysicist at Michigan State University. National Cancer Institute scientists completed the pharmacology, toxicology, formulation, production and clinical trials. Michigan State University then licensed its patent to Bristol-Myers Squibb and the drug is used today to treat several types of cancer. 
   All of my colleagues have met with constituents suffering from diseases that we are so close to finding cures for. Diabetes and Parkinson's are just two areas that come to mind. 
   In this day of biomedical breakthroughs, it is important that the taxpayer not only see results of the research, but share in the gain that the multi-national drug companies also receive. 
   I have come to the floor, I think, now on more than 30 occasions to focus on the need for bipartisanship on this issue. Senator DASCHLE, in my view, has done yeoman's work, trying to bring people together. I hope we can, as we are seeking to do in this amendment, address these issues in a bipartisan fashion and particularly look to those areas with respect to prescription medicine that are going to be key for the future. 
   We know that absolutely vital to the health of this country is the research done at the National Institutes of Health. We have had many supporters in this body who have championed the cause of additional funding for NIH. I am especially appreciative of the work done by Senator MACK, for example, Senator HARKIN, and Senator SPECTER. They have been a bipartisan juggernaut, working for additional funding for research at the National Institutes of Health. 
   We also ought to recognize that when blockbuster drugs get to market as a result of that taxpayer-funded research, we have responsibilities to the taxpayers. We are stewards of their funds. It does not pass the smell test at  a townhall meeting to say that if the taxpayers spend vast sums for federally funded research and a company then makes huge profits in the private sector, the taxpayers get no return on that investment. 
   What we are making clear in this amendment is that Federal research should not be let go cheaply. It is important that taxpayers have a right to receive reimbursement when a blockbuster drug gets to market largely with their funds. 
   What this does is ensure, in a timely way, that the National Institutes of Health get to the Senate and the relevant committees a specific proposal to ensure, as Congressman BILL THOMAS, chairman of the House Ways and Means Subcommittee on Health, said recently:  
   Where taxpayers' money is being spent, there ought to be a return on that investment.  
   That is what this amendment does. Because of the Government's increased role in pharmaceutical development, with so many of the breakthrough drugs, particularly the cancer drugs, coming about because the taxpayer has paid for medically significant research, this amendment, in my view, addresses one of the important issues in the health care arena. 
   I want to wrap up by expressing my appreciation to Senator SPECTER and Senator HARKIN. If this amendment is adopted, I believe early next year we will have a specific game plan, a roadmap to ensure that taxpayers' interests are protected when they have done the heavy lifting in pharmaceutical development while, at the same time, having been fair to the entrepreneurs and pharmaceutical firms and others that work in this area. 
   I hope this amendment will be accepted by the majority and the minority. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. WYDEN. Mr President, I rise today to speak about the tragedy that is gun violence. 
   On May 21, 1998, 15 year-old Kip Kinkel walked into Thurston High School in Springfield, OR and opened fire with a semiautomatic rifle in a crowded cafeteria, killing two classmates and wounding two others. Kinkel had been arrested the day before the shooting for bringing a gun to school. However, police decided that he was not a threat and released him to his parents. The next morning, Kip Kinkel shot his parents to death at home before he went to school and opened fire on his classmates. 
   The entire state of Oregon went into shock. The Mayor of Springfield called upon lawmakers to institute a mandatory detention period for students caught bringing guns to school. In response, Senator GORDON SMITH and I introduced S. 2169, a bill that would provide a 25 percent increase in juvenile justice prevention funds to those states that implemented a 72-hour detention period for any student who brought a gun to school. 
   The idea behind the bill is straightforward. If a student brings a gun to school, he or she must be removed from the school and moved to a secure place where the student can be evaluated and the community protected. 
   A month later, on July 23, 1999 Senator SMITH and I offered a modified version of S. 2169 as an amendment to the Senate Commerce-Justice-State Appropriations bill. The ``24 Hour Rapid Response for Kids who Bring a Gun to School,'' amendment passed unanimously. Unfortunately, conservative House members, with close ties to the National Rifle Association, objected to any so called ``gun measures'' on the bill, and the amendment was removed. 
   On May 19, 1999, Senators SMITH, HATCH, and I teamed up to offer a revised version of the 24-hour Rapid Response amendment to S. 254, the Juvenile Justice bill. The amendment was accepted by the bill managers. Sadly, the bill has languished in the Conference Committee since that time. 
   Consequently, I have offered the 24-hour Rapid Response amendment on S. 1134, the Education Savings Act and S. 2, the Educational Opportunities Act, and will continue to offer it until such time that schools are safe for all our children. This is not about guns. It's about safety. 
   Since this amendment has not been enacted and because the legislation that would give law enforcement the tools to stop gun violence have been stalled, I come to the floor today to continue reading the names of those who fallen to gun violence. 
   Following are the names of some of the people who were killed by gunfire one year ago today, June 22, 1999:  
   Sean Atkins, 33, Baltimore, MD; Cedric Biglow, 22, Oklahoma City, OK; Michael A. Clifton, 35, Chicago, IL; Dredunn Cooper, 20, Houston, TX; Max Johnson, 28, Dallas, TX; Willie Ray Lewis, 23, New Orleans, LA; Rico Mosley, 19, Atlanta, GA; Richard Neely, 75, Chicago, IL; James Edward Shea, 75, Cape Coral, FL; Steve Taylor, 25, Philadelphia, PA; Joel A. Thompson, 20, Chicago, IL; Michael Williams, Atlanta, GA; Marduke Jones, Detroit, MI

<TEXT>
   Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, before the Senator from Massachusetts leaves the floor, I want to make clear that, in all the years of Senator KENNEDY's championing the cause of civil rights, we have looked to him for his leadership. I believe this is a particularly important cause he champions today at a particularly important time. I hope my colleagues will reflect carefully on what Senator KENNEDY has said today. He will be leading us in the debate on this issue next week. I am honored to be working with him. 
   As Senator KENNEDY said so eloquently, this is about one proposition and one proposition alone, and that is we are seeking to deter violent crime borne out of prejudice and hatred. So often we hear discussions about preferences for individuals, advantages that might in some way be bestowed with respect to civil rights statutes. That is not what this legislation does at all. 
   This legislation is about deterring violence, deterring crime, deterring these extraordinary acts of violence that, in my view, stain our national greatness. We are not going to be able to remove that stain completely. We are not going to be able to stop individuals from having hateful and prejudicial thoughts. Clearly, we can put the Federal Government in a position to be a stronger, more effective partner with local law enforcement officials in fighting this scourge that has affected so many of our communities. 
   This is not a time for further study. This is not a time to say the Federal Government's response should only be to collect statistics. This is a time for the Federal Government 
   to work in partnership with State and local law enforcement officials so that we have the strongest, most effective, most coherent mobilization against these acts of violence and prejudice that we possibly can muster. 
   Our bipartisan amendment, led by Senator KENNEDY, does three things: It removes the restrictions on the types of situations in which the Justice Department can prosecute defendants for violent crimes based on race, color, religion, or national origin. 
   Second, it will assure that crimes targeted against victims because of disability, gender, or sexual orientation that cause death or bodily injury can be prosecuted if there is a sufficient connection to interstate commerce. 
   Third, it requires the Attorney General to certify in writing that he or she has reasonable cause to believe that the crime was motivated by bias and that, in fact, the Federal Government had been in close consultation with State and local law enforcement officials and that they did not have any objection to Federal help or that they had asked for Federal assistance. 
   This is not a question of the Federal Government coming in and saying: We are going to call all the shots, and preempt the local jurisdictions. In fact, we want to support those local jurisdictions. We have 28 States in this country that have no authority to prosecute bias-motivated crimes based on disability or sexual orientation. We have a substantial number of States in this country that lack the legal authority to address these issues that are so important to the fundamental values of this country. 
   We are not saying that every single crime in America is a hate crime. We certainly know that all crimes are tragic, and we grieve for the families, but not all crimes are based on hate. A hate crime is one where the perpetrator intentionally chooses the victim because of who the victim is. It is our view that a hate crime affects not only the victim, but if it goes unaddressed, it cheapens all of us. It makes our country a little bit less special because it demeans an entire community, it demeans all of us in our Nation. 
   This is not providing special protection to certain groups. It makes sure we stand up for the rights of those individuals who are singled out solely for reasons borne out of hatred and prejudice and we not allow those in our country who do wish to harm these individuals to perpetrate these brutal acts with no response from our communities. 
   Some argue that hate crime laws threaten free speech. In the law we are hoping the Senate will adopt, it does not punish beliefs or thoughts. We are not punishing those in this legislation; we are punishing violent acts. I know of no Member of the Senate who is pro-violence. I do not think there is a single Member of the Senate who wants to be on the cause or in support of violent acts. Here we draw the line in the sand and we say we are not going to get in the way of people's thoughts and beliefs, lawful expression of one's deeply held religious views, but we are saying that causing or attempting to cause bodily injury is not speech protected by the first amendment. 
   I am very hopeful that in the next few days the Senate will support this legislation. We are not federalizing criminal activity that is better left to the States. I mentioned the fact that so many States in our country lack these laws, and we have gone beyond the time to just study this and collect further statistics. If one looks at what happened in the brutal instance of Matthew Shepard and the horrific murder of James Byrd, Jr., it is awfully hard to say as you look at those brutal acts: We ought to study things a little bit more and collect some statistics before the Federal Government, in effect, acts to be a better partner with State and local authorities in addressing these issues. 
   It is time to correct the deficiencies in current law. A crime motivated by race, religion, or ethnic origin can be prosecuted by Federal authorities because it occurred on a public sidewalk but not if it took place in a private parking lot across the street. This is just one example of the gaps and the deficiencies in the current hate crimes statute. 
   When we vote on this issue, there will be support from Senators on both sides of the aisle. 
   I commend my friend and colleague from Oregon, Senator GORDON SMITH, who has stood with me again and again on this issue. 
   When we vote on this, it seems to me, this will be nothing short of a referendum in the Senate on whether this body is going to continue to tolerate violent acts born of prejudice. 
   As I mentioned, I do not know of any Senator who is in favor of violence. Violent acts, born of prejudice--acts that we all know are wrong--are taking place in too many communities in our country. They are a stain on our national greatness. 
   The evidence is in, and it is clear. It is time, through Federal legislation, to send a strong and unequivocal message that we will not look the other way in the face of these crimes, that they will not be tolerated, that the full force of Federal law enforcement will be brought, and will be brought in conjunction with State and local authorities, to ensure that these violent acts are prosecuted and we have taken every step to deter them. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, almost a year ago, this country's airlines made a grand announcement about a new, although albeit voluntary, commitment to the rights of airline passengers. 
   I tend to look with a very skeptical eye at any promise to consumers that contains the notion of both ``voluntary'' and ``rights'' together in the same sentence. 
   Now, 1 year later, my conversations with Federal investigators about the work they have done, at the Senate's request, leaves me to be even more skeptical of what the airlines have promised. 
   What I have learned from Federal investigators is that there are more questions than answers about the quality of airline customer service, flight delays, and the airline ticket distribution system. 
   Frankly, as I said a year ago, the evidence indicates that the airlines' so-called customer first package has proven to be worth little more than the paper it was written on. 
   In fact, just recently, in the last few months, the Washington Post Business Section had a headline that said: ``Airline Service Dips n 3 of 4 Categories.'' They went on to describe what can only be categorized as a pretty bumpy operation with respect to guaranteeing the rights of passengers in this country. 
   I will take just a few minutes to outline what I think the central problems are, and what I have learned from Federal investigators about their work. Then I hope the Senate will support my amendment on a bipartisan basis. 
   First, after a year of trying to get the airlines to be straight with the American consumer with respect to finding the lowest fare available on a particular flight, I can report that finding the lowest airfare remains one of the great mysteries of our time. 
   On any given flight, there may be as many different fares paid as there are passengers on the plane. Finding out if the flight you want to take is overbooked is sort of like playing hide and seek. First, you have to know what to ask for. Then you need to know the difference between a flight that is oversold and a flight that is overbooked. Suffice it to say, there seem to be a fair number of people in the industry who can hardly explain that difference. 
   When I first called for the passage of a real, enforceable passenger bill of rights for airline consumers, I made it very clear to the Senate that I was not talking about establishing a constitutional right to a fluffy pillow on your airplane flight. I was not talking about folks being entitled to a jumbo bag of peanuts. What I was talking about has the public's right to know, the public's right to know information about basic services, just as they do in every other area of our economy. 
   In every other area of the economy, such as when you have a reservation for a particular item or you want to find out about how it is priced, you can get that information. You can get it whether it is on the telephone, at the counter, online, or through a variety of intermediaries. And you are told, in straightforward kinds of terms, the real reasons behind these scheduling arrangements, and prices, and the kind of information that is so relevant to the consumer. 
   That is not what is happening today in the airline industry, despite the grandiose pledges from folks in the industry. 
   For example, the annual survey by leading scholars at Wichita State who have been doing these surveys for many years came out in April and found that consumer complaints on air travel in 1999 were up 130 percent over the previous year. That study showed that 7 out of 10 airlines posted lower quality ratings than they did in the previous year. 
   Earlier this year, the Department of Transportation consumer division reported that the number of complaints they had received was about double that of the previous year. The complaints were up and the ratings were down after the airlines had pledged to the Congress to do better. 
   Suffice it to say, these professors at Wichita State are not airline industry bashers. These are individuals who, by their own description, take a very conservative orientation to these issues. Yet they found that in virtually every important area of consumer service, there had actually been a deterioration in the quality of service to airline passengers during this period since the airlines' so-called customer first pledge went into effect. 
   When the industry's Air Transport Association reported recently that customer satisfaction was at an all-time high, many of us struggled to find out to whom exactly they were talking. They weren't talking to the folks I sit next to on an airplane or the people I meet in ticket lines at home in Oregon or around the Pacific Northwest. 
   I can understand the inclination of the Senate to give the airlines some time to try to make their voluntary program work. I got my head handed to me when we had the vote in the Commerce Committee and it was 19-1 with respect to airline passenger rights. I respected that. Given the results in the Commerce Committee, I decided we ought to try to do some followup and offered several amendments that were accepted as part of this appropriations bill in the last year. I believed it was important to continue to monitor the situation to see if we would get any improvements since the industry's pledges went into effect. 
   What we adopted in the last appropriations bill was part of the final law. It was binding, and it gave the Transportation Department inspector general a statutory mandate to look at whether airlines are giving customers access to the lowest fares no matter what technology they used to contact the airline. It is outrageous to know that even today airline passengers can be quoted one price over the telephone and yet a much lower fare is available to them on the Internet and they aren't given that kind of information. The Department of Transportation inspector general was directed in the last appropriations bill to investigate that issue and, in addition, to make sure we monitor this question of the lowest fare. 
   We directed the inspector general to tell us about overbookings of flights--again, a right-to-know context. I have no problem with an airline selling a ticket to a passenger on a flight that is overbooked, if the consumer is told that the flight is overbooked at the time they are going to make the purchase. It is fairly straightforward; it is informed consent. We have found that has not been done. 
   The Department of Transportation inspector general is also looking at a new scheme the airlines have cooked up known as T-2. It is our understanding this is a new online pool of airfares where nearly all of the major air carriers will offer their lowest fares but which will not be accessible to those who offer travel services. 
   In a few weeks, the inspector general of the Department of Transportation is going to issue an interim report on the airlines' customer service commitment plans. What I have heard about this report is that the airlines are coming up short, and seriously so, with respect to following up on the commitments they made to the Congress. 
   For example, recent weather delays at Chicago's O'Hare Airport resulted in numerous planes being stranded on the runways for periods of 3 hours or more and as long as 8 hours. The Presiding Officer must have heard from some of his constituents on that matter. I happen to have been on the flight that was going from Chicago to Portland where some of those folks had been on the flight that had been stranded in Chicago. They told me all they had received during this extended wait was granola bars and almost no information at all about the options they had. 
   A recent power failure at National Airport in the Nation's Capital stranded scores of passengers without any accommodations or emergency provisions. Again, we have the consumer complaints pouring into the Department of Transportation at record levels  each month of this year, after the airline industry's voluntary pledge went into effect. This notion from the airline industry that they just need more time, give them a little bit more opportunity to make this so-called voluntary program work, is contradicted by what we have seen each month since the so-called voluntary pledges went into effect. 
   The customer service commitments don't even address one of the most frustrating areas of air travel; that is, the fundamental underlying issue of delays and what the airlines and the FDA will do to combat them. 
   It is important that we get the Department of Transportation interim report. It is going to offer the American people an unbiased view of exactly how well airlines are treating passengers. It is going to give us an independent assessment of these so-called voluntary passenger commitments. 
   I believe what this report is going to show is that the pledges the airline industry made are in effect a kind of cosmetic program to try to keep the Senate from enacting real passenger rights that are enforceable and truly protect the American public. I suspect what we will hear from the inspector general will be a blueprint for enforceable concrete legislation that protects the rights of passengers. 
   What the Senate ought to be doing is keeping the airlines' feet to the fire. That is why I am offering an amendment to this year's Department of Transportation appropriations bill that would instruct the Department of Transportation IG to continue his fact finding and information gathering in key areas that are so important to the public. I am talking about whether these customer service practices amount to anything, getting the public straight information on the lowest available fare, information about overbooking. 
   Importantly, for the first time the Senate would direct the Department of Transportation IG to look at the question of whether mergers in the airline industry are causing customer service to deteriorate. We ought to be looking at that issue. We ought to be looking at whether legislation should be enacted to require that customer service be a factor in granting an airline merger in this country. We have all heard so much about these airline mergers. We are having a lot of problems with customer service today. We ought to be looking at the ramifications these mergers are having on the quality of airline service in this country. 
   I am particularly interested in knowing whether the Senate, on a bipartisan basis, should write a law that would stipulate whether or not customer service ought to be a factor in the merger review process. In addition, this amendment would review the reasons for increases in flight delay. We have had some folks say it is the FAA's fault. We have had other folks say that it is the airline industry's fault. I think the Department of Transportation IG ought to dig into that issue. My amendment also requires a review of the airline ticket distribution system that I mentioned earlier involving T-2. Suffice it to say that there are a number of questions there about whether that is contributing to problems that consumers are having. 
   The bottom line is, will the Senate keep the airlines' feet to the fire? Are we going to have the Department of Transportation continue in this investigative effort to try to at least put some kind of collective focus by the Senate on how important it is to improve passenger service? We have all heard from constituents, at a time when the airlines are, in many instances, making great profits, about why it is that some of that money can't be devoted to improving passenger service. 
   I am not going to go through all of the recent news stories but just a few of the headlines. The Washington Post headline is ``Airline Service Dips In 3 of 4 Categories.'' The Los Angeles Times headline is ``Air Passengers `Fed Up' With Poor Service, Survey Finds.'' They go on to cite the fact that ``Consumer complaints against airlines have more than doubled from last year.'' 
   In conjunction with the recommendations we are getting from the Department of Transportation's IG and their leading official, who I think does a superlative job in this area, I would like to see the Senate working with the Transportation inspector general to keep the focus on trying to force these airlines to improve the quality of passenger service to the people of this country. 
   I have just been informed by the staff that Chairman MCCAIN and Senator HOLLINGS and Senator ROCKEFELLER would be willing to join me today in committing to send a letter asking the Department of Transportation inspector general to investigate and report to the committee on the issues that are the subject of my amendment. So that the record is clear, Chairman MCCAIN, Senator HOLLINGS, and Senator ROCKEFELLER--and they are all the leaders of the Senate Commerce Committee and spend many hours looking into these issues--have all asked that they join me in a letter to the Department of Transportation inspector general inquiring into the issues that are the subject of my amendment. 
   The fact that we are getting the bipartisan leadership of our committee behind this effort is very important. It is certainly important to me because all of them have great expertise regarding this issue. My inclination, frankly, is to have a vote on this amendment on the floor of the Senate to send the strongest possible message. But I note that Senator ROCKEFELLER cannot be present today. He has done extremely good and important work on a whole host of aviation issues, including the air traffic control system. As a member of the Commerce Committee and the Aviation Subcommittee, which has jurisdiction over these issues, I am going to agree this afternoon, on the basis of the fact that we will now have a bipartisan letter sent to the inspector general by the bipartisan leadership of the Commerce Committee directing that the IG look into all of the issues outlined in my amendment, to withdraw my amendment. 
   But I want to make it clear to people in the airline industry and the passengers that are so frustrated by these delays that this fight is going to continue. It is not being dropped. In fact, we are expanding it. As I mentioned, we are going to look, for the first time in recent years, at the ramifications of mergers on customer service. I happen to believe very strongly that mergers and customer service are inextricably linked. I think we ought to change the law and stipulate that one of the criteria on whether or not an airline merger ought to go forward is customer service.

   Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I rise to voice my concerns about Section 335 of the Transportation Appropriations bill.  This section flatly bans the Department of Transportation from even considering any reform of the commercial drivers' Hours of Service (HOS) regulations, which limit the time that drivers spend behind the wheel of large trucks and buses. The provision shuts off all funding for DOT current and future efforts to ensure drivers receive adequate rest. This sweeping ban on any further consideration of HOS regulations goes too far. 
   Section 335 would not even give DOT a chance to try to address concerns that have been raised about its proposed regulations. DOT would be prohibited from holding public hearings on the changes (several are planned for this month alone) or from even talking with drivers, law enforcement groups, and highway safety groups about the proposed changes. The measure also halts efforts to enhance HOS enforcement through on-board recorders--one of the National Transportation Safety Board's ten most wanted safety improvements. 
   The ban on any consideration of HOS reform also contradicts Congress' recent action to improve truck safety. Just last year Congress mandated the creation of a new truck safety agency within DOT, the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration. It is FMCSA's proposal to change the HOS regulations which has led to the ban in section 335 of the Transportation Appropriations bill. Moreover, in 1995, the Congress, through the medium of the Interstate Commerce Commission Termination Act (ICCTA), directed DOT to study the HOS regulations and suggest reforms. DOT and FMCSA have done so. The result of their efforts should not be the foreclosing of all debate on new driver safety rules.

   Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, the conference agreement on digital signatures that is going to be overwhelmingly approved tomorrow morning may be the big sleeper of this Congress, but it certainly was not the ``big easy.'' 
   The fact of the matter is, when we started on this in March of 1999, Senator ABRAHAM and I envisioned a fairly simple interim bill. We were looking at electronic signatures to make sure that in the online world, when you sent an electronic signature, it would carry the same legal weight as a ``John Hancock'' in the offline world. 
   But as we prepared--after this passed the Commerce Committee--to move forward with a pretty innocuous bill, the financial services and insurance industries came to us with what we thought was a very important and thoughtful concept; and that was to revolutionize e-commerce, to go beyond establishing the legal validity of e-signatures to include electronic records, keeping important records electronically. We were told by industry--and correctly so--that this would give America a chance to save billions and billions of dollars and thousands of  hours, as our companies chose to spend their funds on matters other than paper recordkeeping. 
   At the same time, the consumer groups that sought this proposal were extremely frightened. They saw this as an opportunity for unscrupulous individuals to come on in and rip off senior citizens, to foreclose on people's homes, to cut off health insurance, and things of that nature, by just perhaps an e-mail into cyberspace. 
   Chairman MCCAIN is here. This is truly a bipartisan effort in every respect. I had a chance to work with my senior colleagues on this side, Senator LEAHY, Senator HOLLINGS, Senator SARBANES, and our friend Senator KERRY, who is here. And let me tell you, it ultimately took three Senate committees 8 months and thousands of hours to get it done. We had to bring together key principles of what is known as the old economy, such as consumer protection and informed consent, and fuse them together with the principles of the new economy and the online world, and the chance to save time and money through electronic records and electronic signatures. 
   What we tried to say, on this side of the aisle, and what we were able to get a bipartisan agreement around, is the proposition that consumer rights are not virtual rights. We have to make sure--and we have it in this legislation--that the protections that apply offline would apply online. We were able to do it without enduring all kinds of unnecessary redtape and bureaucracy. 
   I wanted the bill to unleash the potential of electronic signatures and records for industry without shattering a cornerstone of American commerce: the right of individual consumers to have meaningful and informed consent and to keep accurate records of their contracts and transactions. 
   I believe the conference agreement before the Senate has met the challenge of protecting consumer rights in the new economy. 
   Consumer rights are not virtual rights. Consumers must enjoy the same basic rights in the online world as they have in the off-line world. Through the electronic consumer consent provision in Section 101(c) that I authored with Senators Leahy, Hollings and SARBANES, I believe we have adequately translated offline consumer protections into online consumer protections. 
   Let me just spend a minute describing this key provision of the conference agreement. This provision requires that consumer consent must be meaningful. We all know of cases where someone said, ``Just e-mail me that document,'' only to have that person call later, saying ``Gee, I couldn't open the document, can you fax it to me?'' I can't recall how many times this exact thing happened to our own staff during the negotiation of this agreement. 
   Meaningful consumer consent doesn't mean being given a pageful of hardware and software specification gobbledygook. It means consenting electronically so that a consumer knows he or she can receive, read and retain the information in an electronic record. 
   Section 101(c) provides that if a statute, regulation or other rule of law requires that information relating to a transaction be provided or made available to a consumer in writing, the vendor can use electronic means if the consumer, prior to consenting, has been given a clear and conspicuous statement of his or her rights. The consumer must be informed of the option of getting the record on paper, and what the consequences are if he or she later withdraws the electronic consent in favor of returning to paper records. Some vendors, for example, may be able to achieve considerable savings by using electronic records, and offer customers a much more attractive price for doing business online rather than through traditional paper and snail mail. But a vendor might not want to be locked into a lower price if the buyer reverts to paper later in the life of the contract. This provision will assure a consumer will be informed up front of any change in the cost if the consumer withdraws consent to receive records electronically subsequent to consummation of the contract. This could happen, for instance, if a consumer finds he cannot access the documents electronically, or the vendor chooses to upgrade his software and the consumer does not want to go to the expense of upgrading his system to accommodate the change. 
   The consumer must also be informed of the hardware and software necessary to access and retain records electronically, how to withdraw electronic consent, how to update information needed to contact the consumer electronically, the categories of records that will be provided or made available electronically, how a consumer may request a paper copy of an electronic record and whether a fee will be charged for such copy. If a vendor changes the electronic system used to obtain the original consent electronically, the vendor must obtain the consent electronically again using the new system and the same two-way consent process. 
   Most importantly, the consumer must consent electronically or confirm his or her consent electronically in a manner that reasonably demonstrates that the consumer can access the information in the electronic form that will be used to provide the information. This is critical. ``Reasonably demonstrates'' means just that. It means the consumer can prove his or her ability to access the electronic information that will be provided. It means the consumer, in response to an electronic vendor enquiry, actually opens an attached document sent electronically by the vendor and confirms that ability in an e-mail response. 
   It means there is a two-way street. It is not sufficient for the vendor to tell the consumer what type of computer or software he or she needs. It is not sufficient for the consumer merely to tell the vendor in an e-mail that he or she can access the information in the specified formats. There must be meaningful two-way communication electronically between the vendor and consumer. 
   At the heart of these provisions is the concern--shared by many in the industry as well--that electronic communication, e-mail, is not as reliable or as ubiquitous as traditional first class mail. Until advances in electronic mail technology eliminate such concerns and until the vast majority of Americans are comfortable using the technology of the New Economy, consent to use electronic records requires special care and attention. Because of such concerns, there are some areas where the use of electronic notice and records are simply not appropriate today. Section 103 of the conference agreement recognizes this by continuing to require paper notice. These areas include shutting off a consumer's utilities, canceling or terminating health insurance or benefits or life insurance benefits, foreclosing on someone's primary residence, recall of a product that risks endangering health or safety and documents required to accompany the transportation or handling of hazardous materials, pesticides, or other toxic or dangerous materials. What happens, for example, if a hazmat truck loaded with toxic waste spills its cargo, endangering a community, and the only notice about the hazardous cargo was posted on the company's website? Is it fair to allow a mortgage lender to foreclosure on someone's home just because their ISP went out of business and they weren't receiving their payment notices electronically? The exceptions we fought for in this section of the conference agreement will protect consumers.

   Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, today, the opportunity to live a healthy and productive life can be enriched by something new: access to the Internet. But according to a 1999 Forrester Research report, only 8 percent of seniors age 65 and above have Internet access compared to 40 percent of the population under age 65. According to an unpublished Department of Commerce study, the percentage of low-income seniors with Internet access is even less: only 1.5 percent. My bill, the Internet Access for Seniors Act of 2000, will help narrow this digital divide between seniors and the rest of the population. I am pleased to be joined by Senators DEWINE and ROCKEFELLER in introducing this bill. 
   A recent study by Stanford's Institute for the Quantitative Study of Society shows the digital divide among different demographic groups. The variables are age, education, gender, race, ethnicity, and income. It shows that by far the most important factors facilitating or inhibiting Internet access are age and education--not income, not race, not ethnicity, and not gender. According to the study's authors, these variables account for less than 5 percent of the change in the rates of Internet access and are statistically insignificant. In contrast, and I quote, ``a college education boosts rates of Internet access by well over 40 percentage points compared to the less educated group, while people over 65 show a more than 40 percentage point drop in their rates of Internet access compared to those under 25.'' 
   Ironically, seniors, who have more limited access to the Internet, can benefit more from Internet access than others because, in addition to a digital divide, they suffer from a transportation divide. The ability to travel from one place to another is vital to our daily lives. In fact, good transportation access is vital for many of the same reasons as good Internet access. But seniors are the least mobile demographic segment of our adult population. One way that people cope with poor access to telecommunications is to rely on transportation. But seniors lack this coping mechanism. In other words, if any demographic group in our society actually needs superior access to the Internet, it is seniors. 
   Our society has long recognized that access to certain kinds of information is a public good. That is why we have schools and libraries, and it is why we have the E-rate, which provides Internet access to schools and libraries. Until now, however, senior centers have been left out of the mix. Some may say, ``Why don't seniors go to the library to get Internet access?'' Many seniors prefer to go to senior centers because they are specifically designed to serve their needs. For example, senior centers routinely provide some type of special transportation for seniors to get to and from the senior centers. Asking libraries to take on the added cost of providing such transportation is clearly less desirable from a cost--not to mention logistical--standpoint. When a senior makes the effort to get to a senior center, he can take advantage of a half dozen services specifically designed to serve his needs, and it seems wasteful to ask libraries to take on those additional services. 
   There are many ways seniors can benefit from Internet access: taking courses, finding a job, becoming better-informed citizens, and shopping for essential goods and services. One application, access to health information, is obviously essential to seniors and is also an area of great interest to me. 
   Mr. President, there is an explosion of useful health information being made available over the Internet. According to a recent front page New York Times story, there are now more than 100,000 healthcare websites available on the Internet. Health information is being made available on the Internet because consumers demand it. 
   There are many reasons seniors may prefer to get health information over the Internet rather than in person. 
   Some seniors may not want to wait until their next doctor appointment before finding out more about their ailment. For example, if a senior gets a diagnosis of cancer, she may not want to wait to find out more about the seriousness of her condition and the options available. 
   Some seniors may find a trip to the clinician's office an onerous and often all-day activity. Clearly the ability to communicate with a clinician without making a special trip--and at odd hours--would be of great benefit. Recognizing these needs, some HMOs already allow seniors to communicate with their caregiver via the Internet to request relatively routine services such as a dosage change. This also saves on Medicare costs. 
   Some seniors may want to talk to other people who share their condition. For example, most medical websites now have chat rooms where fellow sufferers can get together to share information about new treatment options and day-to-day tips for coping with specific conditions. These sites also provide advice and support to the spouses and other caregivers who must care for victims of Alzheimer's, heart disease, cancer, and other afflictions of the elderly. 
   My legislation is designed to bring senior centers, particularly those in low-income or rural areas, into the digital age. I chose senior centers as a vehicle to alleviate the digital divide for seniors because these centers serve large numbers of seniors, especially the disadvantaged seniors targeted by this bill. Unfortunately, there are no national statistics regarding how many senior centers have computers with Internet access accessible to seniors. However, my office did a survey of Oregon senior centers. We found that 52 percent lacked access to computers and that 71 percent lacked access to the Internet. In many cases, the quality of computers and Internet access was low. Many computers were at least five years old. Some were ten or more years old. Internet connections were often made with older versions of browsers that could not access contemporary web sites. 
   My bill has two major components. The first provides a tax credit for individuals and organizations that contribute computer equipment to senior centers. The second creates a 
   pilot program, called the S-rate, to provide subsidies for qualified low-income or rural senior centers to access the Internet. 
   The tax credit, essentially identical to the tax credit for computer equipment donated to schools passed March 1 of this year in the New Millennium Classrooms Act, is equal to 30 percent of the fair market value of the donated computer equipment. To receive the tax deduction, the computer equipment must be three years old or less. For donations to senior centers located within empowerment zones, enterprise communities, and Indian reservations, the tax credit is increased to 50 percent. The tax deduction is terminated for taxable years beginning three years after the date of enactment of this act, and we impose a limit of 10 computers per senior center. 
   The S-rate covers up to 90 percent of the costs associated with Internet access to senior centers. Covered costs include computers, software, training, and maintenance. Our bill seeks to narrow the increasingly important divide between information haves and have-nots in our society. Our bill is only a pilot program that will invest $10 million a year in getting our seniors online. The program sunsets after 3 years. 
   The Secretary of the Department of Commerce will administer the S-rate. In selecting among eligible senior centers, the Secretary will consider the senior center's need and proposed applications. Need includes the number of seniors served by the senior center, the extent to which the senior center already provides Internet access, and the extent to which the senior center serves an area with a high percentage of low-income or rural individuals. Applications include health information, job training, lifelong education, and any other applications that fulfill an important social need. 
   One of the Secretary's tasks is to develop enabling tools for the senior centers. For example, the Secretary could offer an array of fill-in-the-blank web  templates to make it easy for senior centers to post information on the web and create their own home pages. The Secretary could provide information to senior centers about privacy concerns, especially regarding sensitive matters such as health information. The Secretary could suggest minimum standards for web hosting services seeking to serve senior centers. 
   One of the wonderful things about the Internet is the ability of one site to learn from another. The Secretary could create a web-based clearinghouse of all the senior centers funded under the pilot program. Innovative and outstanding web-based services could be specially marked so that other senior centers could quickly learn from the best practices of others. The Secretary could set up a technical chat room so that senior center administrators, in their role as webmasters, could share concerns and ideas. The Secretary could set up an Internet hotline for oversight; that is, to be alerted if an administrator doesn't use the S-rate for its stated purpose. And because the Internet can be used for distance education and online help, the Secretary could fund some senior centers to train other senior citizens. 
   Let me close with one further thought. Closing the digital divide for seniors is not just about social justice; it's also about basic dollars and cents. Consider this: according to the National Institute of Aging, more than two-thirds of every healthcare dollar--much of it government funded--goes to seniors. If we can empower seniors to be wise health consumers, we can use market mechanisms, rather than government red tape, to make sure that seniors get the healthcare they need. The Internet now offers that opportunity. Let's not squander it.

   Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Little Sandy Watershed Protection Act. 
   I promised Oregonians that my first legislative business when Congress reconvened after the Memorial Day Recess would be the introduction of this bill. 
   Therefore, joined by my friends Senator GORDON SMITH and Congressman EARL BLUMENAUER, I introduce this legislation to make sure that Portland families can go to their kitchen faucets and get a glass of safe and pure drinking water today, tomorrow, and on, into the 21st century. 
   The Bull Run has been the primary source of water for Portland since 1895. The Bull Run Watershed Management Unit, Mount Hood National Forest, was protected by Congressional action in 1904, 1977 and then again, most recently, in 1996 (P.L. 95-200, 16, U.S.C. 482b note) because it was recognized as Portland's primary municipal water supply. It still is. 
   Today I propose to finish the job of the Oregon Resources and Conservation Act of 1996. That law, which I worked on with Senator Mark Hatfield, finally provided full protection to the Bull Run watershed, but only provided temporary protection for the adjacent Little Sandy watershed. I promised in 1996 that I would return to finish the job of protecting Portland's drinking water supply and intend to continue to push this legislation until the job is complete. 
   The bill I introduce today expands the Bull Run Watershed Management Unit boundary from approximately 95,382 acres to approximately 98,272 acres by adding the southern portion of the Little Sandy River watershed, an increase of approximately 2,890 acres. 
   The protection this bill offers will not only assure clean drinking water, but also increase the potential for fish recovery. Reclaiming suitable habitat for our region's threatened fish populations must be an all-out effort.  Through the cooperation of Portland General Electric and the City of Portland, the Little Sandy can be an important part of that effort. 
   My belief is that the children of the 21st century deserve water that is as safe and pure as any that the Oregon pioneers found in the 19th century. This legislation will go a long way toward bringing about that vision.

    Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation which was actually authored by Senators NICKLES and HATCH, and which they have entitled the ``Pain Relief Promotion Act.'' Their bill which I am now introducing is identical to H.R. 2260 as reported out of the Judiciary Committee on April 27, 2000, as amended. Today, it has been referred by the Senate Parliamentarian to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP). 
   While I remain steadfastly opposed to the ``Pain Relief Promotion Act of 2000,'' I am introducing this bill for one reason: to call the Senate's attention to the fact that a far-reaching health policy bill--which many experts believe has the potential to sentence millions of sick and dying patients across the nation to needless pain and suffering--was mistakenly referred to a committee with insufficient health policy resources and no health policy jurisdiction. It is that bill which the Judiciary Committee reported and which, without consideration by the committee with health expertise, the Republican leadership wants to bring to the floor. The unintended consequence of this could be the tragic decline of the quality of pain care across our nation. 
   Some historical context might help my colleagues and their staff better understand how the Senate finds itself in this unfortunate situation, and the important issues that are at stake. On two separate occasions, the State of Oregon passed a ballot measure that would allow terminally ill persons, with less than six months left to live, to obtain a physician-assisted suicide if they met a variety of safeguard requirements. As a private citizen, I voted twice with the minority of my state in opposition to that measure. 
   In response to Oregon's vote, several of our congressional colleagues, including Senator NICKLES, Senator LIEBERMAN, and Congressman HENRY HYDE, promptly undertook legislative and other efforts to overturn Oregon's law. I do not, for the purposes of today, debate the merits of the Oregon law, or the merits of physician-assisted suicide, generally. 
   The original ``Pain Relief Promotion Act,'' S. 1272, was introduced in the Senate by Senator NICKLES, and referred to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions (HELP) on June 23, 1999. That committee held one inconclusive hearing on October 13, 1999, at which time it was reported that Senators on both sides of the aisle wished to investigate the matter more thoroughly before acting on the legislation. 
   Then, on November 19, 1999, Bob Dove, the Senate Parliamentarian, made what he termed ``a mistake'' when he referred H.R. 2260-- the virtually identical House-passed version of the ``Pain Relief Promotion Act''--to the Senate Judiciary Committee. Over the course of my service in the Senate, I have come to know Mr. Dove to be a man of integrity and fairness, and one of the most dedicated and enduring public servants in Washington, D.C. When he discovered his mistake, to his great credit, Mr. Dove did something all-too-rare in this town; he simply acknowledged his error. According to an article by the Associated Press on December 7, 1999, Mr. Dove stated plainly that he had mistakenly referred the bill to the Judiciary Committee, instead of the HELP Committee. 
   Lord knows I've made a few mistakes in my day, so I want to make clear that I harbor nothing but respect for Mr. Dove, and that I do not for one second question Mr. Dove's motives. But the mistake made on November 19, 1999, if left uncorrected, threatens unspeakably negative and long-lasting consequences for the future of health care in this nation. 
   The jurisdiction of the HELP Committee over the ``Pain Relief Promotion Act'' is clear. The Senate Manual describes the jurisdiction of this committee as including ``measures relating to education, labor, health, and public welfare''. The Senate Manual also describes the HELP Committee as having jurisdiction over aging, biomedical research and development, handicapped individuals, occupational safety and health, and public health. 
   According to the Senate Manual, the jurisdiction of the Judiciary Committee includes bankruptcy, mutiny, espionage, counterfeiting, civil liberties, constitutional amendments, federal courts and judges, government information, holidays and celebrations, immigration and naturalization, interstate compacts generally, judicial proceedings, local courts in territories and possessions, measures relating to claims against the United States, national penitentiaries, patent office, patents, copyrights trademarks, protection of trade and commerce against unlawful restraints and monopolies, revision and codification of the statutes of the United States, and state and territorial boundary lines. 
   The committee jurisdiction is not a close call, in this case. As the Senate's leading expert on jurisdiction has now demonstrated, this bill is fundamentally an issue of medical practice, which clearly is within the jurisdiction of the HELP Committee. 
   Congress has heard conflicting messages from respected medical experts on both sides of this debate about whether the ``Pain Relief Promotion Act'' may, in fact, have a chilling effect on physicians' pain management, thus actually increasing suffering at the end of life. Under the legislation, federal, state, and local law enforcement could receive training to begin scrutinizing physicians' end-of-life care. Many believe that the legislation sends the wrong signal to physicians and others caring for those who are dying, noting the disparity between the $5 million allotted for training in palliative care and the $80 million potentially available for law enforcement activities. 
   In addition, there is considerable concern that this legislation puts into statute perceptions about pain medication that the scientific world has been trying to change. Physicians often believe that the aggressive use of certain pain medications, such as morphine, will hasten death. Recent scientific studies show this is not the case. Dr. Kathleen M. Foley, Attending Neurologist in the Pain and Palliative Care Service at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center and Professor of Neurology, Neuroscience and Clinical Pharmacology at the Cornell University, had this to say about the Nickles-Hatch legislation, ``In short, the underpinnings of this legislation are not based on scientific evidence. It would be unwise to institutionalize the myth into law that pain medications hasten death.'' 
   Renowned medical ethicist, and Director of the Center for Bioethics at the University of Pennsylvania, Arthur L. Caplan, Ph.D., also appeared before the Senate Judiciary Committee on April 25, 2000. He testified that: ``Doctors and nurses may not always fully understand what the law permits or does not, but when the issue requires an assessment of intent in an area as fraught with nuances and pitfalls as end of life care then I believe that this legislation will scare many doctors and nurses and administrators into inaction in the face of pain.'' 
   Dr. Scott Fishman, the Chief of the Division of Pain Medicine and Associate Professor of Anesthesiology at the University of California Davis School of Medicine wrote of the Hatch substitute: ``It is ironic that the `Hatch substitute', which seeks to prevent physician assisted suicide, will ultimately impair one of the truly effective counters to physician assisted suicide, which is swift and effective pain medicine.'' 
   Dr. Foley, who also assisted the Institute of Medicine committee that wrote the report ``Approaching Death,'' further testified that, ``The Pain Relief Promotion Act, by expanding the authority of the Controlled Substances Act, will disturb the balance that we have worked so hard to create. Physician surveys by the New York State Department of Health have shown that a strict regulatory environment negatively impacts physician prescribing practices and leads them to intentionally undertreat patients with pain  because of concern of regulatory oversight.'' 
   The New England Journal of Medicine editorialized against these legislative approaches to overturning Oregon's law out of concern for its impacts on pain management nationwide, saying: ``Many doctors are concerned about the scrutiny they invite when they prescribe or administer controlled substances and they are hypersensitive to `drug-seeking behavior' in patients. Patients, as well as doctors, often have exaggerated fears of addiction and the side effects of narcotics. Congress could make this bad situation worse.'' 
   It is worth noting that many people and organizations with expertise in pain management and palliative care are both opposed to physician assisted suicide and opposed to the Nickles-Hatch bill. There are over thirty organizations representing doctors, pharmacists, nurses, and patients who oppose the legislation, including: American Academy of Family Physicians; American Academy of Hospice and Palliative Medicine, American Academy of Pharmaceutical Physicians; American Geriatrics Society; American Nurses Association; American Pain Foundation; American Pharmaceutical Association; American Society for Action on Pain; American Society of Health-System Pharmacists; American Society of Pain Management Nurses; College on Problems of Drug Dependence; Hospice and Palliative Nurses Association; National Foundation for the Treatment of Pain; Oncology Nursing Society; Society of General Internal Medicine; Triumph over Pain Foundation; California Medical Association; Massachusetts Medical Society; North Carolina Medical Society; Oregon Medical Association; Rhode Island Medical Association; San Francisco Medical Society; Indiana State Hospice and Palliative Care Association; Hospice Federation of Massachusetts; Kansas Association of Hospices; Maine Hospice Council; Maine Consortium of Palliative Care and Hospice; Missouri Hospice and Palliative Care Association; New Hampshire State Hospice Organization; New Jersey Hospice and Palliative Care Organization; New York State Hospice Organization; and, Oregon Hospice Association. 
   Physician-assisted suicide is not a cry for help from people experiencing the failure of patents, copyrights and trademarks. Physician-assisted suicide is a cry for help from people who, in many cases, are experiencing a failure in the health system. And those failures occur across our nation; not just in Oregon. In one study reported in the August 12, 1998, issue of JAMA, over 15 percent of oncologists admitted to participating in physician-assisted suicide or euthanasia. The February 1997 New England Journal of Medicine published a report finding that 53 percent of physicians in a large, San Francisco-based AIDS treatment consortium admitted assisting in a suicide at least once. Personally, I am troubled and saddened that so many of our loved ones are so dissatisfied with their end-of-life options that they seek physician-assisted suicide, instead. 
   Whether or not this Congress decides to overturn Oregon's law, I believe it is critical that whatever we do must result in a reduced demand for physician-assisted suicide, not only in Oregon, but across our nation. Many reputable experts believe the ``Pain Relief Promotion Act'' will cause physicians--far beyond Oregon's borders--to provide less aggressive pain care to their suffering and dying patients. If this occurs, not only will millions of our elderly and dying constituents suffer needlessly, we may unwittingly increase the demand for suicide at the end of life. 
   I urge my colleagues, regardless of where they stand on the issue of Oregon's law, to join with me in supporting the restoration of the HELP Committee's jurisdiction. It would be unconscionable for the Senate to fail to correct an honest mistake that could contribute to a devastatingly significant change in health policy. With so much at stake, shouldn't we follow the regular order of the Senate? Shouldn't we insist that the Senate's best qualified health policy experts fully consider the complex policy implications before taking such an extraordinary risk for our constituents, our friends, and our families?

   Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I am introducing legislation today to help retain a unique environmental recycling program launched by Nike, a home-grown Oregon business, which involves recycling running shoes rather than dumping them in a landfill. The bill would resolve an issue on which the U.S. Customs Service has taken inherently conflicting positions: whether a duty drawback can be claimed on an item that has no commercial value and is no longer an item in United States commerce but which is recycled rather than destroyed. I believe recycling should be promoted and not punished, and that is what this legislation does. 
   Under existing U.S. Customs law, an importer is entitled to import duty drawback on products that are returned to the importer because they are defective. The point of this provision is to safeguard against an import duty being imposed on a product that does not end up in United States commerce. Customs law and regulation ensures that a product will not end up in U.S. commerce by requiring that the product be completely destroyed to the extent that the product has no commercial value, or that it be exported from the United States. In certain cases Customs has allowed duty drawback: for example, alcohol salvaged from destroyed beer and malt liquor which was sold as scrap rather than dumped as waste was accorded duty drawback. 
   Consistent with Customs' requirements, for a number of years Nike destroyed the shoes and placed them in a landfill. This amounted to thousands of tons of non-biodegradable shoes being dumped in landfills. Because shoes are not biodegradable, Nike developed a new, more environmentally-sustainable way to dispose of the defective shoes by chopping them into small pieces, called ``re-grind,'' and giving the regrind without charge or compensation to manufacturers of sport surfaces. The re-grind became part of playground, basketball and other surfaces that was used primarily for charitable purposes in poor urban centers around the country. The program, called the ``Re-Use A-Shoe,'' is one of the many initiatives Nike has undertaken to incorporate environmental sustainability into its operations. 
   The issue Customs has been grappling with is whether the re-grind is ``destroyed with no commercial value'' so as to qualify the destroyed shoes for duty drawback treatment. For several years Customs granted the re-grind shoes duty drawback, but a Customs audit team recently determined that the re-grind was not ``destroyed,'' as it had commercial value for court manufacturers and Customs recommended retroactive denial of Nike's drawback claims, totaling $11.6 million. Because Customs had already refunded the drawback, the audit team recommended that Nike repay the $11.6 million to Customs.  
   It is clear from Customs' decisions that an article is considered destroyed when it has been rendered of no commercial value and is no longer an article of commerce. In this case, the defective footwear, once shred, is valueless and of no commercial interest to anyone. Even when the shredded material is subsequently processed by Nike to recover some material of limited use, the recovered material is not saleable to anyone and therefore has no commercial value. 
   Mr. President, it seems to me that the position taken by the Customs audit team is not consistent with the intent of the duty drawback provision. There is no commercial value to Nike in the re-grind; the shoes have been destroyed. Nike gives the product to the manufacturer without charge or compensation, and the manufacturers have confirmed they would not pay for the material. I have copies of letters from each of the manufacturers attesting to the fact that they would not pay for the re-grind and that it is not commercially viable. It appears that the Customs audit team believes a more desirable outcome is to have Nike dump some 2 million pairs or 3.5 million pounds of shoes into a landfill rather than recycle the destroyed material. The outcome is the same: the shoes no longer have commercial value, nor are they a product in U.S. commerce. It would seem to me there is no public policy benefit in forcing Nike to dump the shoes in a landfill; but that there is much to be gained from recycling millions of pairs of shoes that would otherwise be dumped in a landfill.

    Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I am here today to introduce legislation that will allow a valuable member of the Portland, Oregon, community to become a permanent resident of the United States of America. Rose-Marie Barbeau-Quinn, a native of Canada, has lived in Portland since 1976. Together with her husband, Michael Quinn, she ran the Vat and Tonsure Tavern, a unique and popular restaurant that was a favorite of many of my constituents. 
   While Ms. Barbeau-Quinn and her husband, an American citizen, were together for over 16 years, their marriage did not take place until shortly before Michael's death in 1991. Since Rose-Marie and Michael were not formally married for the two years required by immigration law, and despite their 16 years together living as husband and wife, Rose-Marie has not been able to file for permanent residency in this country. 
   This legislation will correct their injustice, and allow Rose-Marie to be a permanent resident of the country she loves and has called home for over 20 years. I first learned of Ms. Barbeau-Quinn's situation from Senator Hatfield when I joined the Senate in 1996. Senator Hatfield championed her cause in the 104th Congress, and, as his request and the request of many of my constituents, I am attempting to complete the work that Senator Hatfield started. We both firmly believe that Rose-Marie would be a model United States resident. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, so that Rose-Marie Barbeau-Quinn can continue her place as a valuable member of our community for many years to come.

   Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, this morning there is fresh evidence that millions of our older Americans cannot afford their prescription medicine. I have come to the floor of this Senate on more than 20 occasions now to make this point. But the news this morning comes at an especially important time. On both sides of Capitol Hill efforts are underway to develop a practical approach to making sure older people can get prescription drug coverage under the Medicare program. 
   I have had the opportunity for many months now to work with colleagues on both sides of the aisle, and I am especially appreciative of the efforts of Senator DASCHLE to try to bring Members of the Senate together to find common ground in this session to get prescription drug coverage for older people. Under Senator DASCHLE's leadership, principles have been developed that every Member of the Senate would find appealing and attractive to. We have talked, for example, about how this program would be voluntary. No senior citizen who is comfortable with their prescription drug coverage would be required to do anything if they chose not to. That is something that would be attractive to both parties. 
   We have talked about making sure this is a market-oriented approach, that we use the kind of forces that are available to individuals receiving coverage in the private sector through private insurance and through health maintenance organizations. We want to make sure the benefit is available in all parts of the United States. There are areas of this country where there may not be big health plans, but as long as there is a telephone, a pharmacy, and a mailbox, we are going to be able to get the medicine to those older people in an affordable way. 
   Finally, many of my colleagues and I believe coverage ought to be universal. It ought to be available to all people on the Medicare program. 
   The most important point--and it is why I come to the floor today--is that we have fresh evidence that millions of seniors can't afford their medicine. We have to take steps to make the cost of medicine more affordable to the elderly. There is a right way to do this and a wrong way to do this. The wrong way is to institute a regime of private controls, a Federal one-size-fits-all approach because that involves a lot of cost shifting to other groups of citizens. 
   If we just have Federal price controls for the Medicare program, a lot of  women who are 27, single, with a couple of kids will see their prescription drug bill go through the roof. We will have to develop a market-oriented approach along the lines of what Members of Congress receive through the Federal Employees Health Benefits Plan. That way we can give senior citizens the kind of bargaining power that folks have in a health maintenance organization or in a private plan. We could do it without price controls that produce a lot of cost shifting. 
   This is an important date in the discussion about prescription drugs. Our older people don't get prescription drug coverage under the Medicare program. That has been the case since it began in 1965. When they walk into a pharmacy and don't have coverage, in effect, they are subsidizing the big buyers--the health maintenance organizations and the private plans. 
   I hope we can come together in the Senate to find common ground. Senator DASCHLE is trying to bring Members of the Senate together. I know there are colleagues on the other side of the aisle who feel exactly the same. Let's not let this issue go off as campaign fodder for the 2000 election. Let's not adjourn this session without coming together and enacting this important benefit for the elderly. 
   I don't believe America can afford not to cover prescription medicine. A lot of these drugs today might cost up to $1,000, such as an anticoagulant drug that is so important for the elderly. That is certainly a pricey sum. If a senior citizen can get anticoagulant medicine to prevent a stroke that would cost upwards of $100,000 or $150,000, it is pretty clear that prescription drug coverage is a sensible and cost-effective approach for the Senate to take. 
   I intend to return to the floor in the future, as I have done on more than 20 occasions, in an effort to bring the Senate together. I am especially appreciative of Senator DASCHLE's patience in our effort to try to find common ground. I know there are colleagues on the other side of the aisle who feel the same. 
   I yield the floor.

    Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, as a member of the Senate Diabetes Caucus, I am concerned with the need for further research for a cure for diabetes. Recently, I had several meetings with constituents from Portland, Eugene, and Lake Oswego, Oregon concerning diabetes research funding. All of these constituents are young children or young adults living with this disease. One young woman told me that she has already lost three friends to this disease. 
   For fiscal year 2000, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) received a $13.3 million increase over last year's funding for diabetes. This increase brings the total amount for diabetes research to $462.3 million. For those who have to live every day with diabetes and for those who are the parents of a child living with disease, and who have to worry every day about the long-term toll diabetes disease takes on their child, this is not enough. 
   Diabetes can destroy nerves, harm eyesight, and cause a host of other deleterious effects on the body. While I am pleased that there was an increase in the funding of NIH for diabetes research last year, I believe we can and should do more to assure that we find a cure. 
   While funding has increased from $134 million in fiscal year 1980, this only represents approximately 2 percent growth per year when adjusted for inflation. Considering the widespread and devastating effects of this disease, we should continue to support the funding increases for NIH research of diabetes. 
   I know that many of my colleagues feel strongly about this issue as well. I  hope we can work in a bipartisan manner to assure an increase in research funding to find a cure.

   Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, budgets aren't just about charts and graphs and cold figures on a sheet of paper. Budgets are about the hopes and aspirations of the American people and our core values. In my view, if the Senate passes the Robb amendment this morning, it will send a message to the 
   millions of senior citizens and families across this country that their hope of prescription drug coverage under Medicare is a priority for the Senate. 
   If the Senate passes the Robb amendment, it will be a chance to build on the progress that was made on the prescription drug issue in the Budget Committee. I particularly thank my colleagues, Senator SNOWE and Senator SMITH. In the Budget Committee, we were able to lock in a hard figure of $40 billion to start this prescription drug program. 
   Just as important, in the Budget Committee, there is a stipulation that if the Finance Committee doesn't act on the prescription drug issue on or about September 1 of this year, it is possible for any Member of this Senate, without points of order, to come directly to the floor. So we have been able to register our commitment behind the urgency of prescription drug coverage for older people. 
   The Robb amendment recognizes that the revolution in modern health care has bypassed the Medicare program. Every major private sector player in the health care field understands that pharmaceuticals are essential because they help to keep people well. Medicare Part A, on the other hand, will pay thousands of dollars for senior citizens' hospital bills, but Medicare Part B will not pay for outpatient prescription drug coverage to help older people stay well. 
   So that is why this is so important to the American people, and the Robb amendment says to all of those senior citizens who are breaking their pills in half because they can't afford their medicine or taking two pills when they ought to be taking three, who ought to be taking a drug such as Lipitor to deal with cholesterol and blood pressure and can't afford it, we have heard that, we understand how important this coverage is to older people. 
   If we pass the Robb amendment, it will not be possible for Members of this body to get to the end of the session and then say, gee, there just wasn't time to deal with this issue that is so important to seniors and families. 
   This amendment is critical to the hopes and aspirations of the American people. They are asking that prescription drug coverage be added to this program. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I will pick up briefly on the point made by the distinguished Senator from Illinois about moving forward with an agenda that meets the needs of the American people. 
   When we started this budget markup, the Senator from Texas, Mr. GRAMM, said the Senate ought to stand pat on the budget until after the election. In spite of the pressing health and education concerns of the American people, the concerns we will try to address on this floor this week, Senator GRAMM said we ought to stand pat; we should not take any significant steps with regard to action on many of these important issues in the health and education area. 
   I come to the floor this morning to say I am not prepared, and I think my colleagues are not prepared, to say to the millions of older people in this country and their families that we are going to stand pat given the huge problem they are facing with their prescription drug costs. I have come to the floor of the Senate more than 20 times in the last few months to talk about the older people who are supposed to take three pills a day and are taking only two; they are breaking up their anticholesterol capsules because they cannot afford the medicine. I am of the view this Nation can no longer afford to deny prescription drug coverage to the Nation's older people. 
   In my home State, we have older people being hospitalized in order to get prescription drug coverage because Part A of Medicare will pick up those bills and Part B, the outpatient part of the program, will not cover them. There has to be a sense of urgency about this important issue of prescription drug coverage for older people. I feel the same way, frankly, about education. 
   That is what we tried to do in the budget resolution. The chairman of the committee made a comment earlier with which I agree completely, questioning whether there could be comprehensive reform of the Medicare program this session. That is right. We ought to have comprehensive reform. 
   In the Budget Committee, at least as a beginning for significant reform, we said it is urgent to act this year. There is language that stipulates if the Finance Committee doesn't move on this issue by the fall, it is possible for any Member of the Senate to come to this floor and have the issue dealt with directly. We locked in the money to do the job right, $40 billion, which, by the way, is tied to reform of the program. We have language that talks about using marketplace principles and competitive purchasing techniques. It is a chance to finally get justice for older people and their families. 
   Medicare started off as half a loaf. It didn't cover prescription drugs in 1965. The big buyers--the health plans and HMO plans, the managed care plans--negotiate discounts. Democrats are having folks come to our townhall meetings, those people who are without prescription drug coverage--and only about a third of the older people do have good prescription drug coverage now. Those people in effect are subsidizing the big buyers. They are subsidizing the people in those health plans and the managed care organizations. 
   I think it is time to bring the revolution in private sector health care to the Medicare program. If we can get the anticoagulant drugs covered, which we want to do on this side of the aisle, we might spend $1,000 a year to help an older person with medicine but we will save $100,000 by being able to prevent the stroke an older person might otherwise incur. 
   We will try to convey a sense of urgency about this issue. I hope we will be able to get additional colleagues from the other side of the aisle to join. I particularly commend Senator SNOWE and Senator SMITH because they share our sense of urgency. They share our view we cannot just stand pat on this issue, as Senator GRAMM talked about in the Budget Committee. This country has now made it clear they want the Congress to act on this issue, and they want Congress to act now. They don't want it put off until after the election. We are going to try to convey that during this week's budget debate. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, the Robb amendment on prescription medicine tells senior citizens and families across this country that the Senate is listening to them. 
   This amendment tells those seniors and all of those families--and I have been contacted by more than 4,000--that getting prescription drug coverage for older people under Medicare is a priority of this Congress and a priority that has to be addressed now. Pass the Robb amendment and you don't get into a situation where, at the end of the session, somebody says, gee, there just wasn't enough time; we just weren't able to address that prescription drug issue; it's too bad, we will have to wait until the next Congress.  
   I think it is particularly important to pass the Robb amendment now because it builds on the important work, the important progress that was made in the Budget Committee. 
   I particularly commend my colleague from Oregon in the chair today, Senator SMITH, and also Senator SNOWE, for their courage. The two of them have worked with me and others for more than 15 months as a result of the concern of older people. We thought it was time to come together on a bipartisan basis and get this relief for older people now. 
   I have come to the floor more than 25 times in the last few months to describe the problem of seniors who are supposed to be taking three pills but they can only afford two. They are breaking their Lipitor capsules--the ones that help lower cholesterol and various blood pressure problems--in half because they can't afford their medicine. 
   So in the Budget Committee, as a result of the work of my colleague from Oregon, Senator SMITH, and Senator SNOWE, we have made a good bipartisan start. We locked in $40 billion to spend on prescription drugs, and we said there was a sense of urgency because the Senate Finance Committee ought to act on or before September 1, and if they didn't, it would be possible to come directly to the floor of the Senate and bring this issue up so that the American people could see who was on the side of covering prescription drugs for older people. 
   The older people, right now, get shellacked twice. Medicare isn't covering these important therapies. There is not a specialist in health care, Democrat or Republican, who would not offer this coverage if they were reinventing Medicare today. But in addition to not getting coverage, those older people and their families are subsidizing the big buyers. If you are in a small pharmacy in rural Oregon or rural Minnesota, or in another community across this country, in effect, if you don't have prescription drug coverage, you are out there subsidizing the big buyers, the health maintenance organizations and the health plans that do. 
   So the start we made in the Budget Committee by making sure there would be an adequate amount of money to put this program in place, to make sure we had a timetable to get the job done, so that Congress could not duck this issue and would have to see action by the Finance Committee or face the prospect early this fall of dealing with it on the floor of the Senate--that progress in the Budget Committee is something we would build on with the Robb amendment. 
   The Robb amendment makes it very clear that Congress cannot duck this issue, and budgets are about more than numbers; they are about more than charts and graphs and cold figures. The 
   Robb amendment reflects the hopes and aspirations of our seniors and our working families--the ones my colleague and friend, Senator SMITH, and I have met at townhall meetings who came to us and told us, as so many seniors have said to me: I cannot make ends meet. My Social Security went up by only a little bit, and my prescription drug bill went up hundreds of dollars during that period of time. 
   The Robb amendment says that we have been listening to those older people; that we understand this issue is a priority for them, this issue is so important that Congress is not going to go home until it has been addressed. I was very proud of what was done in the Budget Committee. I think my colleague from Oregon and Senator SNOWE, because of the many discussions we had, were under a tremendous amount of pressure when that discussion came up because it was a very tense moment. 
   I think my colleague from Oregon said it well, and the Robb amendment reflects this also: This is time to be on the right side of history. This is time to revolutionize American health care. In effect, the revolution in American health care has bypassed the Medicare program. These medicines today help older people stay well. They help folks lower their blood pressure and cholesterol. Now we have a chance, using competitive marketplace principles, to come together and put this program in place. 
   Senator DASCHLE has emphasized in talking to me on almost a daily basis how he wants to bring the Senate together on this issue. The chairman of the Budget Committee was very patient in working with us as we tried to deal with this issue in committee. The Robb amendment compliments those efforts, builds on those efforts by making it clear that Congress should not leave for this session until we have put this important program in place. 
   For the older people of this country who average 18 prescriptions a year, 20 percent of whom spend over $1,000 a year out-of-pocket on their medicines, when they see the Robb amendment get passed by the Senate, they will say, finally, Congress is listening to us. My friend and colleague from Oregon and I have had the experience where seniors brought their bills to us at these sessions. When we pass the Robb amendment, we will make it clear to those seniors and working families that we have heard them. There is not a specialist in the health care field, Democrat or Republican, who now doesn't believe that prescription drugs ought to be part of this program. This is a chance to revolutionize American health care, to concentrate on keeping people well. 
   Just one brief example: If we can get anticoagulant medicines covered for older people, which is something the Robb amendment would make possible, it might cost $1,000 a year for seniors to get help with that medicine, and we could end up saving $100,000 in costs incurred by Part A of Medicare, the hospital program, when an older person suffers a stroke because they could not get their medicine on an outpatient basis. 
   I am going to wrap up by describing what really brought this problem home to me and my friend from Oregon, Senator SMITH. We have been to Hillsboro in our State many times. 
   Recently, I got a letter from a physician in Hillsboro who told me he had to put a senior citizen in a hospital for 6 weeks because that older person could not afford their medicine on an outpatient basis. When the physician in Hillsboro, in our home State, put the older person in the hospital, they were able to get help under Part A of Medicare, the hospital portion of the program. But the Government could have saved money with the effort that is behind the Robb amendment and what we tried to start in the Budget Committee. We could have gotten help for that senior in Hillsboro, OR, in a most cost-effective way, more quickly, and in a way that would have left the older person more comfortable because they would have been in the community rather than in a hospital. 
   So I only ask, as we continue this debate--and I gather it will go into tomorrow--that we focus on building on the progress that was made in the Budget Committee, to a great extent because two of my colleagues, Senator SNOWE and Senator SMITH, showed real courage in working with us. If we pass the Robb amendment, we build on that important progress and again demonstrate to the older people and the working families of this country we are listening to them. 
   With that, I yield the floor.

   Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to talk about a very encouraging development and solution with respect to prescription drugs. 
   I have come to the floor on more than 20 separate occasions over the last several months to talk particularly about how America can no longer afford to deny this critical coverage. Again and again, I cited examples on the floor of this Senate about how our country cannot afford to deny seniors the opportunity to get prescription drug coverage. I have talked, for example, about the exciting anticoagulant drugs. These drugs allow a senior citizen, for example, for perhaps $1,000 or $1,500, to prevent a stroke which might end up costing more than $100,000. 
   What is so exciting about these prescription medicines is that they don't just help older people when they are very ill, but they are absolutely key to keeping older people healthy by lowering blood pressure and cholesterol. They will help senior citizens stay in the community and will keep them from racking up those much larger health care expenses under what is known as Part A of the Medicare Hospital Insurance Trust Fund. 
   Again and again, we have seen examples of how cholesterol-lowering drugs can reduce death and expenses for senior citizens. 
   For example, heart disease is the leading cause of death for persons 65 and older. Beta blockers can reduce long-term mortality by 25 percent, and they cost about $360 a year, or $30 a month. 
   One in five older women has osteoporosis. About 15 percent have suffered fractures as a result this disease. This disease is the leading risk factor for hip fractures. Estrogen replacement can reduce the risk of osteoporosis as well as cardiovascular disease. One commonly used drug costs $20 a month. This is an investment that can help avoid those hip fractures and help avoid the extraordinary medical expenses. 
   I must say that my own mother, who will be 80 years of age very shortly, had a hip fracture recently, and this drove home to me how these prescription medicines can help avoid the kinds of health problems that my mother and scores of others seniors have seen, and how providing coverage now is an investment this Senate cannot afford to pass up. 
   What was exciting about the developments in the budget resolution was, first, that the Budget Committee committed $40 billion would be committed for this important program. For example, on the other side of the Capitol, the House of Representatives talked about $40 billion, but they could spend it on just about anything in the health care arena. The Senate Budget Committee said we are going to make $40 billion available for prescription drugs because it is high time we set in place this important coverage. 
   Second, we provided a date certain to get this job done. Our colleague from Louisiana, Senator BREAUX, has been correct to say repeatedly that the Senate Finance Committee has now held 14 hearings on this issue. Clearly there is great interest in that committee in moving forward. 
   The budget resolution says on this point that if the Senate Finance Committee does not come forward with a prescription drug benefit on or before September 1st of this year, any Member of the Senate can come to the floor of this body and bring this issue before the Senate. 
   The Presiding Officer of the Senate, who serves with me on the Senate Committee on Aging, could come to the floor if he had a plan to deal with prescription drugs. Senator SNOWE and I have teamed up on a bipartisan basis. We are particularly grateful for the help of Senator GORDON SMITH last week in the Budget Committee. The resolution allows any group of Senators to come forward with 
   legislation if the Senate Finance Committee does not report a prescription drug measure on or before September 1st of this year. 
   I think it is critical to note that many Senators in the leadership of both political parties were involved in this effort. 
   Senator DASCHLE has talked to me almost daily about the importance of the Senate dealing with this issue, and dealing with it this year. He has worked very hard to try to reconcile the various approaches Senators have on this issue. He also has been steadfast in saying how important it is that the Senate not put this off until after another election. 
   There may be some colleagues on the Republican side and some on the Democratic side who will say: Let's just talk about this in the political campaign. 
   I believe we can't afford to deny this coverage to the Nation's senior citizens.  
   Senator DASCHLE has been resolute in saying we ought to go forward and deal with this issue, and deal with it in this session of Congress. 
   I also want to commend several of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle: Senator DOMENICI, for example, in the Budget Committee, when this issue got to a flash point; it would have been very difficult even to go forward. Senator DOMENICI worked with several of us, particularly Senator SNOWE and Senator SMITH, in order to bring the committee together on this point. We had some bipartisan support last week in the Budget Committee for taking tangible action on this issue. 
   What is really important is that every Senator understands that I and others are going to stay at this issue again and again and again so the Senate does not miss this historic opportunity. 
   Too often, whether dating back to catastrophic health care legislation or the failed efforts in 1993 and 1994 to pass comprehensive health care reform, we have muffed. The Congress has muffed the opportunity to put in place a historic breakthrough in terms of health care in our country. I think we have another such opportunity as a result of the work that was done in the Budget Committee last week. 
   Only about one in four of our senior citizens has prescription drug coverage. Many of them take up to 20 medicines a year. Something like 20 percent of the Nation's senior citizens spend over $1,000 out of pocket now on their prescription medicines. As a result of these and other factors, there is not a single specialist in the health care field and not a Democrat or a Republican who would create a Medicare program today without including prescription drug coverage. 
   That is why the breakthrough we saw in the Budget Committee last week is so important. I think it is absolutely critical that we keep what was done in the Budget Committee throughout this process. It may be challenged on the floor of the Senate this week. My understanding is that there will be Senators opposed to it, but I think we can build on the work that was done last week in the Budget Committee. Again, I commend Chairman DOMENICI, Senator SNOWE, and Senator GORDON SMITH, my colleague from Oregon, for working with us on it--we can get this done; we can ensure that action on prescription drugs is tied to reform of the Medicare program. 
   Many of my colleagues have stressed this. I think they are right. I, too, happen to believe it would be better to have comprehensive Medicare reform that includes prescription drug coverage. 
   I think it is also clear--and I stress this because it is so important to this Senator and many on this side of the aisle--that we cannot afford to wait. We want to use competitive purchasing principles for prescription drug benefit. We will use the kind of principles that make sense in private sector health care. We will ensure the benefit is voluntary. No senior would have to choose this particular benefit if they preferred their existing coverage. However, we do want to put in place a universal coverage program. We want to get it done before this Congress adjourns. 
   We are going to fight with all our strength to protect what was done in the Budget Committee last week on the floor of the Senate this week and when it goes to conference and throughout the process so that if the Senate Finance Committee does not act to provide this benefit on or before September 1 of this year, that any Member of this body will be able, without facing points of order, come to the floor of the Senate and force the Senate to deal with this critical issue. 
   I am sure when my colleagues go home and talk to constituents they will find what I have found; that is, the question of prescription drug coverage is one of the two or three most pressing issues our constituents care about. 
   We have families and older people all across this country who are walking on an economic tightrope balancing their food bills against their fuel bills and their fuel bills against their medical costs. 
   I have been bringing to the floor of the Senate cases of older people who are supposed to take three pills and they take only two. They are breaking their lipid-lowering capsules in half--the drugs that help to deal with cholesterol and heart problems--because they cannot afford to take the full pill. 
   I spoke recently about a case from Hillsboro, OR, my home State. A physician actually put an elder person in a hospital for 6 weeks because that elderly man could not afford the medicine on an outpatient basis. Allowing outpatient coverage of medicine is what we are trying to accomplish in the Senate. Seniors could get their medicine without going into the hospital. That older gentleman in Hillsboro, OR, had to be hospitalized for 6 weeks so he could get his medicine paid for under what is known as Part A of the Medicare program. That is a classic example of how, under today's health care system, dollars are wasted by having a person hospitalized rather than getting help in the community and, at the same time, facing the predicament of taking longer to get healthy than if these benefits have been available more promptly on an outpatient basis for the elderly. 
   Last week's developments in the Budget Committee were encouraging. Many predicted the Budget Committee would not adopt binding language with respect to prescription drugs that would allow the Senate to get this program enacted, and get it enacted this year. However, the Budget Committee came together. I commend my colleagues, Senator SNOWE and Senator GORDON SMITH. They have worked with me for 15 months. We now have funding available in the budget resolution. We have a date certain when it can actually come before the Senate. If the Finance Committee doesn't act on or before September 1, any Senator could bring this issue to the floor of the Senate and it would be tied to the question of Medicare reform. 
   There is a long way to go. We have to get through the discussion this week. Then we will have a conference committee. Then many Members will work closely with the Finance Committee where there are many interested Senators who have devoted time to this prescription drug issue. 
   What was done in the Budget Committee last week was something of a breakthrough. It was a very encouraging development for the millions of seniors and families who are watching how Congress deals with this issue, watching to make sure we do it this year, do it on a bipartisan basis, and not just send it out to be another topic and cannon fodder for the political campaign this fall. 
   As I have made clear, I intend to keep coming back to the floor again and again raising examples of why this Nation cannot afford to deny prescription drug coverage for the elderly. More than 4,000 seniors from Oregon have written me since I have begun this effort. The cases illustrate in a dramatic way how important it is that Congress deal with this issue now. 
   I intend, with my colleagues, to come back again and again and again until we get this coverage for the Nation's older people. This country can no longer afford to have the Congress deny this coverage. With the work done in the Budget Committee, we have an opportunity now to deal with this issue promptly. The seniors who come to our town hall meetings with their prescription drug bills tell how their private insurance doesn't cover their prescriptions. Because they cannot afford prescription medicine, very often they get sicker. They are the ones who have a right to expect this Congress to act. 
   The developments last week for the first time give me a tangible sense that we are going to be able to get this done. It was concrete evidence that the Congress understands how important this issue is. Many of my colleagues have said this is one of their top two priorities for this session of Congress. Certainly it is for this Senator. We are going to keep coming back to this floor, stressing the need for action on their prescriptions until the Senate moves to do what should have been done years ago. 
   When Medicare was enacted in 1965, it did not cover prescription drugs. Now the big buyers, the health maintenance organizations and the health plans, are able to negotiate discounts. That means senior citizens in Alabama, Oregon, and across the country pay more for their medicine because they are not able to get the benefits of the big buyers. Seniors are going to have the power of the big buyers if we can act this session. A number of the key  bills before the Senate give older people bargaining power in the marketplace in order to be able to afford their medicine. That is key--affordability--the ability of senior citizens to afford their prescription medicine so they don't have to give up food, rent, and heat. 
   Making drugs affordable for seniors has been important to all Members who have focused on this issue. Yet there are many seniors who struggle to make ends meet because they cannot get medicine in an affordable way. The budget resolution provides the opportunity now for those seniors to get relief. I will do everything in my power, and there are many of my colleagues who will, as well, to defend what was done in the Budget Committee last week on prescription drugs throughout this process. If we have a floor fight on this measure, those who try to knock out what the Budget Committee did ought to understand how strong Members feel who worked to get that prescription drug coverage in the budget resolution. I hope we will not see that kind of fight. 
   I hope the work done by Senator SNOWE and Senator SMITH, along with Senator DASCHLE, Senator CONRAD, and myself, the group of Members who worked with the Budget Committee, can be preserved. 
   It ought to be preserved for the Nation's senior citizens. Those are the people who are counting on us to deliver on this critical issue. I intend to keep coming back to this floor again and again and again until we have achieved this major health care reform that the older people of this country richly deserve. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, over the last 3 months I have come to the floor of the Senate on more than 20 occasions to talk about the need to assist the Nation's senior citizens and families under Medicare with help with the extraordinary costs so many of them are experiencing for prescription medicine. I am very pleased to report some very exciting, positive developments that have taken place in the last few hours on this issue as a result of the bipartisan effort in the Budget Committee. 
   I particularly want to commend my colleagues Senators SNOWE and SMITH. Senators SNOWE and SMITH have teamed up with me on a bipartisan basis for more than 15 months to address this enormous need of the Nation's older people. 
   Today in the Budget Committee we took a concrete, tangible step to set in place the kind of program that really will provide meaningful relief for the Nation's older people. We did it in a way that will be consistent with long-term Medicare reform, a view that is a view shared by Members on both sides of the aisle. It allows for universal coverage and a program that is voluntary. That is to ensure that older people can make the choices that are good for them. 
   Specifically, what the Budget Committee did is provide legislation that would allocate $20 billion during the next 3 years to put in place a prescription drug program, and then make it possible to add another $20 billion in the next fiscal year, which would be fiscal year 2004-2005, as part of an effort to ensure solvency, long-term Medicare reform, and to do it in a way that would not cause an on-budget deficit in those later years. 
   I have believed for a long time that at a time when more than 20 percent of our Nation's older people are spending over $1,000 a year out of pocket on their prescription medicine, when we have millions of seniors with an average of 18 prescriptions a year, that it is important we put in place, on a bipartisan basis, meaningful relief for the Nation's older people. 
   Today, on a bipartisan basis, the Budget Committee said the Finance Committee should report a plan on or before September 1 of this year to help older people with their prescription drug medicine to ensure that $20 billion would be available for fiscal years 2001, 2002, and 2003, and, accompanied by real reform of the Medicare Program, there could be $20 billion for fiscal years 2004 and 2005. 
   This required, frankly, compromise on both sides. For example, one of the stipulations in what was done by the Budget Committee today was a stipulation that there could not be transfers of new subsidies from the general fund to extend solvency. Frankly, some of my colleagues on the Democratic side of the aisle had supported those kinds of transfers in the past. 
   I think after many months of debate, and certainly a lot of prognosticators saying it was not possible in this session of Congress to make real headway on the prescription drug issue, and, in fact, to get the job done, what the Senate Budget Committee showed this morning in a very significant breakthrough is that we are now on our way to address the needs of older people. In fact, this language would be binding. The language adopted by the Budget Committee, setting out the parameters for the adoption of a prescription drug program for the Nation's elderly under Medicare, would be binding. 
   In addition to my two colleagues Senators SNOWE and SMITH, I would like to single out a number of others on a bipartisan basis 
   who helped us. Chairman DOMENICI, for example, was one who, in many conversations with me on this issue, talked about the need to make this program consistent with long-term Medicare reform and to make Medicare more solvent in the future. That is an issue that has been highlighted by Senators DASCHLE, LAUTENBERG, and CONRAD as well. But the fact that Senator DOMENICI emphasized that in the last couple of days helped us find common ground this morning. 
   This is a vast improvement on what the House has thus far been able to accomplish on this issue of prescription drugs. Specifically, the Senate made it clear we could launch a prescription drug program that would offer $40 billion of assistance to the Nation's older people, a program that would assist all senior citizens. So the Senate was able, this morning, in the Budget Committee, on a bipartisan basis, to add a significant amount of additional relief. That was important. 
   The House did not address the solvency issue and that is what, in fact, the Senate did. In that sense it is a dramatic improvement. What we did, in terms of the dollars on a bipartisan basis, is today we raised the amount the Senate would make available for the program to $40 billion. Originally that amount was $20 billion. 
   The fundamental point remains. We addressed this issue by adding more money than was originally envisaged in the mark that came out from the Senate. We were able to do it in a way that addressed the Medicare solvency question. The House did not really touch the Medicare solvency question, and we think, on a bipartisan basis in the Senate this morning, that was important. 
   Finally, we know the revolution in American health care has essentially bypassed the Medicare Program. A lot of these medicines today help older people to stay well. They help to lower blood pressure. They help to lower cholesterol. They are medicines that promote wellness. They do not just take care of folks when they are sick. As a result of the work done today, we made a major step forward in modernizing this program and bringing it in line with the rest of the American health care system. 
   I reported on the floor of the Senate recently a case of an older person in Hillsboro, OR, who had to be hospitalized for 6 weeks because Part A of Medicare would pay his prescription drug bill and he could not afford his medicine on an outpatient basis. Today, as a result of what the Senate Budget Committee did, that person will be in a position to get his medicine on an outpatient basis. 
   They will be able to get help because the Senate improved on what the House has been talking about by putting more of a focus on solvency, and  we were able to take the amount of the program up to $40 billion beyond what the original discussion had been in the Senate, just $20 billion. 
   Finally, we need to understand there is a long way to go from here. We are going to have to defend what was done by the Senate Budget Committee this morning on the floor of the Senate. Then we will have a conference with the House. I hope we will come out of that discussion with the House ensuring there is $40 billion for the prescription drug program, that it is possible to have universal coverage, that it is voluntary, that it is consistent with Medicare reform, and that it gives older people bargaining power in the private sector to get more affordable medicine. 
   There is a long way to go in the process. This morning's breakthrough was just one step in the process. It was a chance to go forward in a way that is fiscally responsible--$20 billion for the first 3 years to as the first downpayment, as Senator SNOWE has characterized it, on prescription drug relief, but then also to say there will be another $20 billion available in 2004 and 2005 when it is accompanied by reform. 
   We also work to ensure solvency, and for the first time, we put real time constraints on getting a prescription drug benefit done . 
   As was pointed out yesterday in the Senate Finance Committee by Senator BREAUX, there have been 14 hearings on the issue of Medicare reform and prescription drug coverage for older people. Senator BREAUX, along with Senator FRIST, has a bipartisan bill supported by a number of Members of the Senate. 
   What we said this morning in the Budget Committee is that we want the Finance Committee, on or before September 1 of this year, to bring us legislation in line with the binding language offered in the Senate Budget Committee under the Snowe-Wyden-Smith amendment. 
   Having come to the floor of the Senate on more than 20 occasions, as I related those stories about older people who had been put in hospitals because they could not afford their medicine on an outpatient basis, older people who were taking two pills a day when they should have been taking three, or breaking their Lipitor capsules--which deals with cholesterol and heart problems--in half, I often thought as I left the floor that we might not be able to make the kind of progress we made today in the Budget Committee. 
   Today, the Budget Committee came together on a bipartisan basis to ensure there would be sufficient funds to jump-start Medicare reform, provide meaningful relief for the Nation's older people and their families, while addressing the solvency question and the need for an approach to be consistent with long-term Medicare reform. 
   We have improved on what is being discussed in the House because they do not have the same focus on solvency. I am very much looking forward--as we bring that legislation to the floor of the Senate and it goes to conference and the work in the Finance Committee--to continue the progress we saw this morning. 
   Suffice it to say, there were a number of moments today when it was likely that it was all going to break down. Had the Budget Committee reported a significantly smaller sum than was finally agreed on, had we not made the kind of changes in the Snowe-Wyden-Smith amendment, we might not have been able to reach a bipartisan agreement on prescription drugs this year in the Congress. As a result of what happened today in the Budget Committee and the important work that was done on a bipartisan basis, we have laid the foundation for making sure that before this Congress adjourns and goes home for the year, we have acted to help the Nation's older people. 
   For all of those seniors and for all the families who are walking an economic tightrope, balancing their food costs against their fuel bills and their fuel bills against their medical bills, my admonition this afternoon is that we have a long way to go, but today we really made progress. 
   Today, as a result of bipartisan work, we have an opportunity to ensure that by fall, on or before September 1, as the amendment adopted in the Budget Committee requires, we have a proposal that is bipartisan, that is one which provides meaningful relief for older people, that is voluntary, offers universal coverage, and is consistent with long-term Medicare reform. We can have that kind of proposal on the floor of the Senate this fall. 
   For the millions of seniors and families who are watching the Congress and looking to see if we can deliver on this issue, progress was made today. I particularly commend Senator SNOWE and Senator SMITH. Senator SMITH made a very constructive suggestion towards the end of the markup when we had a debate about when the Budget Committee was seeking a product from the Finance Committee. Senator SMITH offered a very constructive suggestion. If we can continue to build on that bipartisan progress, we can get this job done. 
   I believe--and I will wrap up with this--this country can no longer afford to deny coverage for senior citizens' prescription needs under Medicare. I use those words deliberately. People ask if we can afford to offer the coverage. I am of the view that we cannot afford not to offer this coverage because the revolution in American health care is about these new medicines that help people stay well. 
   I have pointed out repeatedly that one can spend $1,000 or $1,500 on anticoagulant medicines that help prevent strokes and can stop a stroke that costs more than $100,000. 
   Today, we made very significant progress in ensuring that no longer does the revolution in American health care bypass the Medicare program. I look forward to defending what was done in the Budget Committee on prescription drugs on the floor of the Senate when we get to the budget and working with the Finance Committee. Senators MOYNIHAN and ROTH have been very gracious in assuring there will be an opportunity for colleagues in both parties to contribute and offer their ideas and suggestions. 
   If we can continue to build on the progress that was made today in the Budget Committee, we will get this done, and we will get it done before the end of this session. In my view, this will revolutionize American health care and provide meaningful relief to older people and their families. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.

    Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I am introducing today the Wireless Eavesdropping Protection Act. This bill will enhance the privacy rights of wireless subscribers by strengthening the laws that prohibit eavesdropping wireless communications. Since the early days of wireless communications, Congress has paid particular attention to the privacy rights of wireless subscribers. Unfortunately, despite our best efforts, electronic eavesdroppers have been able to find loopholes in the law. I am pleased to be joined in this effort by the Senator from Montana, Senator BURNS. 
   Using the loopholes, electronic eavesdroppers have been able to develop a ``gray market'' for modified and modifiable wireless scanners. Some of these individuals even advertise in magazines and on Internet websites that their products can be altered easily to pick up cellular communications. The information and equipment necessary to make these modifications are also widely advertised, sometimes with blatant offers to unblock the cellular frequencies after the equipment is purchased. 
   The Wireless Eavesdropping Protection Act attacks these problems on several fronts. First, it would expand the definition of the frequencies that may not be scanned to include digital Personal Communications Service (PCS) frequencies as well as cellular ones. The legislation recognizes that some frequencies are shared between commercial mobile services and public safety users, and that the use of scanners to monitor public safety communications may assist in saving lives. As to those frequencies, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) may adopt such regulations as may be necessary to enhance privacy. 
   Second, the bill would clarify that it is just as illegal to modify scanners for the purpose of eavesdropping as it is to manufacture or import them for this purpose, and it would direct the FCC to modify its rules to reflect this change. The bill also would amend current law to prohibit either the intentional interception or the intentional divulgence of wireless communications, so that either action on its own would be prohibited. Finally, the bill would require the FCC to investigate and take action on wireless privacy violations, regardless of any other investigative or enforcement action by any other federal agency. This provision would help ensure that these newly strengthened privacy protections are full enforced in the future.

   Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, for the last 3 months I have come to the floor of the Senate on more than 20 occasions to talk about the need for this Congress to pass legislation that would cover senior citizens' prescription drug needs under Medicare. I have said again and again that this country can no longer afford not to cover prescription drugs. 
   Before we broke for the work period at home, I talked about a case, for example, from Hillsboro, OR, of a senior citizen who had to be placed in a hospital for more than 6 weeks because he could not afford his medicine on an outpatient basis. Just think about that wasted money. The older person could not get help on an outpatient basis for his medicine, and the doctor said we have no choice but to put that person with a leg infection in the hospital so he can get prescription drug coverage under Part A of the Medicare program. 
   Today, I brought with me a letter from an elderly woman in Phoenix, OR. She receives $1,100 per month in Social Security. Her prescription drug bills run $1,000 a month. She is 74 years old, and she wrote me: What can you do to help? 
   I think it would be a tragedy for this Congress to not go forward on a bipartisan basis and enact meaningful relief for the Nation's older people who are getting clobbered with these prescription drug bills. Again and again, we are hearing from seniors in these instances where they have been hospitalized because they could not afford their medicine on an outpatient basis, where when they are done paying for their prescription drugs for the month, they have only a couple hundred dollars left to pay for food, heat, and housing. In a country as strong and prosperous as ours, we can't allow this kind of tragedy to continue. I think it is absolutely critical that this be addressed on a bipartisan basis. 
   For many months now, I have teamed up with the Senator from Maine, Ms. SNOWE, on a bipartisan bill. We use marketplace forces to ensure that older people have bargaining power in the private sector to be in a better position to afford their medicine. Right now, these HMOs get big discounts; they have lots of clout in the marketplace--HMOs and the private sector plans. If you are an older person who walks into a local pharmacy, you in effect have to subsidize those big buyers. You get shellacked twice. Medicare doesn't cover prescription medicine and, in effect, in the marketplace you subsidize the people with clout. 
   The Snowe-Wyden legislation uses private sector bargaining power, along the lines of what we have in the Congress with the Federal Employees  Health Benefits system, so that the dollars seniors use for private health insurance are pooled, and they have real negotiating power so they are in a position to get more reasonable prices for their medicine. 
   Some have said we ought to just put the Government in charge of this, sort of have rate regulation. Well, I think that would be a big mistake. The biggest concern I have about that approach is it would cause a lot of cost shifting. You could have the Government be the big kid on the block and drive the system through the Health Care Financing Administration, but you would put all the costs onto somebody who is 27 or 28 and is 
   working hard trying to get ahead, and their prescription drug bill would have gone up because the Congress didn't address this Medicare issue in the right way. 
   Fortunately--and I think he deserves enormous credit--Senator DASCHLE has been working to try to reconcile the various approaches. He has talked with me about this issue, almost on a daily basis, in an effort to try to have the Senate come together and enact meaningful relief. He stakes out principles that I think can be supported on both sides of the aisle--principles such as making sure the program is voluntary, that no senior citizen be required to do anything; if they wanted to keep their current coverage, they would be allowed to do that. We want to make sure the action we take on prescription drugs is consistent with long-term Medicare reform. I think the approach I have advocated, in terms of creating more choices and more options in the marketplace, is consistent with responsible Medicare reform. 
   We have talked about bargaining power in the private sector, the way the responsible private insurance companies have acted. I think that is something that will attract Members on both sides of the aisle. I think Senator DASCHLE is absolutely right in terms of trying to bring the Senate together to find the common ground and pass meaningful legislation. 
   We will have a chance this week to make the first significant step in the Senate toward passing this legislation. As the Budget Committee meets--and I sit on the Budget Committee, and Senator SNOWE sits on the Budget Committee--we will have a chance to ensure that in this budget, which is not just facts and figures but, really, the hopes and aspirations of the American people--we, in effect, set aside the funds needed to go forward and enact a meaningful prescription drug program for the Nation's older people. 
   I don't want to see this Congress adjourn without making this important addition to the Medicare program. There is not a single expert in the health field--Democrat or Republican--who doesn't believe that if you designed the Medicare program from scratch today, you would not cover prescription drugs. They all think it is something that is essential to meaningful Medicare reform. I intend to keep coming back to this floor again and again and again throughout this session of the Congress to talk about prescription medicine. 
   For about 7 years, before I had the honor of being elected to the other body, I was director of the Gray Panthers at home. We believed that prescription drug coverage in Medicare was important then. But, frankly, it is vastly more important now because the drugs of this century essentially aren't just drugs that, as we saw back then, are primarily to help people when they are sick; the new drugs are absolutely key to helping folks to stay well. They help folks to lower blood pressure and cholesterol. It is a way to hold down Medicare costs. Because of the result of folks being able to stay healthy, they don't land in the hospital and incur enormous costs that are engendered by Part A of the Medicare program. 
   I am going to keep coming to the floor of this body to talk about the need for bipartisan action on prescription drugs, to urge the Senate to follow the counsel of Senator DASCHLE. I know Senator SNOWE and others on the other side of the aisle are interested in finding common ground. I am going to keep urging that we work on this issue and not adjourn this session of Congress until we have provided this relief to the Nation's older people. I come again with a whole sheaf of cases of older people who are writing and asking what we can do to help. They are asking Congress to act this year, not put this off until after the election and use it as a political football again. 
   I think we owe it to the Nation's older people and their families to address this issue, as Senator DASCHLE suggests, in this Congress; that we come together as Members of the Senate to make this improvement to the Medicare program that is long overdue. I intend to keep coming back to the floor of this body again and again and again reading these direct and very poignant accounts about why this coverage is so important until we get this legislation enacted. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, many working Americans fell like they've been left on the sidelines in the high-stakes game of international trade. As U.S. companies expand overseas, corporate profits soar. Workers standby watching for some tangible benefits for their own pocketbooks. A May 1999 Los Angeles Times story captured Americans' skepticism toward trade. The story found just over half the public in March 1994 believed that treaties such as NAFTA would create U.S. jobs, with only 32% fearing jobs loss. But by December 1998, the attitudes had flip-flopped. A Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll found that 58% of Americans believed that trade had reduced U.S. jobs and wages. 
   Nowhere has Americans' growing alienation from the world trading system been more evident than at the November 1999 World Trade Organization (WTO) Ministerial meeting. The nightly news was filled with the pictures of workers protesting the WTO in the streets of Seattle. This sense of alienation will continue to grow unless workers themselves start to see more direct benefits from trade. 
   The legislation I am pleased to introduce today with Senator BAUCUS is an effort to narrow America's dividend divide in world trade. Our bill, The Working Families Trade Bonus Act, says  that when companies win from world trade, workers should win, too. The bill would do this by encouraging companies to give their workers added Trade Bonus stock options--which workers at Fortune magazine's top 100 U.S. companies identified as one of the key reasons they work for the company. And for the millions of working Americans who don't have stock plans--farmers, self-employed and small business people--the bill would allow them to double the maximum allowable annual IRA contribution. 
   The bill specifically targets workers who are often excluded by company stock option plans--those at the lower end of company pay scales. The Trade Bonus program prohibits a company from discriminating in favor of highly compensated employees and requires that all employees be allowed to purchase the maximum amount of stock allowed by law at the lowest price allowed by law. The program would not allow companies to substitute stock options for regular compensation. Together, these safeguards assure that all workers are included in the trade winner's circle. 
   Proponents of free trade, like Senator BAUCUS and myself, have done a lot of talking about its benefits. Manufactured goods are the centerpiece of our nation's export--accounting for nearly two-thirds of total U.S. exports of goods and services. Exports support about one in every five American factory jobs. These jobs pay about 15 percent more on average than non-export-related jobs, require more skills and are less prone to economic downturns than those accounted for fully one-third of our nation's economic growth, and since 
   1950, international trade flows have grown twice as fast as the economy. Yet, most workers have few good things to say about free trade because they've never seen any direct benefits from it. It's time to turn the rhetoric about free trade into real benefits for workers. It's time to widen the winner's circle to make sure that American workers share directly in the rewards of free trade. 
   Our legislation would require the Secretary of Commerce to determine annually, beginning with 1998, whether international trade has contributed to an increase in U.S. GDP. This determination would be included in the President's budget for the subsequent fiscal year. For every year in which the Secretary makes a determination that trade has contributed to an increase in the U.S. GDP, employers would be encouraged to contribute additional compensation up to $2,000 per worker per year to employee stock purchase plans. These additional contributions to an employee's stock purchase plan--the Trade Bonus--would not be subject to capital gains tax. For workers who are not eligible for an employee stock purchase plan Trade Bonus, the bill allows them to double the allowable annual amount of their IRA contribution--to a maximum of $4,000. 
   For employers with 100 or fewer employees that do not have employee stock purchase plans, the bill would give them a significant incentive to create them; the bill offers a one-time tax credit to help offset all the administrative fees directly related to establishing an employee stock purchase plan. It would also provide limited tax credits for three subsequent years for costs directly related to IRS compliance and employee education about the Trade Bonus program. The language of this section is drawn from previous legislation and assures that the tax credit applies only to the actual cost of creating the employee stock purchase plan and not to services that may be related to retirement planning, such as tax preparation, accounting, legal or brokerage services. 
   The bill sets out guidelines for employers establishing or expanding an employee stock purchase plan under the Trade Bonus program, including that employees be eligible for the maximum amount of $2,000 at the lowest price allowed by law; that employers make the plan available to the widest range of employees without discrimination in favor of highly compensated employees; that employers ensure that the trade bonus is in addition to compensation an employee would normally receive (and that safeguards be in place to do so); and that it does not result in lack of diversification of an employee's assets. 
   Here's how the Working Families Trade Bonus Act would work. As under current law, employee stock purchase plans offer stock to participants at a discount. The current minimum purchase price is the lesser of 85% of the value of the stock on the date of the grant of the options (usually the beginning of the purchase period) or 85% of the value of the stock when the option is exercised--usually the end of the purchase period. This means that, in the period during which the stock has appreciated, the employee can get the benefit of the appreciation and, in a period during which the stock has depreciated, the employee might still be able to buy employer stock at a discounted price, or, if the plan 
   provides, could decline to purchase the stock. 
   For example, let's say the President announces in the budget for FY 2001 that international trade contributed to growth in US GDP in 1999. Fleet of Foot Shoes, an athletic shoe manufacturer in Florence, Oregon, decides to award its workers the full $2,000 trade bonus on February 1, 2000. If a share of Fleet of Foot stock is worth $100 on the date of the grant of the option and $200 when the option is exercised, say December 2001, the employees' purchase price can be as low as $85. This means the employee can purchase stock worth $200 for only $85, so the employee is able to purchase more than 40 shares of stock for the price of only 20 shares. Alternatively, if the stock is worth $50 when the option is exercised, the employee is able to purchase stock worth $50 for only $42.50. 
   Here is how the tax benefit would work. Under current law, employees who hold qualified stock at least two years from the date of grant of the option and one year from the purchase of the stock are entitled to a capital gains tax break until the point they sell the stock. If an employee chooses to sell stock purchased through the Trade Bonus and the purchase price was less than the fair market value on the date the option was granted, then the difference between the purchase price and the fair market value will be taxed as ordinary income in the year the stock is sold. Under my proposal, the remainder of the gain that would otherwise be taxed as a capital gain in the same year would not be taxed. So, using the Trade Bonus, if an employee pays $85 to buy a share of stock whose fair market value is $100, holds onto the share for more than the required two years and then sells it for $150, the $15 discount on the original purchase price would be taxed as ordinary income, but the employee would not pay capital gains tax on the $50 increase in the value of the share of stock. 
   About one-half of all American adults own stock today, and stocks are now the largest asset families own, exceeding even home equity. Fortune's January 2000 survey found 36 of the 58 publicly held companies on the top 100 list offer options to all employees. According to a 1998 survey of Oregon technology companies, almost two-thirds of Oregon's technology companies offer stock options. In today's tight employment market where companies compete to attract and retain the best employees, stock purchase plans are becoming increasingly common. The National Center for Employee Ownership estimates that seven and a half million Americans work for companies that make stock options available, and that employees own nine percent of total corporate equity in the United States. A recent Federal Reserve study found that one-third of the firms it surveyed offer stock options to employees other than executives.

   Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I have come to the floor repeatedly over the last few months to talk about the importance of prescription drug coverage under Medicare for the Nation's senior citizens. Today I want to focus on how the absence of this coverage essentially undermines our entire health care system. 
   What we are seeing is that every day, in the United States, senior citizens who are ailing from a variety of health problems end up getting sicker because they are not able to afford their prescription medicine. Very often these seniors end up being hospitalized and needing vastly more expensive medical services that are made available under what is called Part A of the Medicare program. 
   Today, I want to describe a case I recently learned about in Hillsboro, OR, because it illustrates just how irrational, how extraordinarily illogical, it is to have a health care system for the Nation's senior citizens that does not cover prescription drugs. 
   An orthopedist from Hillsboro, OR, recently wrote me that he actually had to hospitalize a patient for over 6 weeks because the patient needed antibiotics that they were not covered on an outpatient basis. 
   Here you had a frail, vulnerable older person. The physician, and all the medical specialists involved, believed that person could be treated on an outpatient basis with antibiotics, but because there was not Medicare coverage available on an outpatient basis--because there was not the kind of coverage Senator DASCHLE has been talking about and Senator SNOWE and I have made available in the Snowe-Wyden bipartisan legislation--because that coverage was not available to the senior citizen in Hillsboro, OR, that older person had to be hospitalized for over 6 weeks. 
   Here is what the doctor said to me:  
   This method of treatment [the preferred outpatient method of treatment] is cost effective and is preferred by patients and doctors. In this case, the patient is condemned to spend 6 weeks in the hospital solely to receive intravenous antibiotics. To me, this seems like a tremendous waste of money and resources. The patient would be better at home.  
   What this case illustrates is exactly why we need, on a bipartisan basis--the Snowe-Wyden legislation is one approach; our colleagues may have other ideas on how to do it--but this is a case study on why it is so important to cover prescription drugs for older people under Medicare. 
   We are not talking about some abstract academic kind of analysis that comes from one of the think tanks here in Washington, DC. This is a physician in Hillsboro, OR, who had to put a patient, an older person, in a hospital for 6 weeks because they could not afford to get their medicine on an outpatient basis. 
   A lot of our colleagues are here on the floor who are on the Commerce Committee. We look at technology issues at that Committee. The irony is, we can save money, again, through the use of new technology in health care. 
   The kind of treatment that would have been best for this older person in Oregon would have been through an electronic delivery system the older person could have used on their belt for a relatively short period of time had Medicare covered that prescription the older person needed. But because that person could not get coverage for the antibiotics and use that electronic delivery system on an outpatient basis, which they could wear on their belt, they had to go into a hospital for 6 weeks. 
   Colleagues, we are going to hear a lot over this break from senior citizens and families about the importance of this issue. I intend tomorrow, again, to come to the floor and discuss this matter. Senator DASCHLE has made it very clear to me, and talks 
   about it virtually every day, that he wants to have the Senate find the common ground. He wants Senators to come together and deal with this on a bipartisan basis. The Snowe-Wyden legislation is one approach. Our colleagues have other bills. 
   The point is, let us make sure, in this session of Congress, that in Arkansas, in Washington, and in the State of Nevada, we do not have older people hospitalized unnecessarily for 6 weeks because we have not come together as a Senate to make sure they can get those medicines on an outpatient basis. 
   Science has given us cost-effective, practical remedies for these people in need, remedies that will reduce suffering and will reduce costs to taxpayers. 
   Let us come together, on a bipartisan basis, to make sure we do not adjourn without adding this important benefit to the Medicare program. 
   As I have made clear, I intend to keep coming back to the floor of the Senate until we, on a bipartisan basis, as Senator DASCHLE has suggested, come together and get this important job done.  
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, this morning, I come to the floor to talk yet again about the issue of prescription drugs. I want to focus on an issue that Senator DASCHLE has, I think, been so correct in identifying as a priority, which is the issue of going forward with prescription drugs as part of a program that offers universal coverage. 
   Of course, when Medicare began in 1965, the Congress made the judgment that there would be a program available to all eligible seniors, that coverage would be universal for eligible seniors and for disabled folks. I think  it has been one of the unifying aspects of social policy in this country that all older people were covered. I think it is absolutely key that as we tackle this issue of prescription drug coverage, and do it in a bipartisan way, we remember how important the principle of covering all seniors is. 
   Now, I know there are colleagues on the other side of the aisle who feel strongly about this issue as well. I am very pleased in having teamed up with Senator SNOWE for more than a year. She and I are on a bill together, a bipartisan bill, which offers universal coverage. I also appreciate my colleague from Oregon, Senator SMITH, for being supportive of this effort. 
   There are a number of reasons why universal coverage is so important, and Senator DASCHLE has identified it as a priority for Senators on this side of the aisle. I want to talk for a moment about why I think it is so key in terms of designing a benefit properly. First, it is absolutely essential to ensure that seniors have as much bargaining power in the marketplace as possible. We have all been hearing from our constituents that many of them cannot afford the cost of prescription medicine. I have been coming to the floor of the Senate and reading from letters where older people, after they are done paying prescription drug bills, only have a couple hundred dollars for the rest of the month to live on. 
   We are seeing all across this country that many older people simply can't afford their medicine. If we are going to give them real bargaining power in the marketplace--and right now, to belong to an HMO, you have plenty of bargaining power--they can negotiate a good price for you. But if you are an individual senior walking into a pharmacy, you don't have a whole lot of bargaining power. In fact, you are subsidizing those big plans. If we design a prescription drug benefit so as to offer universal coverage, this gives us the largest available group of older people, the largest ``pool of individuals''--to use the language of the insurance industry--for purposes of making sure those older folks really do have bargaining power in the marketplace. 
   As we address this issue of bargaining power, I happen to think it is important that we do it in a way that doesn't bring about a lot of cost shifting onto other population groups. That is why the Snowe-Wyden legislation uses the model that Federal employees use for the purposes of their health coverage. As we talk about how to design this prescription drug program, I am hopeful we see universal coverage included. Beyond the fact it is what Medicare has been all about since the program began in 1965, it is absolutely key to make sure older people have the maximum amount of genuine bargaining power in the marketplace. 
   Second, I think if we were to do, as some have suggested--particularly those in the House--which is essentially to not have a program with universal coverage, but hand off a big pot of money to the States, and they could perhaps design a program for low-income people, we will have missed a lot of vulnerable seniors altogether. Their proposal--those who would hand off the money to the States to design a program for low-income people--as far as I can tell, would leave behind altogether seniors, say, with an income of $21,000 or $22,000, essentially a low- to middle-income senior. In most parts of the country, by any calculus, my view is that sum of money is awfully modest altogether. I see these proposals that hand a sum over to the States for low-income people as leaving a lot of seniors with $22,000, $25,000, or $28,000 incomes behind altogether. 
   If those individuals are taking medicine, say, for a chronic health problem--they might have a chronic health problem due to a heart ailment or something of that nature--they could be spending somewhere in the vicinity of $2,500 per year out of pocket on their prescription medicine. One out of four older people who have chronic illnesses such as the heart ailment are spending $2,500 a year out of pocket on their medicine. As far as I can tell, if they were in that lower- or middle-income bracket, they would simply be left behind altogether under these proposals that would just hand over a pot of money to the States and use this money for low-income people. 
   Many of the elderly people I described in income brackets of $22,000 or $28,000 and paying for chronic illnesses are the people we are hearing from now saying: If I get another increase in my insurance premium, I am going to simply have to leave my prescription at the pharmacist. My doctor phones it in, and I am not going to be able to afford to go and pick it up. 
   I think it is extremely important that the design of this program be built on the principle of universal coverage. That is what Medicare has been all about since the program began in 1965. It is what is going to ensure that the seniors have the maximum amount of bargaining power. We can debate issues within that concept of universal coverage so as to be more sensitive to those who have the least ability to pay. I have long believed Lee Iacocca shouldn't pay the same Medicare premium as a widow with an income of $14,000. I think we can deal with those issues as we go forward, if we decide early on that the centerpiece of an effective prescription drug benefit ought to be universal coverage. 
   There are other important issues we are going to have to discuss. I think there is now growing support for making sure this program is voluntary. When it is voluntary, you avoid some of the problems we are seeing with catastrophic care and ultimately you empower the consumer. It is going to be the consumer's choice in most communities to choose whether they want to go forward participating in this prescription drug program, or perhaps just stay with the coverage they may have. We estimate that perhaps a third of the older people in this country have coverage with which they are reasonably satisfied. If they are, under the kind of approach for which I think we are starting to see support in the Senate, those are folks who would not see their benefits touched; they could simply stay with the existing prescription drug coverage they have today. 
   Let's go forward. I think Senator DASCHLE in particular deserves credit for trying to bring the Senate together and for trying to reconcile the various bills. 
   Let's make sure we don't lose sight of the importance of universal coverage. It is key to giving older people real bargaining power in the marketplace--not through a government program but through marketplace forces, the way HMOs and insurance plans do. Focus on keeping the program voluntary. 
   I know there are colleagues on the other side of the aisle who share similar sentiments as the ones I voiced today. I particularly want to commend my colleagues, Senators SNOWE and SMITH. They have teamed up with me for more than a year now on a proposal that I think can win bipartisan support. In fact, we already have evidence of bipartisan support from the other side of the aisle because we got 54 votes on the floor of the Senate about a year ago for a plan to fund this program. 
   I intend to keep coming back to the floor of the Senate. Today, I thought it was important to express what Senator DASCHLE spoke on recently, which is universal coverage. I intend to keep coming back to the floor of this body again and again in an effort to build bipartisan support for making sure vulnerable seniors can get prescription drug coverage under Medicare. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. WYDEN. I think the Senator makes an extremely important point. I recall in the campaign with my friend and colleague, Senator GORDON SMITH, to succeed former Senator Packwood--we are from a small State as well, a little bigger than Nevada--Senator SMITH and I, between us, went through pretty close to $10 million in about 5 months. 
   Before the minority whip leaves the floor, I want to tell him I so appreciate him speaking out on this issue. 
   Certainly in Europe, for example, they are doing some of the things the distinguished minority whip is talking about: shortening the election cycle trying to generate interest in the elections because the campaign is over a short period of time. I think we can do that in this country and require, for example, that the campaign funds be disclosed online, which many of our colleagues have proposed on both sides of the aisle. 
   I want the Senator to know, before he leaves the floor, I very much appreciate his leadership in speaking out on this campaign finance issue, because we saw in Oregon much of what the Senator saw in Nevada.

   Mr. WYDEN. What the minority whip has essentially said is: We have what amounts to a permanent campaign. You have the election the first Tuesday in November; people sleep in on Wednesday; and then the whole thing starts all over again on Thursday. 
   It is time, in effect, to turn off this treadmill and, heaven forbid, come to the floor and talk about issues, such as prescription drugs, which I have tried to focus on for a number of months now. Many of our colleagues, on both sides of the aisle, want to talk about that, and the Patients' Bill of Rights, and education. To the extent that campaign finance dominates so much of the American political focus, it detracts from those issues. 
   I commend the minority whip. I thank him for his excellent presentation.

   Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, before I go on to touch on the issue of prescription drugs for a few moments, I, too, join with the majority leader, Senator LOTT, and the minority whip, Senator REID, in congratulating Senator BYRD on the anniversary of his Senate service. 
   I think what is especially striking about Senator BYRD's contributions is that when so many get tired, and so many get frustrated and exasperated with public service--we all know there is plenty in which you can be frustrated about--Senator BYRD does not give up. He does not flinch from the kinds of travails of public service. He seems to get stronger and stronger. 
   Those of us who watch him and seek him out for his counsel very much appreciate his contributions to the Senate. But this Senator especially appreciates one of his traits, which I think is the hallmark of being successful in any field, and that is his persistence. He is persistent about public service. He is persistent about upholding the standards of the Senate. 
   I join with the majority leader, Senator LOTT, and the minority whip in congratulating our friend and colleague, Senator BYRD.

   Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, since the fall, I, and other Members of the Senate, have come to the floor of this body  to talk about the need for prescription drug coverage for older people under Medicare. 
   As we look at this issue, I am especially pleased that Senator DASCHLE has been trying to reconcile the various legislative proposals that have been introduced on this issue. I know colleagues on the other side of the aisle have good ideas, as well. 
   I particularly commend my colleague, Senator SNOWE of Maine. She and I have teamed up, on a bipartisan basis, for more than a year now. Senator DASCHLE is trying to bring these bills together and make it possible for us to go forward and address this vital issue for seniors in a bipartisan way. 
   What I am struck by, and what I want to touch on for a moment or two this morning, is how significant the ramifications are with respect to this prescription drug issue. 
   For example, one issue I have not talked about in connection with this prescription drug matter is how it is directly and integrally tied to the matter of medical errors. Many of our colleagues were astounded at the end of last year when the Institute of Medicine produced a landmark study--a truly landmark study--documenting the problem of medical errors today in American health care. 
   These medical errors end up injuring many of our citizens, of course. They cost vast amounts of money. What is striking is how many of them are tied to problems connected with prescriptions. For example, we know when a senior cannot afford to take their prescription or ends up only taking two pills, when three of them are essentially recommended by their physician, that can constitute a breakdown in our health system or, in fact, what amounts to a medical error. 
   I think I have been coming to the floor of the Senate and talked on the issue of prescription drugs something like 26 times in the last few months, for example, talking about instances where folks at home in Oregon are actually breaking up their pills, their cholesterol-lowering pills, because they cannot afford to take the entire pill. They believe if they break up the pill they can stretch it. 
   These are the kinds of medical tragedies we are seeing across this country. They are errors that we can correct if we go forward and address this issue--prescription drug coverage--in a bipartisan way. 
   It seems unconscionable to think that, in a Nation as rich and good and powerful as ours, with all of these older people walking on an economic tightrope, balancing their food costs against their fuel costs, fuel costs against their medical bills, we can't go forward, as Senator DASCHLE has suggested, and reconcile these various bills that have been introduced on this issue and enact a comprehensive program to help older people with their prescription drug bills, reduce the kinds of errors the Institute of Medicine found, and help a lot of families in our country. 
   I think there really are three principles we ought to zero in on in terms of trying to address this issue. First, I think there is general agreement now that this program be voluntary. I think many Members of Congress remember the ill-fated catastrophic care legislation, with a lot of older people believing at that time that they were being forced to pay for catastrophic benefits they were already receiving under their existing private health coverage. 
   Now I believe there already is a bipartisan consensus--Senator DASCHLE has touched on this a couple of times recently--that a prescription drug program ought to be voluntary for older people and voluntary for the various providers, insurers, and pharmaceutical benefit managers who might decide to participate in the program. I think that minimizes the possibility that older people and families will believe they are being coerced by Government to pay for something they are already receiving. That voluntary aspect of such a program is one area where there already is bipartisan agreement. 
   Second, I think there is a general belief that rather than inventing an entirely new structure for this program, it must be integrally tied to the existing Medicare program and, in particular, fit with an agenda for Medicare reform. 
   What the legislation I have worked on--the Snowe-Wyden legislation--does is allow the administrative body--called the SPICE board, because our bill stands for Senior Prescription Insurance Coverage Equity or SPICE--to contract with a variety of entities, insurance companies or pharmaceutical benefit managers or nonprofit agencies--anybody who was authorized under State law to administer a program. That way, we are not creating a whole new structure for dealing with this program; we are building on Medicare as it exists today. At the same time, we are doing something else which is critical; that is, adding more choice to the Medicare program. 
   I personally think the effort to make this program voluntary, to build on existing Medicare coverage, which makes the benefits available to all seniors--universal coverage for those eligible for the program--and then, in addition to those principles, add new choices to the Medicare program. The reason that is so important is, providing choices is what is going to generate the competition that can help hold down the prices of medicines for our older people. 
   We see so many seniors who can't afford their medicine. There is a great debate going on in the country now about whether it is the research costs of these drugs that have contributed to it. There are a variety of reasons being offered for why older people cannot afford their prescription drugs. I am interested in debating those. 
   What I am most interested in is making sure older people have the kind of bargaining power necessary to drive down the costs of their medicine. It seems to me they can get that bargaining power through an approach based on choice, such as we have, as Members of Congress, through the Federal Employees Health Benefits system. I am very hopeful that that expanded array of choices will be a key invisible part of a bipartisan effort to go forward and address this issue in the Senate. 
   As we head to a period of town meetings and discussions with folks at home, I know my colleagues are going to hear accounts from 
   older people and families about horrible, tragic instances where older people cannot afford medicine and often end up getting sicker and needing much more expensive care when they cannot get those essential prescriptions. I think we have made a lot of progress in the last 2 or 3 months, with Senator DASCHLE having taken the lead, many colleagues on the other side of the aisle trying to bring the Senate together to find the common ground. I think we made a lot of progress. 
   I am hopeful that when the Senate reconvenes after this break to visit with folks at home, when the Budget Committee goes forward--and Senator SNOWE and I both sit on the Budget Committee--that with the bipartisan leadership of Senator DOMENICI and Senator LAUTENBERG, we can get a generous earmark in the budget to cover prescription drugs and, in effect, continue the progress we have made towards getting a bipartisan prescription drug program enacted in this session of the Senate. 
   I have talked with Senator LAUTENBERG, ranking Democrat, Senator CONRAD, others who have been involved in this issue on our side, and with Senator DOMENICI on the other side of the aisle. I think there is a real openness to making sure there is a generous earmark in that budget for a prescription drug program we would enact this year. After we get over that hurdle, the challenge will be, as Senator DASCHLE has outlined, to reconcile the various approaches that have been offered. As I mentioned, Senator SNOWE and I have one we think makes sense, but we do not believe we have the last word. 
   We think the last word ought to belong to the American people. The American people are saying: We want you to deliver on this prescription drug issue. We want it done this session. We do not want it to go through yet another campaign season as campaign fodder through the fall. We want you to get it done this year. Take the steps necessary to provide older people the relief they need and deserve. 
   I look forward to being part of that effort in a bipartisan fashion. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. WYDEN. I am pleased to join today with my colleague from Michigan, Senator ABRAHAM, to offer the New Millennium Classrooms Act as an amendment to the Education Savings Account legislation. This is an issue on which he and I have worked for several years now. 
   The New Millennium Classrooms Act is about digital recycling. It gives companies an incentive to recycle technology. It says the computer Bill Gates may see as a dinosaur, is really a dynamic new opportunity for a student who has none. 
   The E-Rate program, authored by Senators ROCKEFELLER and SNOWE, has been an enormous success, helping to wire almost all of the nation's schools and a good portion of the nation's classrooms. What schools need now is good equipment. That's the purpose of this amendment. 
   We know that very early in this new Century 60% of all jobs will require high-tech computer skills. To prepare our children for the jobs of the future, they not only must have access to technology, but they must be trained to use it as well. 
   The purpose of our amendment is to build more bridges between the technology ``haves'' and the ``have nots;'' to build more on-ramps to the information superhighway. You can't get 21st Century classrooms, using Flintstones technology. 
   Technology is not cheap and school budgets are limited, making it tough for schools to upgrade their systems by themselves. The point of our amendment is to enhance existing incentives to businesses to donate computer equipment to schools. 
   There is a federal program in place, the 21st Century Classroom Act of 1997, but its use has been limited. It allows businesses to take a tax deduction for certain computer equipment donations to K-12 schools. But most businesses take longer to upgrade their computers than allowed for under the law. 
   The New Millennium Classrooms Act would make this law work the way it was intended. First, our legislation would increase the age limit from two to three years for donated equipment eligible for a tax credit. This more realistically tracks the time line businesses follow for their computer upgrades. It will cover hardware that possesses the necessary memory capacity and graphics capability to support Internet and multimedia applications. 
   Second, our bill expands the current limitation of ``original use'' to include both original equipment manufacturers and any corporation that reacquires their equipment. We believe that by expanding the number of donors eligible for the credit, we will expand the number of computers donated to schools. 
   Third, our bill provides for a 30% tax credit of the fair market value for school computer donations, and a 50% credit for donations to schools located in empowerment zones, enterprise communities and Indian reservations. The Department of Commerce report highlights the need to encourage computer donation in these notoriously under-served communities and we want to target donations toward these communities. 
   Finally, our bill requires an operating system to be included on a donated computer's hard drive in order to qualify for the tax credit. This will ensure students don't get empty computer shells, but the brains that drive the computers. 
   Our legislation is supported by a wide range of business and education groups. Leaders of technology associations, like the Information Technology Industry Council and TechNet, and the National Association of Manufacturers have joined education associations, such as the National Association of Secondary School Principals and the National Association of State University and Land Grant Colleges, in support of the amendment. 
   The Digital Millennium Classrooms Act promotes digital recycling. It will encourage companies to put their used computers into classrooms instead of into landfills. It will help build a safety net under students trying to cross the digital divide. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment, and again wish to commend Senator ABRAHAM for his leadership on this legislation.

   Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, this morning the Democratic Policy Committee had a very important hearing on the issue of prescription drug coverage under Medicare for the Nation's older people. We heard from senior citizens, we heard from pharmacists, we heard from gerontologists, extraordinarily compelling testimony about why this prescription drug benefit is so important. 
   Frankly, I do not think there is a single Member of the Senate, whether they are a Democrat or a Republican, who would not be moved by what we heard this morning. The senior citizens, as we hear again and again in townhall meetings at home, are pointing out that they cannot afford their prescription medicines. 
   The pharmacists went into detail about how frustrated they are that so many of the older people lack bargaining power in the marketplace, bargaining power that can help them drive down the cost of their medicine. I thought the gerontologists we heard from this morning were very compelling in making the case of how so many of these drugs today can promote wellness and help seniors stay healthy and keep from racking up these extraordinary medical bills that are so often incurred and require hospitalization under what is called Part A of the Medicare program. 
   It is so important that we come together as a body to address this issue. Senator DASCHLE, in particular, mentions to me on almost a daily basis how he wants to reconcile the various bills. He wants to reach out to colleagues on the other side of the aisle. In particular, I praise my colleague, Senator SNOWE. She and I have worked for over a year on a bipartisan effort with respect to prescription drugs. 
   I know colleagues on the other side of the aisle are interested in this issue as well. Frankly, I think any Member of the Senate who heard what the Democratic Policy Committee heard this morning had to have been moved by how great the need is for prescription drug coverage for seniors. 
   One of the issues that has come up in recent days is this question of whether private insurance companies are going to be interested in this benefit and whether they are going to be willing to update their policies. We are hearing a lot of talk that maybe they are not and they are not going to come forward. 
   I guess we are starting to hear from the same crowd who said doctors and hospitals in the early sixties were not going to participate in the Medicare program. It is preposterous to say private insurers are not going to participate once we go forward and enact a responsible bipartisan prescription drug program for seniors under Medicare. 
   What the Snowe-Wyden legislation does is make it very clear the money that would be earmarked under our bipartisan bill would be made available to pick up the prescription drug portion of a senior citizen's private health insurance bill. 
   The Presiding Officer, who has great expertise in this area as well, knows that the vast majority of seniors have these private policies--Medigap policies, HMO policies, a variety of private policies today. 
   I am absolutely convinced that when we go forward to enact this program on a bipartisan basis, as we heard in the Democratic policy session this morning, private insurance companies all over this country will tear up their existing contracts with older people and add the prescription drug program that we enact this year to their coverage. By the way, they would not be required to do it. Under our legislation and other bills, this would be voluntary for both private insurance companies and for older people. 
   The reason why I believe private insurance companies are going to be very eager to participate is that they will not be able to be competitive with the various other companies in an area unless they offer the benefit. 
   If you took a Salt Lake City, UT, or a Portland, OR, or a Denver, CO, where there are a variety of insurers, once we enact this program, seniors are going to go to private insurers and ask: Are you offering this particular benefit? Because we see the Congress has passed a law making available funds to pick up the prescription drug portion of a senior citizen's private health insurance bill. 
   I think all this talk about how private insurance companies are not going to be interested in offering this benefit is incredibly farfetched. While our proposal and the other good proposals that  are offered are voluntary, we are already hearing from insurance companies that they are going to be very interested in offering this benefit. In fact, many of them are going to believe they have to do it in order to be competitive in their community. 
   I hope--I did want to be brief tonight--we can go forward in the days ahead and act on this matter as priority business before the Senate. I intend to keep coming to the floor to bring to the attention of this body cases from home and from across this country of older people who, when they are done paying their prescription drug bills, literally have only a few hundred dollars a month to pay for their food and their rent and their utilities. It is outrageous, in a country as good and strong as ours, that we have not updated our health care system to provide this coverage. 
   Because I have come to the floor now 25 times in 3 months to talk about this issue, and Senator DASCHLE's effort to bring the Senate together, to reach out to colleagues on the other side of the aisle, I am asked all the time: Can America afford to cover prescription drugs for older people? My response is: We can't afford not to cover prescription drugs. 
   What the gerontologists told us today is that if you want, for the long-term, to promote wellness and to keep seniors healthy, make these drugs--the drugs that lower blood pressure and cholesterol--available to seniors because with them seniors will be able to stay healthy and not rack up these much larger medical bills that are incurred when they are ill. 
   One of the most striking examples I have seen in this discussion involves the anticoagulant drugs, the drugs that prevent strokes. It might cost $1,000 or $1,500 for a senior to get those drugs for a year--certainly that is expensive--but if, through drugs such as that, you can prevent stroke--which 
   will cost upwards of $100,000--it seems to me it makes a very clear case that we ought to be offering this benefit. 
   I recognize that colleagues have different views as to how to go about doing it. Several of my Democratic colleagues have bills. I do not expect to have the last word on this subject. I know colleagues on the other side of the aisle have legislation, as well. I am very honored to have been able to team up with Senator SNOWE for 15 months now in an effort to pass this prescription drug benefit on a bipartisan basis. 
   But let us make sure this issue does get addressed, and addressed in this Congress. Because to let this become fodder for another political season, and to have the back and forth that would go on in a political campaign, where one side blames the other side, is not productive. That is not what Senator DASCHLE wants to have, as he tries to bring together the various approaches that have been offered by Members of the Senate. I know there are a number of Republicans who want to avoid that kind of train-wreck scenario where you do not act on this issue; instead, it just becomes the fodder for another political campaign. 
   What the Democratic Policy Committee heard this morning from seniors, from pharmacists, from gerontologists, ought to be compelling to every Member of this body--Democrats, Republicans, liberals, and conservatives. 
   Let us debate the specifics about how to go about offering this benefit, but let us make sure this issue gets done because I do not think it is right for the country to wait any longer to move forward on an issue that is so vital to health care reform. 
   I intend to keep coming back to the floor to address this issue. The session held by the Democratic Policy Committee was so compelling this morning that I wanted to take a couple minutes to bring it to the attention of the Senate. 
   I wish to make it clear that I look forward to working with all of my colleagues on a bipartisan basis. The Presiding Officer--the Senator from Utah--and I have talked about health care on a number of occasions since I have been in the Senate. He has great expertise. We are going to involve him in this cause and get it done in a bipartisan way. 
   I think this morning's program by the Democratic Policy Committee was another step in the right direction. 
   With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. WYDEN. 
   Mr. President, I am introducing legislation to correct a technical error made by the U.S. Customs Service, and exempt Waldron Pacific from antidumping duties which were retroactively applied by Customs to three import shipments of titanium. This bill is a companion to legislation introduced by Representative DAVID WU in the House of Representatives. 
   Waldron Pacific, a small business located in Lake Oswego, Oregon, is a distributor of non-ferrous alloys, such as aluminum, zinc and brass, used in the die casting and foundry industries. With just two employees, Waldron Pacific has been a very successful business operation. 
   When a customer of Waldron Pacific needed a certain type of titanium not available in this country, the entrepreneurial Waldron Pacific found a supplier outside the U.S., in Russia. Having no import experience, but hearing of potential antidumping duties on certain titanium products, Waldron Pacific sought a binding Classification Ruling from Customs before importing the product. Customs' Classification Ruling indicated that the proper import duty was 15%, and Waldron Pacific began importing the product to fulfill the needs of its customer. After three shipments had been imported, Customs revoked its previous Classification Ruling and applied retroactively an additional 85% antidumping duty on these shipments. The three shipments had already been imported, delivered and paid for by Waldron Pacific's customer, leaving Waldron Pacific liable to pay $42,000 in unexpected duties. 
   Whether or not the product should be subject to the antidumping order is not at issue nor is that the matter addressed by this legislation. The key point is that Waldron Pacific exercised due diligence in obtaining a Classification Ruling prior to importing the product, and relied upon that Classification Ruling as a basis for importing and selling the product. Even the domestic producers who are protected by the antidumping order agree that Waldron Pacific should not have to pay antidumping duties on these three shipments. Ironically, the antidumping order has since been repealed entirely. Providing Waldron Pacific relief from Customs' mistake and subsequent attempt to retroactively apply a higher tariff is a question of basic fairness. 
   The legislation I am introducing today would correct this technical error and exempt these import shipments from the unfair, retroactive application of antidumping duties.

   Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, for many months now, I and other Members of this body have been coming to the floor to talk about the need for prescription drug coverage for our older people under Medicare. I have brought to the floor on more than 20 occasions specific cases of older people who, in so many instances, are walking an economic tightrope, trying to balance their food costs against their prescription drug bill, their prescription drug bill against some other necessity. More and more of these older people and their families simply cannot make ends meet. 
   I wish to address the question of whether this country can afford to cover prescription drugs for older people under Medicare. I submit this Nation cannot afford not to cover these essential health care services. 
   We talked on the floor about the important drugs such as Lipitor, a cholesterol-lowering drug used by many older people. These drugs are absolutely key to keeping older people well. There is no question that right now if the Government were to pick up the costs of these medicines there would be additional costs, but the savings generated as a result of extending prescription drug coverage to older people, in my view, would be staggering. 
   I continually cite the exciting contributions made by these new medicines that prevent strokes. They are known as anticoagulant drugs. For an older person, it might cost perhaps $1,000 a year to pay for the drugs, anticoagulant drugs that prevent these strokes, but if you prevent a stroke you could save upwards of $100,000 through an investment that is just a small fraction of those costs. 
   I am very hopeful it will now be possible to reconcile the various bills that cover prescription drugs for older people. Senator DASCHLE has talked to me on a number of occasions, even a few hours ago, indicating he is very interested in seeing the Congress come together on a bipartisan basis and enact this legislation to meet the needs of older people and better utilize the dollars that are available for health care in this country. 
   The stories we have accumulated from home are tragic. I heard yesterday from an older woman in Tillamook, OR. She recently took another senior, an 80-year-old woman, to the emergency room. This 80-year-old woman said she could not afford the one medication she needed to control her high blood pressure. As a result, she almost died. 
   From what we are seeing across this country, we either now go forward and make a well-targeted investment to make sure vulnerable seniors get help with prescription drugs or we end up with vastly more people suffering and much increased costs. 
   I have received scores of letters from across rural Oregon. These are from people who have to drive 40 miles, 50 miles to a pharmacy. They don't have big health plans that negotiate discounts for them. 
   In Baker City, OR, I have been told by an older couple they are getting by on $200, the two of them, for their entire month after they are done paying their prescription drug bills. There is not a one of us in the Senate who could live in that kind of arrangement where they essentially had only a couple of hundred dollars a month to pay for their food and shelter and other 
   essentials. A country as good and rich and strong as ours is capable of addressing this need. I think it can be done using an approach that relies on marketplace forces. 
   I particularly wish to praise my colleague from Maine, Senator SNOWE. I have been able to team up with her on this prescription drug issue for 14 months. When we started in the Budget Committee, I think a lot of folks looked at us and said, Senator SNOWE, Senator WYDEN, they are well meaning but there is no chance this prescription drug issue is going to be addressed. 
   We have seen over the last few months tremendous progress. There is not a Member of Congress, Democrat or Republican, who goes home and doesn't get asked about this issue. We have a chance to bring the various bills together. Senator DASCHLE wishes to do so, and I know a number of Republicans want to do so as well. Our colleagues in the Senate recognize this ought to be a voluntary program. A lot of lessons have been learned since the catastrophic care issue came before the Congress. This is not going to be a mandatory program. This is not going to be a one-size-fits-all program from Washington. This is going to be based on voluntary choice. We are going to use the dollars that are raised for this program to pick up the prescription drug portion of a senior citizen's private health insurance. 
   I am not talking about a federalized health care system. We are talking about using private health insurance, making sure older people have a variety of choices and offerings. As a result of those choices and offerings, they can have some big bargaining power. 
   What happens right now is the health plans, the HMOs, big buyers, go out and negotiate a discount. If you are an older person in rural Nebraska or rural Oregon and you don't have prescription drug coverage, you walk into the Rite Aid or a Fred Meyer or one of your drugstores and you, in effect, have to subsidize the big buyers who are in a position to negotiate discounts. We can use private marketplace forces, the way the Snowe-Wyden legislation does, and the way several of the other bills do, to make sure older people have the kind of bargaining power that makes these prescription drugs more affordable. 
   I am very pleased that this issue has become a bigger priority in the Congress in the last few weeks. I think now is going to be a test of whether we can,  as Senator DASCHLE and others have suggested, reconcile the various bills that have been introduced on this issue. I do not expect to have the last word on this matter. 
   Senator SNOWE and I are very proud the financing of our legislation received 54 votes in the Senate when it came up last year. On the Snowe-Wyden amendment, we saw Senator WELLSTONE vote for it, Senator SANTORUM vote for it, Senator KENNEDY vote for it, and Senator ABRAHAM vote for it. That is a pretty good coalition. That is the kind of coalition we can build if we pick up on the counsel of Senator DASCHLE, and I know a number of Republican leaders, to come together and reconcile these various bills. 
   I intend to keep coming to the floor and reading these cases. Our friend, Senator KERREY, is here. I know he is going to be speaking on an important issue, and I do not want to detain him. I think in this country we are now seeing older people break their pills in half because they cannot afford to pick up the cost of medicine when we have, as we saw in Tillamook, OR, 80-year-old women being taken to emergency rooms and not able to afford their medicine. It is wrong. It is just wrong for this Congress to not address this issue in a bipartisan way this year. 
   This is not one we ought to put off until after the election and see it used as a political football. It should not be used as fodder for the campaign trail because if it is, too many older people who cannot afford their medicine are going to suffer. 
   We have a chance to move on a bipartisan basis to reconcile these various bills. I intend to keep coming to the floor of this body again and again to describe these cases, to show how urgent the need is. The President at the State of the Union Address made it clear he was extending the olive branch to both political parties to work with him on this issue. We ought to seize, on a bipartisan basis, the opportunity to use private health insurance, not some federalized Government program, to make sure we meet the needs of older people for prescription medicine. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, for many months now I and other Members of  the Senate have been coming to the floor of this body to talk about the need for prescription drug coverage for our older people under Medicare. 
   We have been going through case histories of stories we have been hearing from our States. I have been describing the many older people I am hearing from in Oregon where after they are finished paying their prescription drug bill, they only have a couple hundred dollars for the rest of the month to live on. 
   I talked about instances where older people at home in Oregon are actually breaking their Lipitor pills. Lipitor is an important cholesterol-lowering drug. A lot of the seniors at home in Oregon can't afford to take these vital medicines, and they are actually having to break them in half in order to try to meet their health care needs. It is just outrageous to think that in a country as rich and as powerful and good as ours so many of our seniors walk on this economic tightrope. 
   I have come to the floor repeatedly over the last few months to talk about the need for bipartisan legislation that would address the needs of older people and secure important Medicare coverage for them. 
   I believe there is now genuine interest in reconciling the several bills before the Senate on this issue and a real opportunity to enact good legislation that can generate overwhelming support in this body and get the senior citizens of this country the help they need. 
   I have spoken, for example, with the Democratic leader, Senator DASCHLE, several times this week on this subject. He is very interested in bringing Senators with varying approaches on this issue together so we find the common ground to get help for older people. 
   I especially want to praise my colleague from Maine, our friend, Senator SNOWE. She and I have worked together for 14 months now--for more than a year starting with the budget resolution last year--to come up with a bipartisan plan to address this enormous need of older people. 
   Before I describe some of the new cases we are getting from seniors across the country, I will talk about some areas where I think there is common ground, the common ground I have heard Senator DASCHLE and others talking about in recent days. For example, I think Senators overwhelmingly believe there ought to be a significant role for marketplace forces in the delivery of this benefit. Certainly we differ about the details. We recognize that. I will not have the last word on this subject. I think virtually all Senators believe there ought to be a significant role for marketplace forces on this issue. 
   Second, I think there is overwhelming support for the proposition that this program ought to be a voluntary program. Senators and others have learned the lesson from the catastrophic care bill when a lot of the older people in this country said: This is something I am already getting; I don't want it required; I think my money can be spent better elsewhere. 
   This time, I see Senators with varying political philosophies desiring to make sure this benefit is voluntary. 
   I think Senators overwhelmingly are interested in making sure this prescription drug coverage for older people is consistent with long-term Medicare reform. Many want to have comprehensive Medicare reform in this session of Congress. It may still be doable. I prefer going that route. If it is not possible to have comprehensive Medicare reform, I can tell Members that Senator SNOWE and I have teamed up over the last several months in an effort to make sure the prescription drug coverage program is consistent with long-term Medicare reform. 
   Finally, we want to make sure this benefit is adequately funded. In the last session of Congress, 54 Members of the Senate voted for the Snowe-Wyden amendment with respect to funding. We brought together Senator WELLSTONE, Senator ABRAHAM, Senator KENNEDY, Senator SANTORUM, Senators of all political philosophies of both political parties. Mr. President, 54 voted for allocating dollars for a prescription drug program. There is an opportunity now to find the common ground. 
   I want to describe a few of the accounts I have heard from at home that made it clear to me why it is so important that Senators come together and enact this program for the elderly. I heard recently from an elderly woman in Deschutes County in central Oregon. She is 83 years old; she lives at her sister's. She and her 79-year-old husband take 12 drugs to cover diabetes, hypertension, and a variety of ailments. Their sole source of income is Social Security. They spend nearly 25 percent of their income now on prescription drugs. 
   In Clatsop County, a retired couple in their seventies from Warrenton, OR, is spending $450 a month on prescription drugs. If they have another increase in their supplemental insurance--and we all know the vast majority of seniors have these supplemental policies, and we all know in almost every instance they go up--this older couple has told me they will have to stop taking their medication altogether. 
   An older woman in Coos County, aged 75, getting by on only $813 a month, is spending well over $200 of that $800 on prescription medicine. 
   I could go on with these cases. I have done that on more than 20 occasions in the last few months on the floor of the Senate, trying continually to bring before the body 3 or 4 cases that highlight how great the need is and how important it is we 
   address this issue. 
   I believe the President of the United States wants this issue addressed in a bipartisan way. I have talked with him about this subject. He recognizes how urgent it is that seniors get this coverage. I think he made it clear in the State of the Union Address he wants to work with Members of Congress of both political parties to get this done. 
   We have accomplished a great deal in the last 14 months. Fourteen months ago when Senator SNOWE and I brought this issue to the Budget Committee, I think we were essentially looked at as well-meaning souls but people who just did not have much of a prospect of seeing this go forward. Now we see the issue of prescription drug coverage as one of the two or three most pressing domestic issues. The American people are disgusted. 
   Our job now--and I commend Senator DASCHLE, but I know there are a number of colleagues on the other side of the aisle who feel the same way--is to reconcile these various bills. We want to make sure we build on private health insurance. 
   There has been a lot of talk in the last few days about whether private health insurance companies would be interested in this program. Having talked with them at home in Oregon, they are definitely going to be interested in this program because what we envisage doing, what essentially all the bills envisage doing, is having the Government pick up the prescription drug portion of a senior's private health insurance program. That is what is going to go on here. We will not set up new bureaucracies and redtape. We will be looking at an effort to have this program pick up the prescription drug portion of a senior's private health insurance. We want to use marketplace forces to the greatest possible extent. We want older people to have bargaining power in the marketplace. 
   Right now, Medicare does not cover prescriptions, but the older person who walks into a pharmacy perhaps in Rhode Island, Oregon, or any other part of the country and does not have prescription drug coverage, in effect, has to subsidize the big buyers of prescription medicine. If, for example, you are a younger worker and have the good fortune of having a company health plan that covers prescription drugs, that company plan can go out and negotiate a discount. The senior, without any coverage, walks into the pharmacy, doesn't get that same rate, and in effect has to actually subsidize those who do have the good fortune of having a health plan where they can have some real bargaining power. That is not right. Vulnerable seniors deserve a fair shake. They deserve to be able to secure their medicine at an affordable price. 
   I believe the cases I brought to the floor of the Senate tonight again show how urgent the need is for this benefit. I believe there are colleagues on both sides of the aisle who want to reconcile the various bills that have been introduced on this issue. I have teamed up with Senator SNOWE on this matter now for 14 months. We don't think we have the last word on this issue. We want to work with colleagues to find the common ground, to get the help to  older people that they deserve. Senator DASCHLE has told me a number of times recently that is what he wants to do. 
   I believe colleagues on the other side of the aisle wish to do so as well. 
   The hour is late. I do not want to keep the Senate in any longer than necessary, but I intend to keep coming back to the floor, bringing to the Senate these truly poignant cases of how great the need is in this country to cover prescription drug costs of the Nation's older people. 
   I look forward to working with the Presiding Officer of the Senate, a new Member of this body, and one from a very special family, in my opinion, because his father was so kind to me as a new Senator. I know he shares many of the same concerns I have, that we address this issue in a bipartisan fashion. 
   I am going to keep coming back to the floor of the Senate talking about why this is so important and why it is so important for the Senate to bring these various bills together. 
   With that, I yield the floor.

   Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, similar to many of our colleagues, I have been back home in my State at townhall meetings. One of the very consistent themes I heard is that folks want to see us address some of the key issues of our time, particularly the economic issues. 
   I have heard again and again--and it is clear--that millions of senior citizens cannot afford their prescription medicine. I heard again and again that millions of married couples are being shackled by this marriage tax penalty. It seems to me Congress can fashion a prudent, well-crafted bill that addresses this marriage tax penalty and also responds to the concerns of seniors--without blowing up the budget, without violating the principles of fiscal responsibility, and by prudent use of the surplus. 
   Democrats want to see--and Democrats are anxious to work with Republicans on this--an effort to help the many seniors and families who are walking on an economic tightrope trying to afford their prescription drug bills. We want to see meaningful tax relief for married couples. What we have to do is work together, in a bipartisan way, to fashion that. 
   I will spend just a minute talking about how serious this prescription drug problem is for the Nation's older people. 
   When I was home recently, I heard from an elderly woman in Yoncalla, OR. She lives by herself. She lives in southern Oregon. She has an income of about $500 a month. When she is done paying her prescription drug bill, she has just a little bit over $200 to live on for the rest of the month. She lives a long way from pharmacies, so she cannot very well comparison shop. 
   She wants to know, why isn't it possible for this Congress to enact a prescription drug benefit for her and for others similarly situated? My view is, if we do not enact a prescription drug benefit for this person, she is going to end up a lot sicker and with a lot more health problems than she has today. That will be much more expensive to the taxpayers. 
   In addition, I recently heard from an elderly couple from Baker, OR, who have to take a great many prescription drugs. After their monthly medication, together they have less than $200 on which to get by. They said in their letter: ``That is not living. That is existing.'' 
   Colleagues, it is very clear that in a country as rich and as strong as ours, we clearly are capable of doing justice to the vulnerable older people, such as the elderly folks I described from rural Oregon who are struggling to make ends meet and cannot afford their prescription drugs. 
   People ask us all the time: Can we afford prescription drug coverage? My message is: We cannot afford not to cover prescription drugs. 
   One of these anticoagulant medicines that helps prevent strokes in older people might cost $1,000 or $1,500 a year--certainly pricey--but you prevent that stroke with the medication and you save upwards of $100,000 that an older person might incur in expenses for problems associated with the stroke. 
   What we need to do--and the President has one approach; Senator KENNEDY has another approach; Senator SNOWE and I have worked together on a bipartisan basis--is bring these bills together and make sure we use marketplace forces to hold down the costs of prescription drugs for older people. Each one of these bills--the kind of approach the President is talking about, as well as the approaches Senator KENNEDY and Senator SNOWE and I are  talking about--each one of these approaches makes sure the dollars we earmark for this program are used to pay the prescription drug portion of an older person's private health insurance bill. 
   You hear a whole lot of talk these days about how the insurance companies would not possibly be interested in this. Of course they are going to be interested in this. I have talked to them from my area. They are anxious to see the Government in a responsible, prudent program, for which I believe there is now bipartisan support. They are anxious to see Medicare pick up the prescription drug portion of a senior's private health insurance bill. 
   With a lot of my colleagues on the Democratic side--and I know Senator SNOWE and others on the Republican side want to address this as well--I intend to keep coming to the floor of the Senate and keep reading these letters and describing the circumstances of older people who want to see this Congress enact meaningful relief for prescription drug costs before we adjourn. 
   Medicare did not cover prescription drugs when it began. Right now, the senior citizen who does not have prescription drug coverage is basically subsidizing other people in this country who do have coverage whose plans are able to negotiate discounts. That is not right. It is not fair. 
   We can enact meaningful prescription drug coverage under the Medicare program in this session of Congress. Until we do, I and other Democrats are going to keep coming to this floor, reading the accounts of seniors who are facing these staggering prescription drug costs they cannot afford. 
   I intend to keep working with Senator SNOWE and Senator KENNEDY, and my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, so the legacy of this session of the Congress can be that we stood up for a fair shake for the millions of vulnerable older Americans and their families. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. WYDEN. Thank you, Mr. President. 
   I want to tell the Senator from Minnesota how much I appreciate him speaking up for the Capitol Hill police officers. When we think about the many people in this country who are decent and caring, right up at the top of the list are those folks who serve this country as Capitol Hill police officers. I commend the Senator for his persistence in being willing to speak up for those folks day after day. I will find time to come out and join him.

   Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President and colleagues, I have made it clear my top priority for this session of Congress is to make sure that we finally add prescription drug coverage for senior citizens to the Medicare program. 
   Towards that end, I have teamed up for more than a year with Senator Olympia SNOWE of Maine with a proposal we believe can win bipartisan support in this Congress and effectively respond to the enormous need that all of us are seeing as we go home to our communities and visit with older people. The Snowe-Wyden prescription drug legislation is bipartisan. It is marketplace oriented--we use competitive forces as a tool to hold down the prescription drug bills for senior citizens. All of us in the Senate can identify with the approach we are using because the Snowe-Wyden legislation is modeled after the Federal Employee Health Benefit Plan which all of us in the Congress are fortunate to enjoy. 
   As part of our campaign to get this bipartisan legislation enacted, I have made a commitment to come to this floor again and again and urge senior citizens, as this poster says, to send in copies of their prescription drug bills. We would like seniors to send in copies of their bills to each of us in the Senate, Washington, DC, 20510. 
   As part of the effort to win passage of this legislation or a similar approach to it, I am going to come to the floor of the Senate again and again and again and read from some of the letters I am receiving from older people. 
   For example, recently I had a chance to hear from an elderly woman who lives in Yoncalla, in southern Oregon. It is a small town. Her closest pharmacy is about 30 miles away. She has diabetes; she has osteoporosis. Her Social Security check, the entire source of her income, is $567 a month. She is taking eight different medications for her health problems. Her monthly drug costs come to about $400 a month. That leaves this elderly woman in southern Oregon with less than $200 a month to live on after she is done paying her prescription drug bill. Think about that, think about what it is like for an older person in this country having just a couple hundred dollars a month to pay for food and heat or other medical expenses. 
   She told us she has had to basically cut back on buying her drugs on a monthly basis because she knows, unless she juggles all her bills, she is not going to be able to come close to meeting all of her obligations. She has $567 a month, lives in a small town, Yoncalla, Oregon. The pharmacy is a pretty good distance away; she has diabetes; she has osteoporosis, and when she is done paying her prescription drug bill, she has only about $200 a month left to live on. That is a disgrace. That is wrong in a country as rich and good and powerful as ours. 
   Under the Snowe-Wyden bipartisan prescription drug legislation, with a modest copayment that woman would be able to get health insurance to cover her prescription drug bill. Our legislation would pick up essentially completely the prescription drug portion of her health insurance premium. 
   The reality is, a person such as that older woman in Yoncalla is hit by a double whammy. Medicare does not cover prescription drugs and hasn't since the program began in 1965; and, second, she is in effect subsidizing big buyers, health maintenance organizations, big health plans that go out and negotiate discounts. It is no wonder that very often we see older people in our communities in this situation. This story is representative. I am getting accounts similar to this continuously. In every community in this country there are similar people who are walking an economic tightrope, seniors who, every month, balance their food bill against their fuel costs, and fuel costs against medical expenses. If they have any unexpected expenses at all that month, they fall off the economic tightrope and go further and further into the hole. 
   Another older couple I heard from recently, this time from my hometown in Portland, told me they spend $5,264 a year on medications. This older couple gets Social Security benefits. The husband has a veteran's pension. Between the various sources of 
   income they have, they receive just under $12,000 a year. They have to spend over $5,000 of it on prescription medicines. I am not going to go into all the details of this, but they sent me an itemized bill of four pages that outlines the prescriptions they are paying for on a regular basis. Mr. President, $5,000 a year of their $12,000 income goes to pay for these medicines. 
   I think we can come up with a bipartisan approach to deal with this issue, one that is marketplace oriented. We have a good model in the Federal Employees Health Plan. Senator SNOWE and I are very proud that when we brought the funding plan for our legislation to the floor of the Senate as part of the budget last session we got 54 votes. A majority of the Senate is now on record in support of ensuring we fund prescription drug coverage for older people. 
   I was very pleased with how the President handled the prescription drug issue at the State of the Union Address. He made it clear he was not interested in scapegoating anybody or saying Republicans were at fault or somebody else was at fault for not getting this enacted. He made it clear he wanted to work with the U.S. Congress. He said the need is urgent. He left open the opportunity to work with Republicans and Democrats on the particulars. Senator SNOWE and I believe our approach is one that makes sense. We are proud of the fact we got the majority of the Senate on record voting for a funding approach for it. 
   But our colleagues have lots of other good ideas. We recognize that. Our bill is called SPICE, the Seniors Prescription Insurance Coverage Equity Act. Other colleagues have other ideas as well. I hope seniors across the country will consider this poster I have up here that says, ``Send In Your Prescription Drug Bill,'' to each of us in the Senate, Washington, DC, 20510. 
   I am going to keep coming to the floor of the Senate, reading from these letters, reading from these accounts. Today you heard about an older person in Yoncalla, an older woman in southern Oregon literally with less than a couple hundred dollars a month left to live on when she is done paying for her prescription drug bill, and an elderly couple in Portland who worked hard all their lives, always played by the rules, who are spending more than half their income on prescription drugs. 
   I will wrap up with this point. We as a nation are just starting to have the debate about whether we can afford to cover prescription drugs. My view is we cannot afford not to cover prescription drugs. If that older woman in Yoncalla cannot get help with her prescriptions when she has diabetes and osteoporosis and she is taking eight medications, if that couple in Portland cannot afford their medications, all of the gerontological research proves what is going to happen. Those folks are going to get sicker. They are going to land in the hospital where they need much more expensive care under what is called Part A of the Medicare program. 
   I see my friend from Minnesota. He and I have worked often on these issues. The Presiding Officer of the Senate handled the Social Security issues in the House. We know what needs to be done. We know it needs to  be done in a bipartisan way. We can only get important issues addressed in Washington, DC, if we work in a bipartisan way. That is what I have teamed up with Senator SNOWE for more than a year to do. 
   I hope, as I bring additional cases to the floor of the Senate and talk about the extraordinary suffering we are seeing among our seniors, that we can come together on a bipartisan basis to deal with this issue. I have spoken with Senator DASCHLE and Senator LOTT about it. I know Senator SNOWE is doing so as well. This is an issue to which every single Member of the Senate can point as an achievement if we come together and address it in a bipartisan way. 
   Towards that end, I intend to keep coming to this floor and describing these cases. I have believed since the days I was codirector of the Oregon Gray Panthers that this was an important issue to address. It becomes even more important by the day as these new drugs are key to keeping seniors well and keeping them from landing in the hospital and incurring greater expenses. 
   I hope seniors will take heed of this poster and send copies of their prescription drug bills to their Senators in Washington, DC, 20510. 
   I will keep coming to the floor of this body again and again urging bipartisan support on this issue. It is my top priority for this session, and it ought to be a top priority for every Senator. 
   I look forward to working with my colleagues to have this issue addressed in this session of Congress and give our older people meaningful relief from their prescription drugs bills. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, today, I am introducing the Internet Non-Discrimination Act. The central principle of this bill is that our tax policy should not discriminate against the most vibrant part of our nation's economy. The legislation would extend indefinitely the Internet Tax Freedom's Act's three-year moratorium on discriminatory taxes against the Internet and electronic commerce. I am pleased to be joined in this effort by Senators ABRAHAM and LEAHY. 
   Three years ago, when Congressman CHRIS COX and I introduced the Internet Tax Freedom Act (ITFA), we said you can't squeeze the new economy into a set of rules written for smokestack industry. At that time, opponents predicted that retailers would vanish from Main Streets across America. Transcripts from hearings held on the legislation in the summer of 1997 are replete with opponents' predictions that a parade of horribles would be visited on every small merchant in every town in the United States. I am pleased to report that none of the horribles has come to pass. 
   In fact, this is what has happened in the 15 months since the Internet Tax Freedom Act was passed by the Senate 98-2 and became law.  
   States and localities have continued to collect sales and use taxes, and state budgets ended fiscal l999 with a $35 billion surplus. In California--one of the most wired states--1999 sales tax collections are up 20 percent over 1998. 
   Traditional bricks and mortar retailers had one of their best holiday seasons, recording a nearly 8% jump in sales over the previous year. 
   A recent survey of 1,500 Main Street businesses nationwide found that 74 percent have gone online since l997. 
   E-commerce has become part of the retail landscape, but still accounts for only \3/10\s of one percent of total retail sales. 
   States with the highest level of Internet use are also those with some of the largest gains in tax revenues. 
   It is clear to me that while state and local tax collectors sat wringing their hands, America's merchants were working on web pages. Main Street merchants seized the opportunity to expand their sales to new markets by going online. They also recognized the efficiencies of conducting their business-to-business transactions online. Rather than weaken Main Street merchants, the Internet has strengthened them. Rather than drain state and local tax coffers, the technological neutrality of the Internet Tax Freedom Act allowed online business to grow and state and local authorities to continue to collect lawful, nondiscriminatory taxes. The technological neutrality of the ITFA contributed to the rapid transformation of a bricks and mortar economy into a clicks and mortar economy. 
   I want the success of the bricks and clicks economy to continue, but consumers and businesses need some certainty. They need to know they won't have to start paying new taxes targeted specifically at e-commerce when the current moratorium expires in October 2001. That's why the ban on discriminatory taxes against the Internet and e-commerce should be made permanent. 
   The Internet Non-Discrimination Act we are introducing today will do just that. It continues the policy of technological neutrality. It allows state and local tax authorities to continue to collect lawful, nondiscriminatory sales or use taxes on online sales. It will give the governors time to see if they can move forward with their technological fix for collecting remote sales and use tax--a voluntary plan which will require the cooperation of every business in this nation, from Bandon, Oregon to Bangor, Maine. And, finally, it extends permanently a policy that has worked well for the last 15 months and under which consumers, businesses and state and local tax collectors have lived--and thrived. 
   In about two months the Advisory Commission on Electronic Commerce will issue its final report. After having talked yesterday with the Chairman of the Commission, Virginia Governor James Gilmore, I am hopeful that the Commission will endorse the approach we are taking in this bill. 
   If Congress does not act this year to extend the technologically neutral policy that is at the heart of the Internet Non-Discrimination Act, consumers and businesses will face thousands of tax authorities in this country jumping into their pockets when the current moratorium expires in October 2001. Consumers and businesses want certainty that they won't suddenly be facing an onslaught of new, confusing and discriminatory taxes.

   Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I commend our colleague from Michigan for a very important amendment which I think has one central point. Pass the Levin amendment and we will end the legal gymnastics that gun manufacturers have used to dodge their responsibilities. Pass the Levin amendment and the U.S. Senate sends a clear and simple message to these gun manufacturers that have played games with bankruptcy. Our message is the game is over. There is absolutely no reason to allow fraudulent activity by gun manufacturers to go without sanction. I am very troubled as I read through the history of what my colleagues have talked about--the Senator from Illinois and the Senator from Massachusetts-- 
   what it says about the nature of this debate. There are gun manufacturers who are actually bragging that they are taking advantage of the system when they know they cannot win on the merits. 
   We have a situation where as we debate the bankruptcy law and talk about making sure it is fair to all sides--good people may have fallen on hard times--and at the same time sensitive to the needs of business and others who otherwise wouldn't be able to get the funds they need that are so central in a marketplace kind of system, all of those people, it seems to me, end up without the treatment they deserve. They are, in effect, put in an unfavorable light when, in fact, the gun manufacturers are given a free ride. 
   Let us make sure that everybody is treated fairly--small businesses that have these claims, and many people we are seeing who have fallen on hard times and need a fresh start. But let us not send the worst possible message, which is that if you engage in the kind of reprehensible conduct my colleagues have documented, in effect, you will get a free ride if you are a gun manufacturer. 
   It is important to vote for this bankruptcy legislation. I voted for it last year, as did 96 of my colleagues. It is important to ensure that we have fairness for all parties. 
   Unless the Levin amendment is adopted, it seems to me that we allow a continuation of these legal gymnastics that are being practiced by gun manufacturers. That is wrong. 
   I urge my colleagues to support the Levin amendment.

   Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I intend to take a few minutes this afternoon to talk about the prescription drug issue for senior citizens. As many of our colleagues know, I have made it clear that I am going to come to the floor repeatedly between now and the end of the session in the hope we will get a bipartisan piece of legislation through this body that will meet the needs of so many vulnerable older people. 
   In the past, I have come to the floor and have read two or three of the cases I have been getting from seniors across the country. A lot of these older people, when they are finished paying their prescription drug bills, have only a few hundred dollars a month on which to live. Picture that: After you have paid your prescription drug bill, you pay for your food, your rent and utilities, and you have virtually nothing left over. 
   I think it is extremely important this Congress pass legislation to meet those needs. I have teamed up for more than a year with Senator OLYMPIA SNOWE from Maine. We have a bill that is market oriented. It would avoid some of the cost-shifting problems that we might see with other approaches. We want to make sure that as we help senior citizens, we do not have to cost shift it over to somebody who is, say, 27 or 28 and just getting started with a family and having trouble with their own medical bills. The Snowe-Wyden legislation avoids that kind of approach. 
   The reason I am taking a moment to speak this afternoon is because the comments made by the President last week at the State of the Union Address opened up a very wide berth for the Congress to address this issue in a bipartisan way. Prior to the President's comments, I know there was widespread concern by a variety of groups as to what he would say about the issue and how he would say it. 
   What the President of the United States said in the State of the Union Address on this issue of prescription drugs seems to me to capture our challenge. 
   First and foremost, the President made it very clear he is aware that in every nook and cranny of this country there are scores of senior citizens who cannot afford their medicine. They simply cannot afford it. His remarks spoke to the millions of older people in this country who walk on an economic tightrope; every month they balance their food bill against their fuel bill and their fuel bill against their medical costs. 
   After the President described this great need, he did not get into any of the particulars of writing a bill. He made it clear he wanted to work with the Congress to get a bipartisan piece of legislation that will meet the needs of older people. 
   Yes, he has his approach. His approach--and I am not going to get into all of the fairly complicated details--involves a role for what are called pharmacy benefit managers, PBMs. 
   The Snowe-Wyden legislation that has been proposed takes a slightly different approach. We use private entities which, in effect, will have to compete for the senior citizens' business. 
   We think that makes sense as a way to hold down the costs of medicine for older people because it has worked for Members of Congress. The Snowe-Wyden legislation is modeled after the health care system to which Members of Congress belong. 
   I have been asked again and again whether you could reconcile the President's approach, in terms of using pharmacy benefit managers, and the kind of approach that is taken in the Snowe-Wyden legislation, with these private entities that would have to compete for senior citizens' businesses. I think it is possible to reconcile these two approaches. I think we are making a lot of headway now in terms of addressing this issue, in terms of the parties saying the need is urgent. 
   We have to come together, in a bipartisan way, to do it. The President opened up a real opportunity for the Congress to come together on this matter. 
   The reason it is so important, of course, is that we cannot afford, as a nation, not to cover prescription medicine. I repeat that. People ask if we can afford to cover prescription drugs for older people. The reality is, our country cannot afford not to cover prescription drugs. 
   A lot of these drugs today are preventive in nature. They reduce problems related to blood pressure and cholesterol. I have talked a number of times on the floor about the anticoagulant drugs which prevent strokes. Perhaps it would cost $1,000 a year to meet the needs of an older person's prescriptions for these anticoagulant drugs. Sure, $1,000 or $1,500 is a lot of money, but if you have a legislative opportunity to help an older person in that way, and you save $100,000, which you can do because those drugs help to prevent strokes--and strokes can be very expensive, even upwards of $100,000--that is something our country should not pass up. 
   The elderly in this country get hit with a double whammy when it comes to pharmaceuticals. 
   First, Medicare does not cover prescription drugs. It has been that way since the program began in 1965. I do not know a soul who studied the Medicare program, who, if they were designing it today, would not cover prescription drugs simply for the reasons I have given, that they are preventive in nature. 
   The other part of the double whammy for older people is that the big buyers--the health maintenance organizations, the health plans, a variety of these big organizations--are able to get discounts; and then when an old person, a low-income older person, walks into a pharmacy, in effect, they have to pay a premium because the big buyers get the discounts. 
   So this is an important issue for the Congress to address. 
   As I have done in the past, I want to put into perspective exactly what so many of these vulnerable people are facing in our country. 
   I see our friend from Michigan. I want to make sure he has time as well. Democrats have a few more minutes. I want to make sure my colleague can be heard, as well. 
   But one of the cases I want to touch on this afternoon follows a 65-year-old senior from West Linn, OR. He wrote me recently as part of the campaign I have organized to have older people send in their bills. He wrote me that he used to have prescription drug coverage when he was working. Now he has no coverage at all. He is taking medication for high blood pressure, for high cholesterol, for heart-related problems. He 
   had triple bypass surgery in 1991 and anticipates he is going to be taking medications for the rest of his life. 
   He found that, as he tried to shop for medicines, the cost was 18 percent higher than when he had insurance coverage, which illustrates the double whammy that I described. 
   When he was in the workforce--and the Senator from Michigan knows a lot about this as a result of the company-retiree packages that autoworkers and others have--the workers were in a position to get a bargain. But then that senior retired and lost the opportunity to have some leverage in the marketplace. That senior in West Linn found that his prescription prices were 18 percent higher. 
   This person from West Linn has written, saying he hopes the bipartisan Snowe-Wyden legislation is successful. 
   We have received scores and scores of other letters. Because my friend from Michigan is here, and I want to allow him time to talk, I am going to wrap up only by way of saying that the last case I was going to go into in more detail is an older woman in eastern Oregon, just outside Pendleton, OR, who told me during the last recess that when she is done paying her prescription drug bill, she has only $200 a month on which to live for the rest of the month. 
   Perhaps other people can figure out some sort of financial sleight of hand  so they can get by on a couple hundred dollars a month for their food and utilities and housing, and the like, but that is not math that I think adds up. 
   We need to address this issue in a bipartisan way. The Snowe-Wyden legislation does that. I was particularly encouraged by the President's remarks last week on prescription drugs because I think, through the conciliatory approach that he took, making it clear that he wants to work with all parties to get this addressed, we now have a window to climb through to get the job done and provide a real lifeline to millions of older people. That is some good news for our country. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, I rise today in recognition of National Biotechnology Month. Biotechnology has produced drugs that hold the promise for many to live healthier lives. Biotechnology also holds enormous promise to make even more profound contributions to public health in the future. 
   For example, biotechnology strategies include the development of cancer vaccines as well as drugs that target specific cancer antigens to stimulate a patient's own immune system to kill tumor cells. There are so many other diseases that devastate families, like Alzheimers and heart disease, which biotechnology could be applied to successfully. 
   The Federal government has increased funding for basic scientific research. Private sector investments and small business development should also be encouraged. As remarkable as some of its achievement so far, biotechnology is only beginning. It is appropriate to begin the 21st Century with National Biotechnology Month because biotechnology holds so much promise for medicine and improving the quality of life.

   Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, we spend less than a quarter of our nation's education dollars to educate approximately half of our nation's students. You don't have to be a math whiz to know that the numbers just don't add up. 
   Thousands of rural and small schools across our nation face the daunting mission of educating almost half of America's children. Increasingly, these schools find that they are underfunded, overwhelmed, and overlooked. While half of the nation's students are educated in rural and small public schools, they only receive 23% of Federal education dollars; 25% of State education dollars; and 19% of Local education dollars. 
   We all grew up thinking that the three R's were Reading, Writing, and Arithmetic. Unfortunately for our rural school children, the three R's are too often run-down classrooms, insufficient resources, and really over-worked teachers. 
   Increasingly, Mr. President, rural and small schools are plagued by disparities connected to their geographic location and limited enrollment. To top it off, rural and small schools face shrinking local tax bases, higher transportation costs associated with the greater distance students must travel to school, and crumbling school buildings that may not have air conditioning, hot water, or roofs that do not leak. 
   Rural school districts and schools also find it more difficult to attract and retain qualified administrators and certified teachers. Consequently, teachers in rural schools are almost twice as likely to provide instruction in two or more subjects than their urban counterparts. Rural teachers also tend to be younger, less experienced, and receive less pay than their urban and suburban counterparts. Worse yet, rural school teachers are less likely to have the high quality professional development opportunities that current research strongly suggests all teachers desperately need. 
   Limited resources also mean fewer course offerings for students in rural and small schools. Consequently, courses are designed for the kids in the middle. So, students at either end of the academic spectrum miss out. Additionally, fewer rural students who dropout ever return to complete high school, and fewer rural higher school graduates go on to college. 
   On another note, recent research on brain development clearly shows the critical nature of early childhood education, yet rural schools are less likely to offer even kindergarten classes, let alone earlier educational opportunities. Limited resources also mean less support for teacher training, technical assistance, educational technologies, and school libraries. 
   To make matters worse, many of our rural areas are also plagued by persistent poverty, and, as we know, high-poverty schools have a much tougher time preparing their students to reach high standards of performance on state and national assessments. Data from the National Assessment of Educational Progress consistently show large gaps between the achievement of students in high-poverty schools and students in low-poverty schools. 
   Our bill would provide funding to approximately 3,400 rural and small school districts that serve 4.6 million students--a short-term infusion of funds that will allow these schools and their students to take substantial strides forward. 
   Local education agencies would be eligible for REDI funding if they are either ``rural'' (serve a non-metropolitan area) and have a school-age population (ages 5-17) with 20 percent or more of whom are from families with incomes below the poverty line; or ``small'' (student population of 800 or less) and a student population (ages 5-17) with 20 percent or more of whom are from families with incomes below the poverty line. 
   Like the Education Flexibility Act of 1999 (Ed-flex) I authored with Senator BILL FRIST earlier this Congress, REDI is voluntary--states and school districts could choose to participate in the program. Both Ed-flex and REDI are designed to provide states and districts with the flexibility they need in order to use funding to deal with their local priorities. 
   I've heard it said that this would be the Education Congress, but we have much to do before we earn that title. Ed-flex was a good start, but it was a start, not a finish. It's time to show  that we when it comes to education, we won't leave anyone behind, and REDI will give poor, rural children a real chance. We can't afford to stop now.

   Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, before Senator REED leaves the floor, I wish to commend my colleague from Rhode Island for all of his leadership on this issue. I was proud to join him as one Member of this body on the brief. He has consistently talked about the need to drain the swamp that has become America's system of financing campaigns. I share his view. 
   I note also Senator HOLLINGS is here as well. Senator HOLLINGS I think is absolutely right as well in saying that we probably ought to have a constitutional amendment to ensure we have comprehensive campaign finance reform. But the good news is that the Supreme Court today opened a window for meaningful reform opportunities and meaningful reform legislation. 
   I commend my colleague from Rhode Island for all of his leadership.

   Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I will be brief this afternoon. I note Senator HOLLINGS is here and also Senator GRAMS. 
   I come to the floor because last fall I indicated that I would come to the floor of the Senate again and again until this body passed bipartisan legislation to make sure the Nation's older people secure prescription drug coverage under Medicare. We have had some very exciting developments on this issue in recent days. I think all the work that has been put in by so many parties is beginning to pay off. 
   I think the reason there is such intense interest in this issue is that while Medicare provides important health insurance coverage for older people, its coverage still today has many gaps. In particular, it doesn't cover prescription medicine. 
   There is not anyone I know today--Democrat or Republican--who would argue that if we are going to redesign Medicare now, we would leave prescription drugs out. Quite the contrary. Virtually everyone who has studied this issue believes prescription drug coverage is absolutely critical because today's medicines are key to keeping older people well. The drugs of the future are going to help lower blood pressure and cholesterol. 
   I cited on the floor of the Senate the important anticoagulant medicines. If you spend perhaps $1,000 or $1,500 in a year, you can prevent stroke. If an older person suffers a stroke as a result of not having access to those medicines, they could incur expenses of $100,000 or more. So the need is intense. 
   This is an issue that must be addressed in a bipartisan way. For many months now, there has been a bipartisan effort in the Senate. Senator SNOWE and I have teamed up on legislation which we believe, using marketplace principles, addresses many of the concerns Senators on both sides of the aisle have had. It doesn't contain price controls or a sort of one-size-fits-all approach. 
   We would allow for a tobacco tax to finance the program. We don't require one. We say that it would be possible to finance the program using the general fund. But 54 Members of the Senate, a majority of the Senate, voted for the SNOWE-WYDEN funding plan for prescription drug coverage for older people. We now have a majority of the Senate in a recorded vote saying they would be willing to pay the dollars needed for a good prescription drug benefit for older people. 
   Our approach in the Snowe-Wyden legislation focuses on making these drugs accessible and affordable. Right now Medicare, of course, doesn't cover prescriptions. But just as importantly, older people, when they can afford their medicine, and go to a drugstore are, in effect, having to subsidize the big buyers--the HMOs and the health plans that can negotiate discounts. 
   In effect, the older people are getting shellacked twice when it comes to this issue of prescription drugs. They get no coverage. They have to subsidize the benefits, in effect, of those who have real bargaining power--those who are on the health plans.  
   I would like to wrap up with a couple of minutes on an issue that I know is important to South Carolina and in Minnesota, as well as my home State of Oregon. That is the plight of rural older people. There has been some discussion of 
   this prescription drug issue, of course, on the floor of the Senate, but never before has there been a focus on the special needs of older people in rural communities. 
   In my State--and I know in the States of Senator HOLLINGS and Senator GRAMS as well--if you live in a rural community, you have fewer physicians available to write medications. You have fewer pharmacies so that medication is not accessible. You have to drive longer distances in order to get your medicine. 
   We found, according to the Oregon Health Sciences University's Office of Rural Health, that a conservative number of seniors in rural Oregon who live in poverty is 16,500. I can tell you, having gone through many of those rural communities during the break, that there is a special need for coverage for prescription drugs for older people in rural communities. 
   I will wrap up by reading a few of the accounts older people from rural Oregon have sent me about the problems they are having in affording their medicine. An elderly couple, for example, in Baker City depending solely on Social Security takes prescription drugs for chronic back ailments. After they purchase their monthly medication, they have only $200 for that month left over to pay for their necessities. 
   They wrote me, and I am going to quote: ``..... that is not living, that is existing.'' 
   I think all of us know you cannot live on $200 a month. Yet that is what an older couple in Baker City, OR, are faced with after they finish paying for their prescription medicine. 
   In Clatsop County, after an older couple paid for their supplemental coverage, they had to spent $450 a month on their prescription medicine. They fear their supplemental insurance premium is going to go up again this year. That is always the case. They are then going to have to stop taking their medication altogether. 
   In Coos County, a 75-year-old female resident is getting by on a fixed income of about $800 a month. Every single month she is spending more than 25 percent of her monthly income on prescription medicine. 
   One older woman in that county lives on Social Security and doesn't have any prescription drug coverage at all. She is now at the point where she cannot afford spending the necessary $200 a month for her medications. 
   Before I came to Congress, I tried to specialize in the gerontology field. As sure as night follows day, when we have a vulnerable older woman who cannot, in a cold Oregon winter, afford to take her medications, she is going to get much sicker. Very often she will end up in the hospital needing extensive medical services that are available under what is called Part A of the Medicare program, the institutional program. 
   We ask: Can we afford to cover prescription drug medicine? That example I just gave of the older woman in Coos County makes it very clear this country cannot afford not to cover prescription drugs for older people under Medicare. If older folks do not get these medications, they are going to get sick and the medical bills will be far higher.

   Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I will come to the floor of this Senate again and again and again these next few months to urge bipartisan action on this issue. The Snowe-Wyden legislation is one approach. Certainly, our colleagues will have other good ideas. There are a variety of ways this issue can be addressed in a bipartisan way. I am pleased our approach garnered 54 votes when it came to actually paying for it. 
   I intend, with Senator SNOWE, to continue to urge older people to send in copies of their prescription drug bills to each Member in the Senate in Washington, DC, so we can read their personal accounts into the RECORD.

   Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, for the past several years, Congress has been working in a bipartisan way to write the rules of the digital economy. We have made significant progress on Internet taxes, privacy, encryption and the Y2K problem. Now is the time to move forward on rules for electronic signatures. 
   The bill before us today, S. 761, is based on the premise that it's better to be online than waiting in line. A growing number of Americans who now have to wait in line for things like a driver's license or construction permit, could see their business expedited by a few clicks of their mouse. 
   We live in an increasingly mobile society, where young people get recruited for jobs clear across the country. They may need to move in a hurry but don't have the time, for example, to pack up a home in Virginia and look for another one in Portland, Oregon. With the Internet, they can shop for a house in another town. With this electronic signatures bill, they can pretty much conclude the whole transaction of purchasing the house online. 
   The legislation puts electronic and paper contracts and agreements on equal footing legally. Like the Internet Tax Freedom Act, the bill would establish technological neutrality between electronic and paper contracts and agreements. This means consumers will enjoy the same legal protections when purchasing a car or home online as when they walk into an auto dealership or real estate office and sign all the documents in person. We worked long and hard to make sure that the system established here benefits consumers who wish to receive information electronically without treating those without computers as second class citizens. 
   This legislation does not address the issue of electronic records because this matter deserves more thorough study and discussion. I intend to work with all interested parties on this--from consumer groups to financial services firms--over the course of the coming months to craft legislation that will extend the benefits of this measure to electronic records in a way that continues consumer protections. 
   Commercial transactions have traditionally been governed by State laws which are modeled on the Uniform Commercial Code. Forty-two states have some law in place relating to digital authentication. But differences between and among these laws can create confusion for e-entrepreneurs. The unstoppable growth of electronic commerce has led the States recently to develop a Uniform Electronic Transactions Act, or UETA (as part of the Uniform Commercial Code), to serve as a model for each State legislature in developing further its own electronic signatures law. However, only one State--California--has enacted a UETA. The purpose of this legislation is to provide interim Federal legal validity for electronic contracts and agreements until each state enacts its own UETA. This means e-commerce will not be hamstrung by the lack of legal standing. 
   I would like to take a minute to run through the highlights of S. 761: 
   Technological neutrality: It allows electronic signatures to replace written signatures. In interstate commerce a contract cannot be denied legal effect solely because of an electronic signature, electronic record or an electronic agent was used in its formation. 
   Choice of technology: It does not dictate the type of electronic signature technology to be used; it allows the parties to a transaction to choose their own authentication technology. 
   Consumer protections: It protects consumer rights under State laws; it does not preempt State consumer protection laws. It assures that consumers without a computer are not treated as second class citizens. If a consumer buys a car online, the consumer cannot be forced to use the computer to receive important recall or safety notices but retains the option to continue to get such notices through the mail. 
   No State preemption: Its provisions sunset when a State enacts UETA. 
   Excludes matters of family law: It specifically excludes agreements relating to marriage, adoption, premarital agreements, divorce, residential landlord-tenant matters because these are not commercial transactions. 
   Report on Federal statutory barriers to electronic transactions: It requires OMB to report to Congress 18 months after enactment identifying statutory barriers to electronic transactions and recommending legislation to remove such barriers. 
   In conclusion, M. President, I wish to acknowledge the leadership of Sen. ABRAHAM in moving this legislation forward. He and I have teamed up successfully on other legislation, and it was a pleasure to work with him and his tireless staff on this bill. I also want to recognize the contribution of Senator LEAHY, particularly with regard to the consumer protection provisions, as well as the effort of Senator HOLLINGS. It took a bipartisan team to get this bill through the Senate today, and I look forward to continuing to work with this team as we go to conference with the House on S. 761.

   Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I have come to the floor of the Senate on a number of occasions recently to talk about the issue of prescription drugs for the elderly. 
   I think there is a particularly relevant point to make this afternoon given the very extensive press coverage we have seen on this issue in recent days. 
   Over the weekend, David Rosenbaum in the New York Times had an excellent article on the issue. In the last couple of days, Time magazine had another very lengthy piece on the question of prescription drugs for seniors. And both of these articles ultimately make the point that Congress probably is not going to be able to agree on legislation during this session. The authors offer considerable skepticism about the ability of Congress to come together on a very difficult issue. Both of them, to some extent, go off into what I think are secondary questions--the questions of the role of the Internet, and the question of patents on drugs. Those are important matters. 
   But what is central and what the Congress needs to do on a bipartisan basis is pass legislation that would make it possible for frail and vulnerable older people to get insurance coverage that would provide for their medicine. 
   For example, if you are an elderly widow who is 78, maybe having early signs of Alzheimer's, and you spend more than half of your combined monthly income of Social Security and pension on prescription medicine--those are the kinds of letters that seniors are sending to me--it is not going to help you a whole lot to get a 10- or 15-percent discount because you shop over the Internet. Certainly, the role of the Internet in prescription drugs is going to be important. There will be a 
   lot of issues. But to provide relief for the Nation's older people, what Congress needs to do on a bipartisan basis is pass legislation that provides insurance coverage making it possible for older people to pay these big bills. Patent issues and the question of the Internet are matters that are important, but what is needed is legislation that provides real relief. 
   Part of the effort to win bipartisan support for prescription drug legislation is coming to this floor and, as the poster says, urging seniors to send in copies of their prescription drug bills. Send them to each of us here in the Senate in Washington, DC. 
   I intend to keep coming to the floor of the Senate and actually reading from these letters. I have three today that I think tell an important story. 
   One is from a senior citizen in Medford, OR, in my home State. Another is from a senior citizen from Grants Pass, OR, and a third is from a senior citizen in O'Brien, OR, all of which reflect the kind of concerns I know are out there. Hopefully, as seniors learn about our campaign and see that we are urging them to send us copies of their prescription drug bills, it can help bring about bipartisan support for legislation in the Senate. 
   I am very proud that I have been able to team up in recent months with Senator OLYMPIA SNOWE on bipartisan legislation. I have been of the view that nothing more can happen in Washington, DC, unless it is bipartisan. The Snowe-Wyden legislation is a bill that uses marketplace forces and unleashes the forces of the private sector in an effort to make medicine more affordable for the Nation's older people. 
   What is sad is that our elderly are in effect hit by a double whammy. Millions of them can't afford their prescriptions. Medicare doesn't cover medicine. It hasn't since the program began in 1965. 
   On top of the fact that seniors don't have Medicare coverage, when they walk into a pharmacy--I see our friend from New Hampshire, our colleague who has a great interest in health care. As he knows, when a senior walks into a drugstore in New Hampshire, Oregon, or Kentucky, and can't pay for their prescription medicine, in addition they are subsidizing the big buyers of prescription drugs. The HMOs and the health care plans are in a position to negotiate a discount. They get a break on their prices. The seniors, people who are spending half their monthly income on prescriptions, are, in effect, subsidizing those big buyers. 
   The bipartisan Snowe-Wyden legislation, fortunately, has been able to generate a lot of interest in the Senate. Senator SNOWE and I are proud to have the support. 
   For example, more than 54 Members of the Senate--more than half the Senate--are now on record saying they would support a tobacco tax to pay for prescription drug benefits for older people. 
   That strikes me as appropriate. 
   Medicare spent more than $12 billion last year picking up the costs of tobacco-related illnesses, and more than 50 Members of the Senate are now on record as saying they would be willing to support additional funding to help the vulnerable seniors from whom we are hearing. 
   Let me read a little bit from some of these letters because I think they sum it up. One I received in the last couple of days from Grants Pass says:  
   No way can I afford to pay for my medicine. I did get a refill on Pepcid.  
   That is an important medication this elderly woman is taking now in Grants Pass, OR.   
   I do hope you can do something to help us seniors.  
   When she writes, ``No way can I afford to pay for my medicine,'' that essentially sums it up. 
   We can talk about people buying prescription drugs over the Internet; we can talk about the patent issue, both involving substantial sums of money. Whatever that person needs in Grants Pass--and the letter goes on to say she has no insurance coverage for her medicine--seniors need legislation that actually provides coverage through the insurance system to help pay for prescription drugs. 
   Another letter comes from Medford, OR. We can see the stack of bills going to a pharmacy in Medford, Southern Oregon Health Trust Pharmacy. This individual has spent $1,664 recently on prescription drugs in Medicare. She is sending bills to our office. Unfortunately, she doesn't get any help through the various insurance coverages she has. This is representative of what we have been hearing. She also goes on to point out that this large stack of bills she sent me does not even include some of the over-the-counter drugs she is taking such as ibuprofen. 
   These cases illustrate very well why our country cannot afford not to cover prescription medicine. All of these articles, including Time magazine, are always questioning whether the Nation can afford to cover prescription medicine. I have contended for some time now we cannot afford not to cover prescription medicine. These bills I have been reading from on the floor of the Senate show seniors can't afford drugs that help to lower cholesterol, help to lower their blood pressure. These are drugs that help older people to stay well. 
   Prescription drug coverage for seniors has been a priority ever since my days with the Gray Panthers before I was elected to Congress. Frankly, it is much more important today than ever because these drugs that so many seniors write that they cannot afford today help seniors to stay well. The variety of anticoagulant drugs that help to prevent strokes, as I have commented on the floor of the Senate in the past, might cost $1,000 a year for an older person to buy them to stay healthy. Compare that to the costs incurred if a senior suffers a stroke. If a senior cannot get an anticoagulant drug to help stay healthy and avoid a stroke, that senior might incur expenses of more than $100,000. 
   The question for the Senate is, Are we going to help frail and vulnerable seniors with prescription drug coverage that will cost just a fraction of the expenses that will be incurred through Medicare Part A, the hospital portion, and Medicare Part B, the outpatient portion, if the senior cannot get help and ends up getting sick and, very often, incurring extraordinary 
   expenses? 
   The third letter I read comes from a woman in O'Brien, OR. She has spent more than $2,000 through November of 1999 on her prescription drugs, and just in recent days she has taken on a job in hopes she will be able to pay for her prescriptions. She is 78 years old. At present, she has her Social Security and Medicare. She now has taken on a small job in hopes she will have the funds to pay for her prescription medicine. She writes that she hopes the Snowe-Wyden legislation becomes law. 
   Other colleagues have different approaches. We appreciate that. What is important is we move forward together. Let's show the authors of all these recent articles in Time magazine, in the New York Times, and various other publications that are skeptical about whether the Congress can tackle a big issue such as this; let's prove them wrong. Let's show, in spite of a fairly polarized political climate in America today, when there is an important program, this Congress can come together. 
   I will keep coming to the floor and urging seniors to send in copies of their prescription drug bills. The poster lays it out: Send their bills to their Senator in Washington, DC. The Snowe-Wyden legislation, SPICE, for the Senior Prescription Insurance Coverage Equity Act, is a bill that, on a bipartisan basis, can be supported in the Senate. If other colleagues have different ideas, let's get them out on the table. Let's come up with a marketplace approach to holding down the costs of medicine. 
   These bills show access to coverage is very key, but holding down the costs of medicine is very key as well. There is a right way and a wrong way to hold down those costs. The right way is to use a model such as the health care system for Members of Congress. That is what is behind the Snowe-Wyden legislation that provides choice, competition, and marketplace forces for holding down medicine. 
   There is a wrong way--the various approaches that call for price controls. The real danger behind price controls is that the costs for anybody who is not in the price control group will be shifted on to other Americans who are having difficulty paying for medicines as well. It would not be a particularly useful thing for the Senate to come up with a price control regime for folks on Medicare and then have the costs shifted over to a divorced woman who is 27 years old with two children who is working her head off to try to help her family and help them pay for expenses and then her bills would go up because costs would be shifted to her. 
   I intend to keep coming back to the floor of the Senate and reading from these bills. Today I have read accounts from Medford, from Grants Pass, and from O'Brien. Seniors cannot afford today to cover prescription drugs. 
   When public opinion polls are taken, coverage of prescription drugs for older people is now one of the top two or three concerns in America--not just for seniors but for all Americans; certainly for the sandwich generation. Perhaps a young couple in their forties who have to try to provide some assistance to a parent who could not afford prescription medicine is following this issue. It is not just a seniors' issue; it is an issue for families; it is an issue for the quality of life of our country. 
   The Snowe-Wyden legislation is a bipartisan bill where more than 50 Senators have already indicated they will support the funding mechanism in prescription drug coverage as one way to proceed. 
   I am sure our colleagues have other ways to go. But what is important is to show the skeptics across this country who are writing in magazines and saying in news reports that nothing can be done that we can come together on a bipartisan basis and provide real relief for the Nation's older people. 
   I hope seniors will, as this poster indicates, continue to send copies of their prescription drug bills to us in the Senate, each of us in Washington, DC, because I intend to keep coming back to this floor again and again until we can secure passage of this legislation. 
   I do not want to see the attention of the Senate diverted to questions of the role of the Internet and patents and the variety of matters because, while they are important, they do not go to the heart of what is needed in this country. What is needed in America for the millions of seniors who are spending half of their income on prescription drugs--and that is what I have been describing on the floor of the Senate--is insurance coverage. They need coverage which will pick up that part of their insurance bill that goes for prescription drugs. That is what the Snowe-Wyden legislation does on a bipartisan basis. 
   We are going to keep coming back to the floor of this body to talk about the need for prescription drug coverage for the elderly. There are bipartisan proposals to do it. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I wanted to take a few minutes to talk, as I have on several occasions recently, about the issue of prescription drugs and the Nation's elderly. You certainly can't open up a major publication these days without reading about this issue. 
   The New York Times, on Sunday last, had an excellent article. Time magazine, which came out in the last couple of days, had a lengthy discussion of prescription drugs and seniors. These are all very captivating discussions, but almost all of them end with the author's judgment that nothing is going to get done in Congress about this critical issue. They go on and on for pages and, finally, the author winds around to the conclusion that this issue has been tied up in partisanship and the kind of bickering that you see so often in Washington, DC. There you have it. Case closed. Lots of arguing but no relief for the Nation's older people. Lots of politics but no results. 
   So what I have been trying to do, in an effort to break the gridlock on that issue, is to come to the floor of the Senate and talk specifically about a bipartisan piece of legislation, the Snowe-Wyden bill, which has received what amounts to a majority of Senators' support at this point because they have already voted for the funding plan that we envisage, and to talk about how the Senate could come forward with real relief for the Nation's older people and do it in a bipartisan way. 
   As part of the effort to break the gridlock, as this poster next to me indicates, I hope seniors will send to each of us copies of their prescription drug bills. As a result of seniors and their families being involved in this way, this will help to bring about a bipartisan effort in the Senate and actually win passage of the legislation and bring about relief for older people. 
   The Snowe-Wyden legislation is called the SPICE bill, the Senior Prescription Insurance Coverage Equity Act. It ought to be a subject Members of Congress know something about because the Snowe-Wyden bill is based on the Federal Employees Health Benefits Plan. It is not some alien, one-size-fits-all Federal price control regime but something that offers a lot of choice and alternatives and uses the forces of the marketplace to deliver good health care to Members of Congress and their families. 
   Senator SNOWE and I have essentially used that model for the approach that we want to take in delivering prescription drug benefits for the Nation's older people. Fifty-four Members of the Senate, as part of the budget resolution, said they would vote for a specific way to fund the legislation. What I have tried to do is come to the floor on a number of occasions recently and as a result of folks reading this poster and sending copies of their prescription drug bills to us individually in the Senate in Washington, DC, I hope to be able to show the need in our country is enormous and to help catalyze bipartisan action. 
   Tonight, in addition to reading briefly from some of the bills I have received in recent days, I am going to talk a little bit about how it is not going to be possible to solve this problem unless the approach the Senate devises, in addition to being bipartisan, addresses the question of affordable 
   insurance. For example, this Time magazine article that came out today--a very interesting and very thoughtful piece and I commend the author for most of what is written--talks about the role of the Internet. It says there are going to be a variety of proposals debated on the floor of the Senate. But with the Internet, people are going to just try to go out and buy prescription drugs and it goes into various details about how seniors can buy prescriptions on line. 
   I was director of the Gray Panthers at home in Oregon for about 7 years before I was elected to the Congress. Suffice it to say, I can assure you that some of the most frail and vulnerable older people in our country are not going to be able to buy their prescriptions on line the way Time magazine envisages. But perhaps even more important, if an older person is spending more than half of his or her Social Security check on prescription medicine--and I have given example after example in recent days of older people in our country, at home in our States. I am very pleased my friend and colleague, Senator SMITH, is in the chair because he has talked often about the need for bipartisan action on this issue to help seniors. 
   I think both of us would agree that if you have an older person who is spending more than half of their monthly income on prescription drugs--more than half of their Social Security checks, for example, and a lot of them get nothing but Social Security--those folks are going to need decent insurance coverage. They need to be in a position to get insurance coverage that will pick up a significant hunk of their prescription drug costs. 
   The Time magazine article tells you all about buying drugs over the Internet. But a lot of those senior citizens with an income of $11,000 or $12,000 a year--a modest income--when they are spending more than half of their income on prescription drugs are not going to find an answer on the Internet. They are going to need decent insurance coverage. 
   The Snowe-Wyden legislation envisages--is a detailed plan, it is a specific plan, a bipartisan plan, S. 1480--and lays out a system that involves marketplace choices and competitive forces in the private sector. Seniors will be in a position to have real clout when it comes to purchasing private insurance. 
   I think what is so sad about the situation with respect to our older people and prescription drugs is they get hit by a double whammy. Medicare doesn't cover prescription medicine. That is the way the program began back in the middle 1960s. 
   Second, a lot of the big buyers, health maintenance organizations, or a plan, can go out and negotiate a discount. And the senior who walks into a  pharmacy in our home State in Coos Bay or Beaverton or Pendleton or some part of our home State, ends up, in effect, paying a premium because the big buyers are able to negotiate discounts. 
   It is critical that seniors be in a position to get more affordable private insurance for their prescription medicine. 
   Under the Snowe-Wyden legislation for seniors on a modest income, other than a copayment or deductible, the legislation would pick up the entire part of that senior's insurance premium that covers prescription drugs. 
   That is something that will help that frail older person. It is not going to be the Internet that is going to be a panacea for that older person but legislation that helps that elderly widow or retired gentleman afford private insurance coverage is something that will be of help to them. That is what the Snowe-Wyden legislation is all about. 
   Tonight, I want to read from a few letters I have received in the last couple of days. And I will continue in the days ahead as the Senate wraps up--we hope it won't be too many more days ahead--to bring these kinds of cases to the floor of the Senate in an effort to try to see the Senate come together in a bipartisan way and provide some relief for older people. 
   One elderly couple, for example, wrote me about their medical situation, reporting that both had recently had heart surgery and one of them, in addition, had a stroke. They are taking blood-thinner drugs. They are taking important cholesterol-lowering drugs--Lipitor--and drugs for lowering blood pressure. They are breaking that particular medicine in half because they cannot afford their prescriptions, and then they are taking a drug which serves as an antidepressant. 
   This couple has a combined income of around $1,500 a month. For the month of October alone, they spent $888 on just the drugs I mentioned. Over half of their monthly income is going for prescription medicine. 
   I don't believe there is going to be relief for that elderly couple over the Internet. They are not going to be able to deal with that financial predicament where they spend over half of their monthly income on prescription medicine through some ``www'' opportunity on the Internet. They are going to need decent insurance coverage. 
   That is what the bipartisan Snowe-Wyden legislation tries to provide. 
   The second case I would like to touch on tonight comes from our home State. An elderly woman wrote me to report that in recent days she spent more than $800 on her prescription medicine. She writes: ``I'm on a fixed income. It's just getting harder and harder. Medicare help with prescriptions is a real need.'' 
   Finally, a third letter that I think sums up the kind of predicament that a lot of seniors in our State are facing comes from Beaverton where an elderly couple is trying to make ends meet essentially with just Social Security and a little bit of help from family. 
   When they are finished paying for their prescription drugs--this is an elderly couple in Beaverton, OR, in our home State--they have $107.40 left over to live for the month. 
   Just think about that. It is not an isolated kind of case. Think about what it has to be like for an older couple to have $107 left over for living after they have paid for their prescription medicine. 
   In the last sentence, this particular elderly woman just asked a question: ``Can you help?'' 
   I think that really sums it up. 
   I think the American people want to see if the Senate, instead of the usual tired routine of bickering and arguing and inaction, will produce a bipartisan plan to provide real relief. 
   What I find so striking, and why I am so proud to have teamed up with the Republican Senator from Maine on this bipartisan issue, is that when I am asked at home--I had a town meeting a couple of days ago on the Oregon coast. And the President often has the same kind of community session. I was asked about whether the Nation can afford to cover prescription medicine. 
   My answer is, if you are reading these bills, that America cannot afford not to cover prescription medicine because these drugs, as in the case I described initially, are drugs that keep people well. They help people deal with blood pressure. They help people deal with cholesterol. These are drugs to help keep people healthy. If you keep them healthy, they don't land in the hospital where they rack up those huge charges for Part A of Medicare. I cited repeatedly these anticoagulant medicines. 
   Evidence shows that for perhaps $1,000 a year, seniors could get a comprehensive program of anticoagulant medicines that can help prevent strokes. We have seen again and again that if you can't get this kind of preventive medical help and you incur a stroke, it costs more than $100,000 to pick up the cost. 
   That is really the choice, it seems to me, for the Senate. I think the Presiding Officer of the Senate and I have shown in our home States that it is possible on a whole host of issues, frankly, issues that a lot of people think are more divisive than even prescription medicine, to come together in a bipartisan way. I am hopeful the Senate can show that as well. We have seen one poll after another demonstrating that the American people want Congress to provide real relief. 
   In the last couple of weeks, I have seen several polls which indicate that helping frail and vulnerable seniors with prescription drug coverage through Medicare is one of the top two or three concerns for this country. 
   Instead of these articles that we are seeing coming out of Time magazine and New York Times and others saying we probably won't be finished, and there won't be an effective answer, I would like to see the Senate show we can really follow through and produce for the older people of this country. 
   In the days left of this session--we all hope there won't be many more--until we get comprehensive bipartisan legislation that provides the elderly real relief, I intend to keep coming to the floor of the Senate to talk about this issue. 
   I hope folks who are listening tonight will send in copies of their prescription drug bills. 
   This poster says it all: ``Send in your prescription drug bills.'' Send them to each of us in the Senate in Washington D.C. 
   I can tell you the bills that are coming into my office--they are really coming in now as a result of our taking the opportunity to discuss this issue on the floor of the Senate--say that this is an urgent need. 
   There are people who write who are conservative. There are people who write who are liberals, Democrats, Republicans, and 
   independents, and all across the political spectrum who say: Get the job done. We are not interested in the traditional bickering and fighting about who gets credit, whose turf is being invaded, and which particular parochial kind of issue is being placed ahead of the national wellbeing. 
   This Nation's seniors and this Nation's families want us to come together and deal with this issue. 
   I intend to come back on the floor of the Senate again and again until the Senate does. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I am introducing today legislation that will allow the Forest Service to sell an abandoned facility to the city of Bend, OR, to be used for recreational purposes. The idea for this legislation came from the citizens of Bend themselves. They worked with Forest Service personnel in the adjacent Deschutes National Forest and crafted a win-win solution to different problems. What others might have seen as a problem, namely the shutdown of the Pine Nursery facility, they saw as an opportunity--the opportunity to provide a recreational complex for the community and to generate funding for needed facilities in the Deschutes Forest. This legislation would allow them to implement this creative idea. 
   Faced with the inevitable sale, trade or development of the Forest Service's Bend Pine Nursery, which supplied seedlings for five decades of reforestation work, last spring I met with representatives from the Bend Metro Parks and Recreation District; the city of Bend; the Bend School District; folks from the soccer and Little League baseball programs; and others who are concerned about central Oregon's youth and adults having adequate recreational facilities. 
   What these folks asked me to do was very straightforward: if the Forest service is going to sell, exchange, or otherwise develop the former Bend Pine Nursery, the community wanted the opportunity to acquire the property for the development of a sports complex, playing fields and other facilities. 
   My bill simply creates an opportunity for the Bend Metro Parks and Recreation District to work with the people of Bend on whether or not to purchase this property. It does not require purchase by the community, it simply gives the community a right of first refusal to buy the property at fair market value. 
   At the same time, this legislation allows the Deschutes National Forest to address its need for a new administrative site. Currently, the Deschutes pays approximately $725,000 per year in annual lease and utility costs. This is 3/4 of a million dollars that is not being spent on the ground, improving the quality of Deschutes National Forest facilities, lands and resources. It is a credit to the leadership of the Deschutes National Forest that they seek a way out from this unnecessary, unproductive and recurring expense. 
   My bill will enable the Deschutes to use the money raised from the sale of the nursery and other surplus properties in Oregon toward the acquisition--and ownership--of a new administrative site. The cost of a new building is estimated to be about $7 million; as my colleagues can see, the forest is paying almost a million dollars in rent each year. In the words of an ad from today's ``Bend Bulletin'', and I quote: ``Tired of throwing away thousands on rent? Think you can't buy? think again. If you're stuck in the renter rut, try it our way.'' 
   I look forward to a hearing next year on this bill in the Energy and Natural Resources Subcommittee on Forests and Public Land Management, of which  I am ranking member. I welcome my colleague, Mr. SMITH, as an original cosponsor of this innovative bill

   Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, and colleagues, this is the time of the legislative session when too many important bills and nominations are killed in secret through a process known as the secret hold. This session of the Senate was supposed to be different as a result of an agreement between the majority and the minority leaders. I am going to read from that agreement. On February 25, Senator LOTT and Senator DASCHLE wrote all Senators:   
   All Members wishing to place a hold on any legislation or executive calendar business shall notify the sponsor of the legislation and the committee of jurisdiction of their concern. Further written notification should be provided to respective leaders stating their intentions regarding their bill or nomination. Holds placed on items by a member of a personal or committee staff will not be honored unless accompanied by a written notification from the objecting Senator by the end of the following business day.  
   Suffice it to say, colleagues, I suspect there are a few sponsors of legislation here in the Senate who have not been notified that there is a hold on their legislation. 
   I hope as we move towards the last hours of this session all Senators, Democrats and Republicans, will honor the policy set out by Senators LOTT and DASCHLE. The secret holds are a breach of all that the Senate is supposed to stand for in terms of openness and public accountability. 
   I hope Senators will comply with that new policy set out by Senators LOTT and DASCHLE. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I have been coming to the floor for a number  of days now in an effort to try to get a focus back on this prescription drug issue which seems to involve a lot of finger pointing and a lot of partisan bickering. As part of that effort, I have been urging seniors to send in copies of their prescription drug bills. Just as this poster says, the senior can send in a copy of the prescription drug bill, and write to each of us in the Senate here in Washington, DC. 
   I have been actually coming to the floor and reading some of these bills for a number of weeks. Just in the last couple of days, I heard from a woman in Portland--she is 84; she has diabetes and a heart condition. She has only Social Security to support herself. She is spending over a third of that Social Security check every month on prescription drugs. She is now at a point where it is hard to pay the taxes on her home. 
   I heard from another gentleman recently. He has a monthly Social Security check of $633. The cost of his drugs is $644 a month. He is spending more for his prescription drugs each month than he is actually getting in income. So every month this senior is having to choose between food and fuel and fuel and health care. So as a result of this effort to get from seniors copies of their prescription drug bills, we are hearing about the kind of suffering that seniors are enduring around this country. 
   Senator OLYMPIA SNOWE and I have a bipartisan prescription drug bill. It would cover all senior citizens on an ability-to-pay basis. More than 50 Senators of both political parties are now on record as supporting a funding plan for this legislation. I know other Senators have approaches they would like to try. What is important is that we get a bipartisan focus on this issue. Every public opinion poll shows seniors and families across this country are having difficulty making ends meet when it comes to the high cost of essential health care services. 
   Our approach is marketplace oriented. There are not price controls. It is not one size fits all. The Snowe-Wyden legislation is called SPICE, the Senior Prescription Insurance Coverage Equity Act. It is designed to deal with the double whammy our seniors are facing on their prescriptions. First, Medicare does not cover the drugs they need and, second, when a senior citizen walks into a drug store, in effect that senior is subsidizing the big buyers, the health maintenance organizations, and other health plans that are able to get discounts. 
   So seniors have this double whammy now in front of them when it comes to their prescriptions. I hope more will, as these posters indicate, send us copies of their prescription drug bills. I think on the basis of these bills that we are getting from seniors across the country--each of us in the Senate here in Washington, DC--we can bring about bipartisan support to actually respond to the needs of the seniors.

   Mr. WYDEN. Thank you, Mr. President. The Senator from West Virginia has been a great ally of the Nation's older people, and I very much appreciate his thoughtfulness. I believe my time is almost up. 
   I intend to keep coming to the floor of the Senate to read from these bills that we are getting from the Nation's senior citizens. We have 54 Members of the Senate already on record as having voted for a specific plan to fund a prescription drug benefit for older people. We can do this in a bipartisan way. We have the chairman of the Aging Committee, Senator GRASSLEY, who has led our efforts on the committee on so many issues. 
   I am going to keep coming back to the floor and read from these bills. Again and again, we are hearing from seniors who cannot afford important drugs such as their diabetes medicines. 
   I will wrap up by saying, when I am asked the question whether our Nation can afford prescription drug coverage, my response is we cannot afford not to cover prescriptions. 
   A lot of these drugs help seniors stay healthy, keep their blood pressure down, or help to reduce cholesterol. I have cited previously an anticoagulant drug. It costs senior citizens about $1,000 a year. With those kinds of medicines, we can help prevent strokes that involve expenses of more than $100,000. 
   I am going to keep coming back to this floor to focus on the needs of seniors. We ought to do this in a bipartisan way. That is what is behind the Snowe-Wyden legislation. A lot of our colleagues have other ideas for addressing this issue. 
   As this poster says, I hope seniors will continue to send copies of their prescription drug bills to us in the Senate, Washington, DC. 
   I will keep coming to this floor until we can get the bipartisan action we need that provides real relief for the Nation's older people. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, the newspapers of the Nation this weekend were filled with stories about the politics of prescription drug coverage for the Nation's elderly. One poll after another said that the question of covering prescription drugs for seniors was one of the top three concerns of millions of Americans--not just seniors, but people of all ages. And then, in addition to all the polls and surveys that were published this weekend, some of our most distinguished political journalists were out across the country interviewing people in America asking them what they thought about Congress' handling of the prescription drug issue. And one interview after another essentially has seniors and families responding that they could not figure out why the Congress in Washington, DC, could not tackle this issue in a bipartisan way. 
   I remember one of the interviewees in particular, in effect, saying, ``What are they so busy fussing about in Washington, DC, that they can't find the time to deal with an issue so important to millions of older people?'' I think that person who got interviewed pretty much summed it up. 
   I have been coming up to the floor of the Senate over the last 2 or 3 weeks in an effort to try to bring folks' attention, both in the Senate and in our country, that there is bipartisan legislation to cover the question of prescription drugs for older people, and to talk about why it is so important. As part of that effort, as you can see in the poster next to me, I have been urging that seniors send in copies of their prescription drug bills--actually send in copies of their prescription drug bills to those of us in the Senate in Washington, DC. I have been getting a great many of these bills. I have been coming to the floor on a number of occasions and actually reading from these bills because I think it helps to drive home what we saw in the newspapers all across the country this weekend, and that is that we have to come up with a bipartisan plan to meet these needs of vulnerable elderly people. 
   So tonight I am going to read from some of the letters that I am receiving from older people at home in Oregon. Four letters in particular struck me as particularly compelling in recent days. I have heard from folks in North Bend, Redmond, Roseburg, and Milwaukie in the metropolitan area of our State. All of them essentially make the same kind of case, and that is that so many seniors are walking on an economic tightrope. They are balancing food costs against the fuel costs and the fuel costs against their medical bills. With so many being unable to afford their prescriptions, they are writing and saying they can't afford to wait for another election, the 2000 election, to resolve this issue. They have been reading these articles with Members of Congress saying that it is too complicated to tackle now. It is too difficult to get a consensus. I just don't think that is the case. 
   There is a bipartisan bill now before the U.S. Senate. It is one that was drafted by the distinguished senior Senator from Maine, OLYMPIA SNOWE, and myself. We got 54 votes for it on the floor of the Senate. A majority of Members of the Senate voted in a specific way to fund the prescription drug benefit for the Nation's older people. So it is just not right to say that there is no consensus, there is no way to bring Senators of both political parties together on this issue. It is just factually wrong. Fifty-four Members of the  Senate have said that they would vote for a specific approach to funding a drug benefit for the Nation's older people, and it was a bipartisan vote. It wasn't done in the dead of night. It was part of the budget debate. A majority in the Senate is now on record. 
   It is a plan that I think unleashes the forces of the marketplace. It is built on the model from which Members of Congress get their health care, the Federal Employees Health Benefits Plan. It is called the SPICE Program, the Senior Prescription Insurance Coverage Equity Act. It gives seniors the kind of bargaining power that some of these big purchasers such as the health maintenance organizations have. 
   Right now, seniors with prescriptions get hit by sort of a double whammy. 
   First, Medicare doesn't cover prescriptions. It hasn't since the program began in 1965. 
   Second, when a senior citizen walks into a drugstore, walks into their neighborhood pharmacy, in effect that senior has to pay a premium for their prescription drugs because the big buyers actually get discounts. 
   You have these health care plans. You have health maintenance organizations. You have the big buyers going out and negotiating discounts. Then senior citizens walk into the pharmacy in their community in effect having to pay a premium and in effect subsidizing the big buyers in town who get these discounts. 
   I am often asked whether our country can afford to cover prescription drugs for the Nation's older people. My response is that America can't afford not to cover these prescription drugs because so many of these drugs at this time are essentially ones that help keep older people well. They help keep them healthy--lower blood pressure, deal with cholesterol problems--and keep seniors from getting sick and landing in the hospital where they need very expensive services from what is called the Part A program of Medicare, the hospital institutional part. 
   I have cited on several occasions on the floor of the Senate anticoagulant drugs because I think they best illustrate how serious the problem is and why it needs a bipartisan solution along the lines of the Snowe-Wyden bill. It makes some sense. These anticoagulant drugs might cost in the vicinity of $1,000 a year to cover the needs of an older person. But if with anticoagulant medicine we can prevent this debilitating injury, that could save in the vicinity of $100,000. That would be expenses incurred when an older person suffers a stroke. 
   Think of that: $1,000 for an anticoagulant medicine, and as a result of a senior being able to afford that, very often that person can stay healthy and keep from being struck by debilitating stroke and incurring $100,000 in expenses that would come about as a result of that illness. 
   I hope seniors will continue to write to me and to other Members of the Senate, as this poster says. We hope they will send us copies of their prescription drug bills and actually send copies of how they are affected to each of us here in the Senate in Washington, DC. 
   I want to take just a minute or two now to read from some of the letters I have received in the last few days. 
   One of the first is a letter I received from an older couple in North Bend. The spouse is 73. Her husband is 77. They report that they have about $18,000 a year in Social Security income and spend about $2,000 of it on their prescription drugs. They have a Blue Cross plan. It doesn't cover any of their prescriptions--none of them. 
   I think this is really sort of typical of what I have been hearing from senior citizens across our State. 
   Here is a copy of what these bills look like for folks who are thinking about sending them to us. This one comes from North Bend, OR. It comes from the Safeway pharmacy there in North Bend. An older couple points out in a letter to me that they simply are not going to be able to afford what they are told is going to be the next increase. They are told that next month their bills are going to go up again on top of what I have cited they are having to pay for over-the-counter medications as well. Compared to some of their friends, they are not what they call ``pill takers.'' With an income of $18,000 a year, think of having to spend about $2,000 of it on prescription drugs, and that doesn't even count for what they spend on over-the-counter medications. Their bills are going up again next month. 
   These are the kinds of people to whom I think the Senate ought to be listening. 
   Another letter I received in the last few days comes from an older couple in Redmond. They sent me this bill for the month of October. Just for the month of October, colleagues who maybe listening in--$282 a month just for the month of October from an older couple in Redmond. They went to the Rite-Aid Pharmacy in a mall in Redmond. They are faced now with the prospect of having to spend $282 a month all year round on their prescriptions, and, suffice it to say, they too are asking why it is that the Congress, and the Senate specifically, isn't being responsive. Here is a third bill I received in the last few days. This is from an older woman who is spending close to $300 a month on her prescription drugs at the Wal-Mart in Roseburg. 
   This is again the kind of real-life case to which I think the Senate ought to be paying attention. They are just sending us now copies of their bills. These are not drugs that are uncommon. Glucophage, for example, for a lot of seniors is an essential medicine because it helps them with their diabetes. When senior citizens can't afford to pay for a prescription for glucophage, they are going to suffer some very serious health problems as a result. 
   I cited examples at the end of last week. 
   There are seniors at home in Oregon who have prescriptions their doctor wrote out for drugs such as that, and they simply could not afford to have them filled. They were hanging on to the prescription hoping that sometime down the road they would get the funds to be able to afford their prescriptions. 
   That is the kind of case we are hearing about from the Nation's older people. 
   I hope folks who are listening in tonight will see, as this poster says, that we hope to hear from more of them. We would like for them, as this poster says, to send copies of their prescription drug bills directly to us in the Senate in Washington, DC. 
   I intend to keep coming to the floor of this body and going through some of these cases in the hopes that this can pique the conscience of the Senate for bipartisan action. 
   Finally, tonight I have one other bill that struck me as so poignant and really summing it up. It comes from an older man who sends his wife's mother's bill because she is 91 and she is spending about $400 per month on prescription medicines. The letter says this is outrageous for a 91-year-old person, a person who is on a fixed income, to have to pay. She is 91 years old. The list goes on for pages. 
   I am going to wrap up tonight by saying it would be one thing if you couldn't bring Senators together around an important issue and simply not find any consensus whatsoever. 
   That is not the case with respect to the Snowe-Wyden legislation. The senior Senator from Maine and I have teamed up on a bill that is modeled after the kind of health care Members of the United States Senate receive. 
   Mr. President, 54 Members of the Senate, as part of the budget debate, said they would vote for a way to pay for the plan. We are seeing these polls and interviews along the lines of what I cited. Newspapers were filled this weekend with folks saying, why can't the Senate act? That is the question: Why can't the Senate act when there is a bipartisan bill? 
   The SPICE legislation, the Senior Prescription Insurance Coverage Equity Act, is legislation I believe can move forward because it is bipartisan. Certainly, our colleagues have other ideas about how to proceed. Senator SNOWE and I are anxious to hear from them with respect to their approach. 
   What is important is that the Senate stop ducking this issue. The Senate ought to say we are now going to recognize how serious these concerns of the Nation's older people are and not just put them off and say it is too complicated to deal with now and we will talk about it in 2001, but with a year to go until election, we ought to roll up our sleeves and come up with a bipartisan plan to address these needs. 
   Until that time, I hope seniors will continue to send copies of their prescription drug bills to each Senator. I  am particularly anxious to have them. Send them to our offices in Washington, DC. I will keep coming to the floor of this body, reading from letters from folks, including this 91-year-old who cannot afford next month's increase in prescription drugs, folks who cannot pay for their diabetes medicine and are likely to get much sicker as a result. I intend to keep coming to the floor of this body, reading from those letters, and doing everything I can to try to bring the Senate together around bipartisan legislation to meet the needs of our elderly. 
   The approach behind the Snowe-Wyden legislation does not involve price controls. We have a lot of Senators legitimately concerned about that. It is not a one-size-fits-all Federal regime. It is a model based on something we all know well. That is the Federal Employees Health Benefits Plan. In fact, the SPICE Program that Senator SNOWE and I have drafted is a senior citizens version of the Federal Employees Health Benefits Plan. We are convinced it can work for the Nation's older people. 
   I hope we will not pass up this opportunity to address these heartfelt concerns that seniors are passing on. I hope we will not say this issue is too complicated for the Senate to act. We may be leaving in a few days, but there will be an opportunity in the days ahead to bring Senators of both political parties together and fashion legislation that is responsive to the country's older people. I am convinced older people cannot afford to wait another year, wait another year for politicking and debates to go forward. Certainly, based on the kinds of bills, as the bill I read from, including the 91-year-old senior spending $400 a month, she cannot afford to wait, at 91, for another year of electioneering. I believe when there is a bipartisan bill before the Senate, she shouldn't have to wait. 
   I will continue to read from these letters. I hope folks will send copies of their prescription drug bills. We need to act on this matter. We saw again this weekend how important it is to the American people. I will be coming back to this floor again and again and again until we get bipartisan action on this urgent matter for millions of the Nation's older people. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I have been coming to the floor now on a number of occasions, as we move toward the end of our work for this year, in an effort to try to build bipartisan support for ensuring that senior citizens can get prescription drugs under their Medicare. 
   There is one bipartisan bill now before the Senate. It is the legislation that Senator SNOWE and I have introduced together. Fifty-four Members of the Senate have voted for this bill. It seems so sad that the Senate cannot come together on an issue such as this and provide some real relief for the Nation's older people. 
   So as part of this effort to get bipartisan support for legislation to cover seniors for their prescription drug bills, I have come to the floor and urged seniors to send in copies of their prescription drug bills, 
   to send in copies of their bills to all of us here in the Senate in Washington, DC. I hope that in doing that, it will help generate some awareness about how serious a problem this really is for the Nation's older people. 
   As I have done on previous occasions, I come to the floor to discuss some of these letters. This afternoon, I want to take a couple of minutes to talk about a handful of the letters I have received from senior citizens in my hometown of Portland. We have read from letters from seniors across the State of Oregon in the past. Today, I thought I would look to my hometown and describe a little bit about what the seniors are faced with in terms of trying to pay these prescription bills. 
   One elderly widow wrote me in the last couple of days from Portland to describe her situation as one where she has a monthly income of $806. She spends about $150 of that monthly income on her prescriptions. She indicates she is having problems paying for these very large prescription drug bills. When asked by our staff what she does in a situation such as this, she just said: I do without and pray. That was her response to the question of making sure she could get help with her prescriptions. She goes on to say, when we asked her about choosing between food and fuel and health care--we have literally millions of our Nation's seniors today walking on an economic tightrope, balancing these costs, medical bills against their fuel bills. When we asked her how she handled the situation with respect to her medicine, she said: I just wait. I always pay the utilities first. 
   Now, this isn't some kind of statistic or abstract kind of matter that the think tanks are debating here in the beltway. This is a senior citizen back home in Portland, my hometown. She has a monthly income of $806. She spends $150 of it on her prescription medicines. When she can't afford her prescriptions, she writes me: I just do without and pray. 
   How is it that a country as rich and strong and powerful as ours can't provide some relief to an elderly widow with an income of $806 a month, spending more than $150 of it on her prescriptions and literally having to pray she will get some help with her medical bills? How is it that our country, so strong and so good, can't come up with a plan to help an elderly widow such as this? 
   Senator SNOWE and I are part of a bipartisan team trying to address it. The Snowe-Wyden legislation has garnered 54 votes on the floor of the Senate in terms of its funding plan. Already a majority of the Senate is on record as saying this is an appropriate way to try to fund a prescription drug benefit for older people. I am concerned--this is right at the heart of the philosophy behind the Snowe-Wyden legislation--that if we don't act, and act in a bipartisan way, in this session of the Congress before we wrap up our business next year, it will be years before older people get some help with their prescription drugs. 
   I am very often asked at town hall meetings and other gatherings whether our Nation can afford to cover prescription drugs. My view is, we cannot afford not to cover these prescription drugs. Not only are we hearing about the suffering in these letters I keep bringing to the floor of the Senate, but we are seeing in so many instances that if older people could get just a little bit of help with their prescription drug costs, that would help our country save much more expensive medical bills down the road. 
   I have repeatedly cited on this floor the anticoagulant drugs. That seems to me a particularly good example. The evidence shows that if older people can get help with some of these anticoagulant medicines--the cost might be $1,000 a year for help with anticoagulant medicines--they could save the cost they might incur if they suffer a stroke as a result of not getting their medicines. Those costs can be upwards of $100,000 a year. That is, in effect, the kind of challenge with which we are faced. Either we address this issue on a bipartisan basis--that is what the Snowe-Wyden legislation is all about--or we continue to have our senior citizens suffering, whether it is in Alabama, Oregon, or any other State. This is an area where we can work in a bipartisan way. 
   In the Snowe-Wyden legislation, we reject price controls. This isn't a run from Washington, one-size-fits-all Federal approach. We try to use marketplace forces, the ingenuity of the marketplace to give senior citizens some clout. It is a model we all know something about. Federal employees in Alabama and Oregon use the Federal Employees Health Benefits Plan. It is marketplace oriented. It gives folks choices and options and alternatives. That is the model behind the Snowe-Wyden legislation. 
   Our bill is called SPICE, the Senior Prescription Insurance Coverage Equity Act. With a majority of the Senate already having voted for a funding plan for the program, we think that is the way to proceed. 
   As seniors hear us on the floor of the Senate talking about this issue and urging that folks send us copies of their prescription drug bills to the Senate in Washington, DC, they may have other ideas than the Snowe-Wyden legislation. The important thing is, there is no reason this Senate cannot come together in a bipartisan fashion and act in a way to provide real and meaningful relief to the Nation's older people. 
   I will cite another couple of examples of older people who have been writing us in recent days. An elderly gentleman from Portland, again, describes taking five drugs, a lot of them very familiar--Minocin, nitroglycerin for blood pressure, for heart ailments connected with diabetes. This gentleman has a monthly income of about $900. He is spending about $170 from his monthly income on prescriptions. 
   We talked to him about what it means for him to be in this kind of financial crunch where, out of a monthly income of $900, $170 of it goes for prescriptions. He reports that if he could have a little bit of help with his prescriptions, he would have money for other things he describes as clothing. 
   So we are not talking about seniors getting help with their prescriptions and then suddenly using it for some sort of luxury or something that might be considered nonessential. These seniors are talking about not having enough money to pay for essentials. When they can't get help for their prescription drugs, such as this elderly gentleman in Portland, this gentleman said, in effect, he can't afford his clothing. He cannot afford clothing. 
   Of course, that, to some extent, is a health-related kind of matter because older people are susceptible to illness. This is getting to be the colder part of the year. These are folks who, if they can't get adequate clothing, may pick up illnesses as a result of not being able to afford warm clothes. 
   What we are talking about may not be of great importance to some of these think tanks in Washington. I have seen they are putting out all kinds of reports that this is not all that important to seniors. I talk to senior citizens at home in Oregon. The seniors we are  talking to know these are real problems. What they want to see is the Senate deal with them in a bipartisan kind of fashion. They want to see us get beyond some of the bickering and the finger pointing. 
   The Snowe-Wyden legislation is built on that principle. We don't want to see the U.S. Senate duck this issue, have it go out on the campaign trail where Democrats will attack the Republicans and Republicans will attack back. That is really easy. It is easy to take issues like this, using the campaign fodder for advertisements. What is tough is crafting bipartisan legislation. 
   So I am very hopeful that seniors, as this poster says, will send in copies of their prescription drug bills to us here in the Senate in Washington, DC. Instead of having to come to the floor of the Senate day after day, as I have, I can come to the floor of the Senate and talk about being proud of working with my colleagues on a bipartisan basis to address this issue. 
   Before I wrap this up for this afternoon, I wanted to mention one other account that came to Tualatin just outside Portland at home in Oregon. This was an elderly couple, they spend about $300 a month on their prescription drugs. They are taking 11 prescriptions. They report that they are retired but are trying to work to pay for prescriptions. The husband is over 65 and he is trying to work now in order to pay their prescription drug bills of $300 a month. This is an elderly couple in Tualatin, OR. None of it is covered by health insurance. They report to us that they are cutting down on other essentials that are important to them, but they are going to keep working. The husband is going to keep working simply to pay the couple's prescription drug bills. 
   Think about that for a moment, the three cases I have read from today: An elderly widow who can't pay her prescription drug bills without great hardship with an income of $806 a month, with $150 for prescriptions. She says, ``I just do without and pray.'' Next is an elderly gentlemen from Portland, with a monthly income of $900 a month, and he is spending about $170 of it on prescription drugs. He says he hopes to be able to get some coverage so he would be able to afford some clothing --an essential, especially as we move into the cold weather season. And then, finally, is the couple I just mentioned with $300 a month in prescription drug bills, with the husband not in good health but continuing to work solely to pay for their prescriptions. 
   I think it is so sad that when we have had a majority in the Senate go on record as voting for a plan to fund this important benefit for the elderly, when I know there are Senators of good will on both sides of the aisle who would like to work on a marketplace solution to covering prescription drugs for seniors, the Senate can't come together and deal with it. The fact is, our senior citizens are getting creamed with respect to their prescription drug bills, and it happens two ways. First, Medicare never covered prescriptions when the program began in 1965. I guess the architects didn't think it would be all that important. 
   As I have said on the floor of the Senate, it is more important today than it used to be because many of these drugs help to lower bills because they are preventive in nature. In addition to Medicare not covering prescriptions, what is happening today is if you are a senior citizen in Alabama, or in Oregon, and you walk into a drugstore in a small town in Oregon or in the State of the Presiding Officer, that senior citizen who walks into the drugstore, in effect, subsidizes the big buyers of medicine. If you are a health maintenance organization in Oregon, or in any other State, you can go out 
   and negotiate a discount. You can go out and negotiate a good price on your medicine. You have clout in the marketplace. But if you are a senior citizen who just walks into a drugstore, you don't have any bargaining power, you don't have any clout. So, in effect, that senior citizen who walks into a pharmacy is subsidizing the big buyers in the community, the health maintenance organizations that can negotiate a discount. Those seniors are getting creamed twice. Medicare doesn't cover it, and then they have to subsidize the big buyers. 
   So I intend to keep coming to the floor of the Senate, continuing to bring to light these various kinds of real-life examples from home in Oregon. I hope seniors, as this poster indicates, will send us copies of their prescription drug bills. I want to hear from them. I want folks who are listening to the work of the Senate and are following this to send me and my colleagues copies of your prescription drug bills. Send it to us, each of us here, as the poster says, in Washington, DC. 
   I want you to do it for just one reason: I think this is the kind of problem that we are sent here to deal with. This is not some trifling, inconsequential matter. This is a question of whether we are going to respond to the more than 20 percent of the Nation's senior citizens who are walking on an economic tightrope every year, spending more than $1,000 a year out-of-pocket on prescriptions, balancing food costs against fuel costs, and fuel costs against their medical costs. As I have said again and again, they are giving up medicines that are essential to their health. 
   I mentioned yesterday older people with diabetes who can't afford the Glucophage, an essential diabetes drug. This is not something that is inconsequential; this is something that, for older people, can literally mean the difference between decent health or incurring a very, very serious illness and, often, even death. 
   Let us not be indifferent to the plight of those older people. They are asking the Senate for action. The bipartisan Snowe-Wyden legislation is one approach that I happen to favor. But I am sure our colleagues have other ideas. What is unacceptable to me, though, is to just say that this Senate won't take it up, we will save it for the campaign trail of 2000, we will tackle it another day. We ought to tackle it now. This has been an issue and a concern of the Nation's older people since back in the days when I was director of the Gray Panthers at home in Oregon. But it is getting to be an even bigger concern because more and more older people can't afford their medicine, and with more seniors interested in wellness and trying to stay healthy, this is the time for the United States Senate to act. 
   So I intend to keep coming back again and again to the floor of the Senate, and I hope seniors will send in copies of their prescription drug bills. I am proud there is a bipartisan bill now before the Senate to deal with this issue, the Snowe-Wyden legislation. I hope that seniors will be in contact with us, give us their ideas on whether they think our bill is the way to go, or if they prefer another route. What is unacceptable to me is for the Senate to duck this issue. We have an opportunity to work in a bipartisan fashion on it. I intend to keep coming back to the floor of the Senate again and again until we get that action. 
   With that, I yield the floor.

   Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I have always been supportive of modernizing the outdated laws and regulations governing the financial services industry. It doesn't make sense to me to slap a regulatory straight-jacket on American financial companies and drive up costs for consumers while companies around the globe are able to compete unhindered by unnecessary barriers. It seems to me that you can't compete in a 21st century global financial market using a playbook that was written during the Great Depression. 
   But I have also believed that financial services modernization shouldn't come at the expense of consumer and community interests. In fact, back in May, I voted against the Senate version of this bill, as did 43 of my colleagues here in the Senate, because it would have devastated lending in rural and low income communities, and because it didn't adequately address the issue of consumer financial privacy. 
   Fortunately, this conference report is leaps and bounds better than the bill that passed along party lines here in the Senate several months ago. It won't allow financial institutions to participate in the new and improved financial market unless they maintain a good community lending record. And, while far from perfect, it also begins to address the issue of consumer financial privacy, which was virtually non-existent in the previous bill. 
   This bill requires financial institutions to disclose their privacy and information sharing policies to their customers. And in some instances--but not enough--it allows consumers to block these companies from sharing their private customer information with other companies. This is an improvement over the original Senate bill, and even an improvement over current law. 
   This is a good start on financial privacy, but it doesn't close the deal. The privacy provisions in the conference report do not provide the level of protection that the American people deserve. 
   There is a long way to go with respect to protecting the financial privacy of all Americans. While I am disappointed that the privacy protections in the bill are not as strong as I would like, I share the beliefs of several of my distinguished colleagues, such as Senator SARBANES and Senator LEAHY, that these protections can be and must be further strengthened by legislation next year, and I intend to work closely with my colleagues to make sure this happens. 
   On balance, the conference report should be adopted, and I hope that the same forces that worked so hard to move legislative mountains and align political stars to make this legislation possible will work equally as hard with me and other Senators next year to give Americans the privacy protection they demand and deserve.

   Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I have been coming to the floor over the last few days in an effort to win support for bipartisan legislation to secure prescription drug coverage for the Nation's older people. As part of that effort, I have been urging seniors, as this poster says, to send in copies of their prescription drug bills to each of us in the Senate in Washington, DC. 
   In addition to getting copies from seniors of their prescription drug bills, I am now hearing from seniors who are sending me copies of prescriptions they cannot afford to get filled. This is a prescription that was written for an older gentleman at home in Beaverton, OR. He is using 21 prescriptions at this point. He has already spent almost $1,700 this year on his prescriptions. Here we have three he cannot afford to get filled: Glucophage is a drug that one takes to deal with diabetes; Tagamet; Prilosec--three very common prescriptions older people in our country need and use. This is an example of what he sent me, prescriptions his doctor wrote out, and he can no longer afford to actually get them filled. 
   This is the kind of account I am hearing from seniors across the country. We have asked them to send in copies of their prescription drug bills. I have a whole sheaf of those, all kinds of bills we are receiving in that area. But now we are actually hearing from seniors and getting copies of their prescriptions their physicians are writing for them that they cannot even take to a drugstore and get filled. 
   In the last 24 hours, we in the Senate have been watching the news reports about the dueling press conferences involving prescriptions. There has been an awful lot of finger pointing one way or another. Frankly, each one of them has some reasonable points to make. What is so frustrating is that instead of these dueling press conferences and going back and forth, having all this finger pointing, the Senate ought to be working on bipartisan legislation. 
   There is one bipartisan bill now before the Senate. It is the Snowe-Wyden legislation. The Senator from Maine and I have teamed up over the last few months to put together a bipartisan bill to get prescription drugs covered for older people on Medicare. We have 54 Members of the Senate already on record as voting for a specific plan to fund this program. A majority of the Senate is now on record for a bipartisan proposal to pay for prescriptions. 
   Here we are, with the session only having a few more days to go, Senators--I am sure I am not the only one--getting copies from seniors of prescriptions that they cannot actually afford to have filled. We have asked them in recent days to send us copies of their prescription drug bills. They have been doing that. Now they are sending us copies of prescriptions they cannot afford to take to their neighborhood pharmacy and get covered. 
   It is so sad to see these dueling press conferences, and then we don't have a response, to have seniors telling us the sad and often tragic stories about how  they can't afford to take their medicine. Their doctor tells them to take three pills. They don't do that. They start taking two. They start taking one. Eventually they get much sicker. 
   The Snowe-Wyden legislation is bipartisan. It uses marketplace forces. We don't have a Federal price control regime. We don't have a one-size-fits-all health care policy. 
   We have the kind of approach that works for Members of Congress and their families. 
   Our bill, called SPICE, the Senior Prescription Insurance Coverage Equity Act, is a senior citizens version of the kind of health plan that Members of Congress have. We incorporated recommendations from consumer groups. Families USA, for example, has made some excellent recommendations on consumer protections that older people need. 
   We have also listened to the insurance sector and the pharmaceutical sector, making sure there would be adequate incentives for research and the initiatives that are underway to help us find a cure for Alzheimer's and all of the illnesses that are so tragic, for which every Member of the Senate wants to see a cure. 
   I will keep coming to the floor. I want to cite a couple more examples before we wrap up. I know other colleagues want to speak. 
   I heard recently from a senior citizen in Forest Grove that in recent months she spent almost $1,500 on her prescription drugs. Another older person from the Portland metropolitan area reported that in a few months, she spent over $600 for her medications. She is now taking more than seven medications on an ongoing basis. 
   Very often the families have to go out and try to find free samples to compensate for some of the drugs the older people can't afford. Families have to chip in when it is hard for them to afford medicine. They are all asking, is the Senate going to just bicker about this issue or is the Senate going to come together in a bipartisan way and actually do something about these problems? We have more than 20 percent of the Nation's older people spending over $1,000 a year out of pocket on their medicine. 
   I am very often asked: Can this Nation afford to cover prescription drugs? My response is, we cannot afford not to cover these prescriptions. As I have cited several times during these presentations, a lot of these drugs help us to hold down costs. They help us to deal with blood pressure and cholesterol. The anticoagulant drugs are absolutely key to preventing strokes. I cited an example of one important anticoagulant drug where for $1,000 a year, in terms of the cost to the senior, they are able to save $100,000 in expenses that they would incur if they suffered a debilitating stroke when they couldn't get these medicines. 
   It is absolutely essential that we secure this coverage for the Nation's older people. It seems to me now a question of political will. Can we set aside some of the partisanship on this health care issue, some of the bickering that has gone on back and forth? I believe the Snowe-Wyden legislation--a majority of the Senate has already voted for in terms of its funding plan--is the way to go. But I know colleagues have other ideas. 
   What we ought to do is resolve to deal with this issue in a bipartisan way. I hope seniors will continue to send us copies of their prescription drug bills, as the poster says, to their Senator in Washington, DC. 
   I hope in the days ahead we won't see a whole lot more of these tragedies such as the one I have cited today. It is one thing for a senior to send in their bills and say, I am having difficulty paying for this; I hope you will cover it. But it is quite another for a senior citizen to send me, as this older person did from Beaverton, a copy of his prescriptions saying--it says it right down in the margin--``can't afford to get filled.'' Prescriptions his doctor ordered, in effect the prescriptions go unfilled. These are important medicines. If you don't take Glucophage and you have diabetes, you can have some very serious health problems. 
   I am hopeful the Senate will look to get beyond the dueling press conferences, look beyond some of the issues that have surrounded this discussion in a partisan way and say: We are going to come together and go to bat for seniors and their families. It is time to do it. 
   I intend to keep coming back to the floor until we secure this coverage. It was important for seniors back in the days when I was director of the Gray Panthers. It is even more important now because these drugs can help us to save bigger health care bills down the road. I will be back on the floor continually calling for a bipartisan approach to this issue, one that uses marketplace forces to deal with the challenge of health care costs. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, the issue of prescription drugs for the Nation's senior citizens is back in the headlines this morning with yet another study having been published that millions of senior citizens in America cannot afford their prescriptions. 
   This is the 12th time I have come to the floor in recent days to talk about this issue because I think it is so critical that the Senate act in a bipartisan way to deal with what are clearly the great out-of-pocket costs for the Nation's older people. Specifically, as this poster next to me says, I have been urging senior citizens to send in copies of their prescription drug bills to each of us in the Senate in Washington, DC. 
   The reason I hope we will hear from seniors around the country is there is one bipartisan bill, one that is before the Senate now, to deal with this question of prescription needs for seniors. It is the bill on which Senator OLYMPIA SNOWE and I have teamed up in recent months, and 54 Members of this body, the majority, have already voted for the funding plan that is laid out in the Snowe-Wyden legislation. So we have 54 Members of the Senate on record as supporting a specific plan to cover prescription drugs for the Nation's older people. 
   The model in the Snowe-Wyden legislation is something that every Member of the Senate is familiar with because it is the model we have for health care for ourselves and our families. The  Snowe-Wyden legislation is called SPICE, the Senior Prescription Insurance Coverage Equity Act. It would ensure that seniors would get their medicine at an affordable rate because our bill would allow them the bargaining power that big organizations, big purchasers such as the health maintenance organizations would have. 
   The tragedy today with respect to our Nation's seniors and prescriptions is they get shellacked twice; first, because Medicare does not cover prescriptions. When the program began in 1965, it did not cover prescriptions initially. Second, because the big buyers, the health maintenance organizations and the other big purchasers, are able to use their clout in the marketplace, those folks can get a discount and a senior citizen in rural Oregon or rural New Mexico or another part of this country in effect has to subsidize with their dollars the break 
   the large organizations are getting. 
   Frankly, there are other ideas for dealing with this issue. Colleagues on both sides of the aisle have them. What I am trying to do to support the Snowe-Wyden bipartisan legislation is to come to the floor and, as this poster says, ask our seniors to send copies of their prescription drug bills directly to us in the Senate in Washington. I am going to, as I have done on 11 previous occasions recently, actually read from some of these bills so we can make the case for how urgent this need is. 
   For example, I recently received a letter from a woman in Portland who described to me what she and her husband are facing with respect to their prescription drug costs. This couple in Portland has a combined income of about $1,500 a month. She spends, from that $1,500-a-month income, $230 on prescription drugs and he spends about $180 a month. So the two of them, an elderly couple in Portland, are spending more than $400 a month on prescription drugs. They are spending upwards of $4,000 a year on their prescription medicine and, as they reported to me, they have no insurance to cover these costs. 
   This morning in Washington we saw, again, more press conferences on this issue. I guess we can go day after day having dueling press conferences with respect to this issue of prescription drugs. We can have a lot of finger pointing, we can have a lot of bickering, a lot of quarreling about how serious the problem is and what to do about it, but there is one bipartisan bill that uses marketplace forces to try to deal with this issue. The Snowe-Wyden legislation steers clear of price controls. We do not have a Federal regime for handling this benefit. It is not one-size-fits-all Federal policy. It uses marketplace forces to make sure seniors have choices and options and alternatives for their prescription medicines. It is based on a model that all of us are pretty familiar with because we utilize the Federal Employees Health Benefits Plan. 
   I want to go through a couple more of these cases. I know the distinguished Senator from Louisiana is here to speak on an important matter, as are other colleagues. But I do, as part of this effort, want to highlight with these specific cases some of what we are seeing all across this country as seniors walk this economic tightrope, balancing their food costs against their fuel costs, and their fuel costs against their medical bills and find themselves, again and again, not in a position to pay for their prescriptions. 
   I received another letter in the last few days from a senior citizen in Oregon. She is on seven prescriptions. She has heart disease; she has high blood pressure and diabetes. She and her husband exist on Social Security and a tiny disability check. They get a couple of thousand dollars a month maximum in their income. Every month, they spend at least $300 of it on prescription drugs. That is just the wife in the household. Her husband has to spend additionally on prescription drugs. This particular elderly person wrote and said if it were not for the free samples that she was getting from her physician, she simply could not meet her expenses. 
   Another letter I received described a senior taking five prescription drugs. She has high blood pressure and high thyroid. She has an income of a little under $1,000 a month. She spends about $100 a month on prescription drugs. And she wrote me:  
   I am lucky that my kids will give me a hand when I have difficulty in affording my prescriptions.  
   As part of this effort to have the Senate deal with this urgent need for older people in a bipartisan way, I would like to see the Senate consider the one bipartisan bill before us now, the Snowe-Wyden legislation. But I am sure colleagues have other ideas, and I think if we will listen to the senior citizens of this country who are sending me and our colleagues copies of these bills--as the poster says, ``Send in copies of prescription drug bills directly to us here in the Senate''--we can help the Senate deal with this issue on a bipartisan basis. 
   I am going to wrap up this afternoon with a question I hope a lot of colleagues are asking with respect to prescription drug coverage: Can our Nation afford to cover prescription drug costs of older people? My answer to that is: I believe we cannot afford not to ensure that our seniors get this coverage. I want to cite an example before I wrap up. 
   Last week, I talked about the evidence we are seeing with the new anticoagulant drugs. These are important drugs that can help seniors prevent strokes and debilitating illnesses. As a result of seniors taking these medicines, which cost about $1,000 a year, there is documented medical evidence now that these drugs can help prevent strokes, which cost upwards of $100,000 a year. So think about the investment, the wise investment--not just from a health standpoint, not just from the standpoint of trying to make sure our seniors get a fair shake but purely from a financial standpoint--the benefit of having seniors get prescription drug coverage, getting, for example, these anticoagulant drugs that cost about $1,000 a year, and seeing a savings as a result of the older person not having a stroke, of that person not incurring $100,000 in expenses that would be involved in treating the stroke. 
   I was director of the Gray Panthers at home for about 7 years before I was elected to the Congress. Prescription drugs were important then. You would always hear from seniors that they want this coverage. But the prescriptions today are even more important because they can help keep seniors well. Prescriptions today, helping to lower blood pressure, helping lower cholesterol, are drugs that are going to help us hold costs down for the Medicare program. 
   As we all know, Medicare Part A, the hospital portion, the institutional portion of the program is particularly expensive, and these drugs today, if we can get decent Medicare coverage for the Nation's older people, will help us save some of the money that would otherwise be spent under Part A of the program when seniors incur these debilitating illnesses. 
   I intend, as I have done now on 12 occasions, to keep coming to the floor to urge seniors to send in copies of their prescription drug bills directly to us in the Senate in hopes we can get bipartisan action. I am very proud that the Snowe-Wyden funding plan got 54 votes, a majority of votes in the Senate already for going forward with a specific plan to fund this program, but I am sure colleagues have other ideas. 
   The distinguished chairman of the Finance Committee is here. He has been very involved in the question of Medicare. I was very honored when Senator MOYNIHAN, last week, spoke favorably about the SPICE legislation we have introduced. Colleagues have plenty of ideas on how to deal with it, but what is important is we go forward in a bipartisan way and not wait until after another election which is literally a year away. 
   In the hope the Senate will act in a bipartisan way, I intend to keep coming back to the floor to discuss this issue. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I am on the floor tonight for what is really the 10th time in recent days to talk about the need for decent prescription drug coverage for the Nation's elderly citizens. There is one bipartisan bill now before the Senate. It is the Snowe-Wyden bill. I believe so strongly in this issue because of what I am hearing from senior citizens in my home State and now, frankly, from across the United States. 
   What I have decided to do, as part of the effort to advance the prospect of dealing with this issue and dealing with it on a bipartisan basis, is to come to the floor as frequently as I can in the hectic Senate schedule to read from some of these bills I am getting from the Nation's senior citizens. 
   As you can see in the poster next to us, on behalf of the Snowe-Wyden legislation, I am urging seniors to send in copies of their prescription drug bills directly to us at the United States Senate, Washington, DC 20510, because I would like to see the Senate deal with this issue and not just put it off because some are saying it is too difficult and too hard to deal with in this contentious climate. I believe Members of the Senate are sent here to deal with tough issues. This is one that would meet an enormous need. 
   For a number of years before I was elected to the Congress, I served as director of the Oregon Gray Panthers. The need for coverage of prescription drugs was extremely important back then. It was always a big priority for senior citizens. 
   Frankly, it is much more important today because so many of the drugs that are available now are preventive in nature. They help keep seniors well. They help us to hold down the cost of medical care in America. A lot of these drugs today, the blood pressure medicine, the cholesterol medicine, keep seniors well and keep us from needing much greater sums of money to pick up the cost of tragic illnesses. 
   Last week, I cited as one example an important anticoagulant drug. This is a drug that can be available to the Nation's seniors for somewhere in the vicinity of $1,000 a year. But if a senior gets sick, if a senior suffers a debilitating stroke, the expenses associated  with that treatment can be more than $100,000. Just think about that--a modest investment in decent prescription drug coverage for the Nation's elderly people, an anticoagulant drug that costs $1,000 a year can help save $100,000 in much more significant medical expenses. 
   As the President knows, we have a real challenge in terms 
   of ensuring the stability of the Medicare program. The Part A program, the institutional program, is the one that is going to escalate in cost if we can't do more to make prescription drug coverage a significant part of outpatient benefits for the Nation's seniors. 
   I am very hopeful this Senate will act on this issue. I believe this is the kind of issue that could be a legacy for this session of Congress. 
   All over the Nation, seniors are telling us now they cannot afford their prescription medicine. I am going to read from three more letters I have recently received from folks at home. The first is from an elderly woman in Toledo, OR. She writes:  
   Dear Senator Wyden, I am an 81-year-old widow. My only income, Social Security, allows me to pay for glaucoma, angina, high blood pressure, all of which I have problems. I am taking eight prescription medications daily. My Medicare supplement insurance doesn't cover medication.  
   For just 1 month for those medicines, she has to spend $166. On top of that, she reports that every other month she has to spend a little over $62 for a small bottle of eye drops. As she says:  
   That adds up to a lot. If I don't use the eye drops, I go blind. And if I don't use the other medications, I will have a stroke, a heart attack or both. Myself, and I am sure many others, are in exactly the same boat.  
   She, as part of her letter, encloses a copy of her bills. 
   Now, this isn't the kind of thing we might hear from some Washington, DC, think tank that is putting out reports about whether or not this is a serious problem and whether or not seniors really need this prescription drug coverage. This is a real live case. This isn't an abstract kind of matter. This is an 81-year-old widow in the State of Oregon who is taking eight prescriptions a day, spending from a modest fixed income $166 a month for those eight prescriptions. 
   Every other month, on top of that, she has to pay for her eye drops. It is very clear that if she doesn't get those medicines, she is going to have the much more serious problems--heart attacks and strokes--that are so debilitating to older people. 
   Another letter that I got in the last couple of days comes from Medford, OR, from seniors there who discussed the question of prescription drug coverage there at the senior citizens center. They said:  
   We are glad you are launching a movement to gain support for prescription drug coverage for seniors. They hope it goes through. Enclosed you will find a computer printout of the amounts I spend on prescriptions and drugs. More than 10 percent of our annual budget is used to defray prescription costs. That does not include the miscellaneous items related to drug purchases.  
   She sent me this, and I will hold up a copy of it. It is an example of the kind of information we are getting. She actually sent us an enumerated copy of the prescription bills that she is paying at home in Medford, OR. These are not isolated cases. I have been on the floor now, this is the tenth occasion, taking three or four of these cases every single time. I hope seniors and families who are listening tonight will look at this poster and see we are urging that they send in copies of their prescription drug bills to their Senators here in the U.S. Senate in Washington, DC, because I am hopeful that this can prick the conscience of the Senate and bring about constructive action before this session is over. 
   The Snowe-Wyden legislation is bipartisan. Fifty-four Members of this body have already voted for this bill. We have a majority in the Senate on record on behalf of the funding mechanism that we envisage in our legislation. We use marketplace forces. I am not talking about a price control regime or about a one-size-fits-all approach to Federal health care; it is one that is very familiar to the Presiding Officer and to all our colleagues. It is really a model based on the Federal Employees Health Benefits Plan. The Snowe-Wyden legislation is called SPICE. It stands for the Senior Prescription Insurance Coverage Equity Act. It is bipartisan. We do think it would help create choices, options, and alternatives for the Nation's older people. 
   I am very hopeful this Senate will say we cannot afford to duck this issue. I am often asked whether we can afford to cover prescription medicine for the Nation's older people. I am of the view that we cannot afford not to cover prescriptions, because what we are going to save as a result of these medicines of the future, and the breakthroughs that we are achieving in terms of preventive care and wellness, is going to far exceed the costs that might be incurred as a result of debilitating illnesses that seniors will suffer if they can't get the medicine. As part of this effort to get bipartisan support for the Snowe-Wyden legislation, I intend to keep coming to the floor of the Senate and reading from these letters. 
   Before I wrap up tonight, I wish to bring up one other case that I thought was particularly poignant. This also was a letter from an elderly person in Medford. Her Social Security monthly income was $582. Over the last few months, she spent over $700 on her prescription medicine, and every 3 months, in addition, she has to pay for her health insurance plan, which doesn't seem to cover many of the health care needs that she has. 
   Just think about that. With a monthly Social Security income of $582, over recent months she spent more than $700 on prescription drugs. Her private policy doesn't cover many of her health care needs. She also is sending me copies of her bills in an effort to get the Senate to see how important this issue is. 
   Members of the Senate, I know, care about older people; a number of them have come up to me while I have been on the floor these last couple of weeks talking about this issue and said: You are right; we need to act on it. It is hard to see what is actually holding up the effort to go forward in the Senate. 
   This is the last period before the year is out. Certainly we can come together as a body and get ready to address this issue early next year. We have a majority in the Senate on record and voting for a specific plan to fund this benefit. It is based on a model that uses marketplace forces that ought to be appealing to both sides of the aisle. It is a model with which Members of Congress are familiar because of the Federal Employees Health Benefits Plan. It is the basis of the Snowe-Wyden legislation. It is hard to see what is really holding up the effort to win passage of this important legislation. 
   I guess part of the problem is that some of the political prognosticators say it is a difficult issue, that both sides are just going to fight it out on the campaign trail, and we can just wait until 2001 to actually take action on it. 
   When I hear from seniors at home, such as the letter I raised first from the elderly widow in Toledo who has eight prescriptions and pays more than $165 a month for her prescriptions, and folks in Medford who are on a small monthly income and spending a significant portion of it on prescription drugs, I don't think those people can afford to wait until after the 2001 election. Frankly, I think they expect us to deal with the concerns they have, and to deal with them now. 
   It is essentially one full year before there is another election. There is plenty of time to go out and campaign and have the vigorous discussion of the issues in the fall of 2000. But what we ought to do now is to act in a bipartisan way. The Snowe-Wyden legislation is that kind of effort. Senator SNOWE and I have said we are going to set aside some of the partisan bickering that has surrounded health care in this session of the Senate in years past; we are going to move forward and try to make sure seniors get some help. 
   I hope families and seniors who are listening tonight will look at this poster. We are urging that seniors send copies of their prescription drug bills directly to each of us in the Senate here in Washington, DC, and help us in the Senate to come together and deal with the issue that is of such extraordinary importance to our families. 
   There are a variety of ways this issue could be addressed. I think personally the Snowe-Wyden legislation, because it is bipartisan and because more than half of the Senate has voted for a plan to fund it, is the way to go. But I am sure there are other kinds of ideas.  
   When seniors send in copies of their prescription drug bills as we try to get action on this issue, I hope they will also let us know their ideas about legislative approaches, be it support for Senator SNOWE, the Snowe-Wyden legislation, or other kinds of approaches. 
   But what to me is unacceptable is just ducking. I do not think there is any excuse for inertia on this issue. I think it is time for the Senate to say we cannot afford, as a nation, to see seniors suffer the way they do when they cannot get prescription drug coverage. 
   Just as important as the questions of fairness for seniors, it seems to me, are the questions of economics. From an economic standpoint, the need to cover some of these prescription drugs for seniors looks to me like a pretty easy call. With a modest investment, we can save a whole lot of expense that comes about when they suffer strokes and heart attacks and the like when they cannot get their medicine. 
   So I hope in the days ahead, Members of the Senate, in senior centers and medical facilities and other places where we all go to visit, will take the time to talk to some of the folks at home about the need for prescription drug coverage and discuss ways we can actually get this benefit added in this session of the Senate. Too many of our seniors now cannot afford their medicine. That is what these bills are all about. What these bills and these letters I am getting from seniors at home in Oregon are all about is that they cannot afford their medicine. These are the people who are told by their doctors to take three prescriptions; they cannot afford to do that and they end up taking two prescriptions. Then they cannot afford to do that; then it is one. Pretty soon, sure as the night follows day, they get sicker and they need institutional care. That is, obviously, bad for their health and it is also bad for the Nation's fiscal health. So I intend to keep coming back to the floor of the Senate. 
   Since my days with the Gray Panthers at home in Oregon, I felt this was an important benefit for the Nation's older people. All these letters I am receiving as a result of folks sending in copies of their prescription drug bills, if anything, just reaffirms to me how important it is that the Senate act on this issue, and do it in a bipartisan way. 
   Let's show seniors, let's show the skeptics we can come together around this important priority. This is not a trifling matter. This is, for many, many seniors, their big out-of-pocket expense. Many of them do not have private health insurance that covers it. Many of them are simply falling between the cracks in terms of meeting their health care expenses. For many elderly people, as a result of escalating health costs, they are paying more proportionally out of their own pocket today than they were back when Medicare began in 1965. That should not be acceptable to any Member of the Senate. 
   I intend to come back to the floor again and again and again until this Senate, on a bipartisan basis, looks to addressing this prescription drug coverage. The Snowe-Wyden legislation is bipartisan. It uses marketplace forces. We reject the kind of price control regimes others may wish to pursue. I am hopeful we can get action on this issue because, for the millions of seniors who cannot afford their prescriptions, the Senate's willingness to tackle this issue, and do it on a bipartisan basis and get some relief for the seniors, will help instill a sense of confidence, a sense that the Senate is listening to them, hearing them, and is willing to respond to their most significant needs. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, this is the ninth time I have come to the floor of the Senate to talk about the issue of Medicare coverage for prescription drugs. As the Senate can see, I am urging seniors to send in copies of their prescription drug bills, as this poster instructs, to your Senator, U.S. Senate, Washington, D.C. 20510. 
   I am doing this because it is critically important that Congress move on this issue and address it in a bipartisan way. With the counsel and input of Senator SNOWE of Maine, there is one bipartisan bill now before the Senate to cover the issue of prescription drugs for the Nation's elderly. 
   I am sure other Members of the Senate are getting the kind of mail I am. What I will do this morning, as I have done on eight previous occasions, is talk specifically about some of the bills I am getting from senior citizens in Oregon in an effort to pull together a bipartisan coalition for action in this session. 
   We have heard, again and again, experts on the health care issue say the prescription drug question is too complicated for the Senate to act on at this time. That is a view I do not share. It is not shared by Senator SNOWE. In fact, 54 Members of the Senate have already voted for the funding plan the two of us have developed. We have already laid the foundation for the Senate to move on this issue in a bipartisan way. 
   I will talk for a few minutes this afternoon about our legislation and about some copies of bills I have received from senior citizens. I have a whole sheaf of them to go through. 
   What our bill is all about is trying to give senior citizens who are on Medicare the same kind of bargaining power in the marketplace that a health maintenance organization has. The sad part about this issue is that the senior citizens get shellacked on their prescription bills twice. Medicare doesn't cover prescription drugs. When the program began in 1965, it didn't cover prescriptions. Maybe back then there was a  feeling they weren't that important. If anybody thought that then, they certainly would not believe that now, because we have more than 20 percent of the Nation's senior citizens spending over $1,000 a year out of pocket for their prescription medicine. They can't afford these prescriptions. The doctors tell them to take three prescriptions. They start off taking two, and then they take one, and eventually they can't afford their medicine, and they get sicker and they need perhaps institutional care, which is far more expensive. What is so sad is that the seniors, of course, with Medicare not covering prescriptions, have to pay out of pocket. On top of that, they have to subsidize the big buyers, the health maintenance organizations, the health plans, and other big buyers that are in a position to get a discount on their prescription medicine. 
   So Senator SNOWE and I, in support of the bipartisan Snowe-Wyden bill, are urging seniors to send copies of their prescription drug bills to the Senate, to your Senators, in Washington, DC, in the hopes that we can deal with this in this session of the Senate. 
   I have been concerned about this issue since back in the days when I was codirector of the Oregon Gray Panthers. I ran the legal aid office for senior citizens then, and prescriptions were awfully important even then. But the fact is they are much more important to the Nation's older people today than they were then because, today, so many of these prescriptions can, in effect, help to keep seniors well and healthy and physically fit. So many of the drugs today can help to lower blood pressure, or deal with cholesterol problems, or a wide variety of conditions, and can keep our seniors healthy. The savings associated with these kinds of drugs are absolutely staggering. 
   I reported last week, when we talked about the question of prescriptions for seniors on the floor of the Senate, about one anticoagulant drug seniors often take today. It costs a little over $1,000 a year for a senior citizen to take that anticoagulant drug. By taking that drug, very often it is possible to prevent a debilitating stroke that can cost a senior more than $100,000, in terms of expenses. Just think of that. An anticoagulant drug helps our seniors stay healthy for about $1,000 a year. As a result of spending $1,000 a year on this particular medicine, we can keep that person from having a debilitating stroke, which could cost more than $100,000 a year. 
   So, very often, I am asked by colleagues and others in the Congress whether our Nation can afford to cover prescription drugs for the elderly. My answer is that our Nation cannot afford not to cover prescription drugs, when you look at the kind of savings that would be associated with this coverage. 
   Now, in the Snowe-Wyden bill, we seek to do a number of things beyond giving senior citizens the same kind of bargaining power that a health maintenance organization does. We focus on the principles of the private marketplace, trying to create choices and options and a wide variety of alternatives for the Nation's seniors, and we do it through a concept the President of the Senate and all of us understand very well, and that is, we use the model of the Federal Employees Health Benefits Plan. We don't go out and set up a whole new bureaucracy. We don't set up a lot of price controls and get the Government intervening in the marketplace. 
   I have great reservations about that kind of approach because, if you go with price controls, say, on Medicare, the only thing that will happen is you will shift all the costs onto the backs of 
   other vulnerable people. I don't think there is a Member of the Senate who would like to see us take action with respect to prescription drugs for the Nation's senior citizens, and then have a lot of costs shifted onto, say, a 27-year-old woman who is divorced and has two kids and is working hard and playing by the rules and suddenly is seeing the prescription drug costs for her children go up very dramatically. So we ought to unleash the forces of the marketplace. That is what is in the bipartisan Snowe-Wyden prescription drug bill. 
   What I am going to do for a few moments is talk about some of the bills and documents that I have been sent by seniors since we came to the floor and began to urge them, as this poster says, to send in copies of their prescription drug bills to us in the Senate. 
   The first case I want to talk about this morning involves a senior citizen who is 73 years old and lives in my home State, in Hillsboro. She has a monthly income of $1,000, and she is spending 25 percent of it on her prescription drugs. She doesn't have any of these bills covered by her health insurance--not any of them. She has to take a wide variety of drugs, such as Relafen and Prilosec--a whole host of prescription drugs--primarily due to hypertension and a variety of problems. Her Prilosec alone is one she has to take on a regular basis; yet, as a result of the expenses associated with her prescription medicine, this senior citizen at home in Hillsboro, OR, is not able to take all of the medication she needs. She reports that when she does take her Prilosec as her doctor tells her, she has had to give up other kinds of necessities. She is eating cheaper foods and is particularly concerned that if something isn't done about prescription drugs in the Senate, she is going to have a whole host of other problems. She is not able to afford other essentials, such as being able to take care of expenses for her house. 
   This is a real case, not some government report from some think tank in Washington, DC, hypothesizing about what the senior citizens need. This is a real, live case from my home State, in Hillsboro, OR. She heard I am urging senior citizens, as this poster says, to send in copies of their prescription drug bills to their Senators. 
   She sent me her case. Very clearly, these are heartrending cases--to think people with a $1,000-a-month income trying to get by on that alone is hard enough. Having to spend 25 percent of her income on prescription drugs, having to be part of a drug regime where she can't even take all that her doctor is telling her to take--this is what is going on in the United States of America. A country as rich and powerful and as good as ours has not yet figured out a way to help people such as this. It is a tragedy that we cannot come together on a bipartisan basis, the way the Snowe-Wyden bill envisages. There are other approaches that certainly would be appealing as well. But we need to get this done. What everybody says is that this Congress is so polarized, they can't deal with big issues. 
   Well, I believe the bipartisan Snowe-Wyden bill, which has gotten 54 votes in terms of a funding plan and is based on models that every Member of the Senate knows about, is a very appealing kind of concept. But if our colleagues have different approaches--and certainly in this body we have strong views, and there are a variety of different ideas on this--have them come forward. 
   But let's not duck this issue. Let us not duck it and say, oh, this is a matter for the 2000 campaign, and we don't need to deal with it today. We need to deal with it now. 
   I am going to go through a couple of other cases. 
   Here is another one from a couple in Cornelius, OR, a home in my State. They have a monthly income of about $1,000. They are spending between $200 and $400 every month on their prescription drugs. They have to take drugs for arthritis, for cholesterol problems, and antibiotics on a fixed income. 
   Clearly, this kind of case where month after month they are seeing between 20 percent and 40 percent of their monthly income going for prescription drugs ought to make it clear to Members of this body that we have to move and move on a bipartisan basis. 
   There isn't anything that is important in Washington, DC, that isn't bipartisan. I don't know of a single issue that can be addressed in a significant way without Democrats and Republicans coming together. The Snowe-Wyden bipartisan approach is one way. There may be others. But the important thing is we ought to move and we ought to move in this session of Congress. 
   A third case I would like to go through involves an elderly woman in Forest Grove, OR. Recently, in effect, in the last few weeks, she spent $294 on her prescription medicine. She has had to take a variety of different medicines. That is one example of what we are getting now from the seniors across this country. This particular senior is in Forest Grove, OR, taking a whole host of medications.  
   A lot of our seniors average 15 prescriptions a year. The third case I have gone through this morning with seniors spending $294 in just a few weeks on her prescription medicines in Forest Grove is pretty representative of what we are hearing. 
   I hope that as a result of my coming to the floor over these last days before we wrap up for the year that we can see Democrats and Republicans in the Senate coming together to try to deal with this question. 
   I want to bring up one last case. It is a particularly poignant one. It is from an older person who is now taking 15 prescription drugs. She is on a fixed income with nothing but her Social Security. She is spending $600 a month--$600 a month--on her prescription medicine. None of it is covered by her health insurance. She writes to tell me that she is spending almost her entire monthly income on prescription drugs. 
   Think of that. A senior citizen, again, at home in Oregon spending almost her entire monthly income on prescription drugs. We asked: What happens when you can't afford the prescription drugs you need? She said borrow. That is what she tries to do. A senior citizen with only Social Security spending virtually all of her monthly income on prescription drugs is now having to borrow from friends and family. 
   I have a list of these prescriptions. Again, the list goes on and on. 
   This is an example of the kind of bills that senior citizens are now sending in as a result of our efforts to try to get bipartisan action on this issue. 
   I hope as a result of my remarks other seniors will, as this poster says, send in copies of their prescription drug bills. I hope they will be interested in the bipartisan Snowe-Wyden prescription drug bill. But, frankly, I would like to make sure they are in contact with all of us in the Senate because this is not an issue that should be allowed to be put off until after the 2000 election. 
   We are given an election certificate. Mr. President, I know you feel very strongly about important issues such as campaign finance reform where it is important to come together. We are giving election certificates to deal with these issues. I have not been given an election certificate to put this off until after 
   another election. We are all sent here to deal with these important issues such as campaign finance reform and prescription drugs because these are important to the American people. 
   I am very proud to have been able to work with Senator OLYMPIA SNOWE on this issue. 
   I think when you are dealing with important questions such as prescription drugs and campaign finance reform it has to be bipartisan. My plan is to keep coming to the floor of the Senate day, after day, after day, bringing up these examples of what I am hearing from the Nation's senior citizens and hope that we can come together. Senator SNOWE and I got 54 votes on the floor of the Senate for the funding approach we are taking. More than $10 billion goes from the Medicare program each year to cover tobacco-related illnesses. We know we have to act. We have to act responsibly to address these concerns of seniors. 
   There is a marketplace-oriented approach to this problem. We don't need a lot of price controls. We don't need a ``one-size-fits-all'' run from a Washington, DC, program. The Snowe-Wyden bill will give seniors the same kind of bargaining power that a health maintenance organization has to negotiate prices, not through a government regime but through the power of marketplace forces. 
   I am going to keep coming back to the floor of the Senate until we get action on this issue. I will keep reading from these letters. I hope seniors will continue, as this poster says, to send in copies of their prescription drug bills. I know that seniors at home have made it clear they are going to keep sending them to me, and I am very hopeful that we can get action on this issue in this session. 
   I yield the floor. 
   Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, this is the eighth time in recent days I have come to the floor to talk about the issue of prescription drugs because, frankly, I think this is a priority for this session of the Congress and one we can tackle in a bipartisan way. 
   Senator OLYMPIA SNOWE and I have teamed up on a bipartisan bill. We were able to get 54 votes on the floor of the Senate for a concrete funding plan for our approach. 
   What I have been doing, as folks can see in the poster right next to me, is urging seniors to send in copies of their prescription drug bills. The poster is very clear. We would like seniors to send copies of their prescription drug bills directly to each of us in the Senate so we can emphasize how important it is that this be tackled in a bipartisan way. 
   Senator SNOWE and I have heard again and again that this is an issue that just has to be put off until after the 2000 election. The Republicans and Democrats are going to just bicker about it and sort of have an ongoing finger-pointing exercise and nothing will get done. 
   I happen to think there are a lot of Members of the Senate who want to tackle this issue and want to tackle it in this session of Congress. 
   Since I have come to the floor of the Senate and brought this poster urging seniors to send their prescription drug bills in, I have heard from a number of our colleagues in the Senate. They have said we need bipartisan action. A number of them have asked for copies of the bipartisan Snowe-Wyden bill. They want to know more about it. 
   I am going to continue tonight to read from some of these letters, particularly from folks I am hearing from in Oregon. But I want to take a few minutes tonight to talk about some important issues relating to this question of prescription drug coverage for senior citizens and particularly ask about this issue of whether we can afford, as a nation, to cover prescription medicine. 
   Mr. President and colleagues, I believe America cannot afford to not cover prescription drugs. The reason that is the case is that drugs in the 21st century are going to be preventive. 
   They are going to allow for patients to be treated on an outpatient basis and it will make part A of Medicare, the hospitalization part of Medicare, less expensive. 
   I mentioned a drug the other night, an important anticoagulant that helps to prevent strokes. It is a drug that would cost perhaps $1,000 a year to assist seniors. If we can prevent those strokes through the anticoagulant drugs, we can save $100,000 that might be incurred as a result of expenses associated with a disability. 
   There is one bipartisan bill before the Senate dealing with this prescription drug issue. It is the Snowe-Wyden legislation. My view is we can't afford to continue to pass up the opportunity to address these health care issues in a preventive way rather than incurring the extraordinary expenses for more institutional care. 
   I will mention a few of the drugs that will be particularly important to older people. One is Neupogen, which helps cancer patients and others with compromised immune systems boost their white blood cell counts and avoid hospital stays. Another is Glucophage, which is now being used to help those at risk for diabetes from getting that disease which causes so many other serious health problems. 
   My mom has had diabetes for a long time. I have seen the costs of these medicines. To think there is an opportunity with a particular drug to cover these seniors with their prescription drug bills seems to me to be an option as a nation we cannot afford to pass up. 
   Another drug is Vasotec, which treats high blood pressure and helps to stave off strokes and heart disease and other major problems. 
   These are all important medications. They do cost money, but the bottom line is we can use these medicines. When seniors receive these medicines, they are in a position to stave off much more serious and much more expensive problems. It is sensible, in my view, to make sure seniors who need these medications--that are preventive in nature--can get them. Under the bipartisan Snowe-Wyden bill, that would be done. 
   As far as I am concerned, in my reading of history, there is pretty much nothing that can get accomplished in the Senate that is truly important that isn't bipartisan. Our proposal gives each senior a chance at affordable prescription medicine. It ought to be recognizable to Members of Congress because a version of this model is what ensures good health for the families of Members of this body and the Congress. 
   Since my days with the Gray Panthers--I have been working on this prescription drug issue for many years now--I have seen how many seniors have to walk an economic tightrope, balancing their food against their fuel costs and their fuel costs against their medical bills. We have now more than 20 percent of the Nation's older people paying more than $1,000 per year for prescription drugs. The typical senior is using 18 prescriptions a year.  
   One constituent from Medford, OR, wrote that from a modest income he spent more than $1,230 so far this year on prescription medicines. 
   The typical senior is taking 18 different prescriptions. I hope, as a result of this effort to collect these drug bills from seniors, we can actually get some relief for people in this country who are facing such serious and urgent health care needs. 
   Some have said we ought to wait until after the next election, we ought to wait for comprehensive Medicare reform. I know the Presiding Officer believes strongly in this. There are a lot of Members who want to see broader, more comprehensive Medicare reform. Under the Snowe-Wyden prescription drug proposal, we are using the kind of principles that make sense for Medicare in the 21st century. It is choice-oriented. It gives a lot of options to older people. We use marketplace forces to contain costs. 
   It has worked for Members of Congress and their families. I think it can work for my constituents at home in Oregon. I think it can work for the older people of this country. I am hopeful in the days ahead we can make the case for why it is important the Senate Act in this session. 
   The question of prescription drugs and will Congress tackle it now--all of the political prognosticators have said this is an issue the Congress is going to punt on. They have said this is an issue that is going to have to be put off. I don't see how, when seniors are sending copies of their prescription drug bills, a Member of this body, a Member of this Congress, can say we ought to put this issue off when there is a model that 54 Members of the Senate have voted for, that has strong bipartisan support, that uses marketplace forces as a model. Let's not say this is something that ought to be put off. 
   I think we know what needs to be done. I think we can do it in a cost-effective fashion. Our bill doesn't involve price controls. Some seem to think that is the way to go. What troubles me about plans to deal with prescription drug costs that involve price controls, we will have massive cost-shifting. 
   If we have Medicare acting as the buyer for all the medicine, it may be possible for the Government to negotiate a discount. I have always said that might be possible. What troubles me about that approach is we will have the cost passed on to someone else who might be 26 or 27--maybe a divorced mom who has a couple of kids--working as hard as they can, and all of a sudden they find out their prescription drug bill shoots up because Congress adopted an approach in this area that doesn't use marketplace forces. 
   Under the bipartisan Snowe-Wyden plan, the only bipartisan prescription drug bill now before the Senate, we reject those cost controls. We don't advocate a one-size-fits-all Federal approach. We use marketplace forces, the kind of forces that help deliver decent and affordable care to Members of this body and our families. 
   I want to read briefly from a couple of the other letters I have received from Oregon. I will keep coming back to the floor of the Senate again and again until we get bipartisan action on this prescription drug issue. I think the question of prescription drugs is the kind of issue that can leave a legacy for this session. It is the kind of important question that will help folks and help families at a time when a lot have fallen between the cracks. We know the economy is strong. We know a lot of people are doing well. If they happen to be in the stock market, most of the time they are doing very well. But there are a lot of folks who don't have the stocks in the technology companies, a lot of folks are on modest incomes. A lot of the seniors I have worked with since my days with the Gray Panthers are telling me and telling other Members of the Senate they just can't afford their prescriptions. That is what this is about. They can't afford their prescriptions. 
   There is a right way and a wrong way to deal with that issue. The wrong way, in my view, is to have a price control regime and produce cost-shifting with intervention by Government. I don't think that will work. I think a lot of people will end up getting hurt by that approach. I think there would be a lot of unintended consequences. 
   The right kind of approach, the one advocated in the bipartisan Snowe-Wyden prescription drug bill, uses marketplace forces. It gives seniors the kind of bargaining power that health maintenance organizations would have. Those big organizations, the health maintenance organizations, can go out and negotiate deep discounts. They use their bargaining power in the marketplace to get discounts. What happens is seniors get shellacked twice. They get hit once because Medicare doesn't cover prescription drugs. 
   Medicare started out as half a loaf back in 1965. It did not cover prescriptions and eyeglasses and hearing aids and a variety of needs older people have. But as a result of the escalating costs of health care, a lot of seniors are paying more proportionately out of pocket today than when Medicare began in 1965. 
   So seniors are not able to afford their prescriptions, and that senior purchaser, a low-income elderly widow, in effect has to subsidize the big purchasers, the health maintenance organizations that can negotiate discounts. 
   There is a right way and a wrong way to deal with the issue of affordable medication. The wrong way is to create a one-size-fits-all Federal regime and put the Government in the business of trying to orchestrate this entire program. The other is to use a model that we know works. Under our proposal--we call it SPICE, the Senior Prescription Insurance Coverage Equity Act--Senator SNOWE and I, we reject this Government model. We use an approach that has private sector options and choices and gives seniors bargaining power. 
   We hope more older people will send us copies of their prescription drug bills. This poster really says it all to 
   seniors and their families:  
   Send us copies of your prescription drug bills.  
   Send them to your Senator. Write to:  
   Your Senator, U.S. Senate, Washington, D.C.  
   I am going to wrap up tonight--because I know several of our colleagues would like to discuss matters important to them--with just a couple of other letters. 
   From the Oregon coast in the last few days, I received a particularly poignant letter. It is from an individual with an income of about $1,000 per month. She has to take prescription medicine, a number of prescriptions. Over the last few months, out of her $1,000-a-month income, she has had to spend almost $700. That is just over the last few months, from somebody who is on a very modest income. 
   Picture any one of us, or our relatives, trying to get by on an income of $1,000 a month and having to spend a significant portion of it, around $700 just in recent days, on prescriptions. We know they would not be able to do it. But that is the reality of what seniors on the Oregon coast are facing. That is the reality of what seniors all over this country are facing. That is what the bipartisan Snowe-Wyden prescription drug bill seeks to deal with. We want that person to get some real relief. We think it is time for the Senate to act on a bipartisan basis. 
   One other letter I received from the Willamette Valley, not far from my hometown, I thought was also particularly poignant. This was from a senior who sent me, really, all of his prescriptions. Just as we said in our poster, send us copies of your prescription drug bills, I think a lot of the seniors are doing it in a pretty detailed fashion. This is just an example of what I received from one older person in the Willamette Valley. She reports, on a very modest income, she is spending $236 a month on her prescription drugs. As she reports, that is without the over-the-counter medication she also has to take. She is 78 years old. She is concerned about whether or not the Senate is going to act. She is pretty skeptical, just the way a lot of other seniors are in our country. What we need to show is this Senate is willing to tackle these issues and do it on a bipartisan basis. 
   The time for finger pointing and scapegoating on this issue is over. We cannot wait for another year, another full year, for action on this matter. We ought to move now. There is one bipartisan bill before the Senate, one which I believe can bring Democrats and Republicans together. I am going to keep coming back to the floor of the Senate to talk about the SPICE Program, the  Senior Prescription Insurance Coverage Equity Act. It is voluntary in nature. Nobody is required to change anything. No senior, no family, would be required to change anything in their buying practices should they choose to continue doing exactly what they are doing. But for millions of older people, the SPICE Program, the Senior Prescription Insurance Coverage Equity Act, will be a bargain. It will be a winner because it will give seniors the kind of bargaining power the big health maintenance organizations have had. 
   It is not right, in my view, to give those buyers significant power in the marketplace and just say seniors and families do not matter. In effect, that is what we are doing. We are telling them: You go on out and do your best, walk into a pharmacy, and even though you are subsidizing the big buyers, this Senate will not do anything about it. 
   I believe it is time for bipartisan action on this. I believe it is time to create an approach to cover prescription drugs under Medicare that uses the forces of the marketplace, that is bipartisan, and that helps hold costs down. I believe a lot of seniors cannot afford their prescriptions. There is a right way and a wrong way to deal with it. The bipartisan Snowe-Wyden legislation is what we think is the appropriate way to go. We are going to continue to come to this floor and talk about the need for action on it. 
   As this poster says, what will help is if seniors send in copies of their prescription drug bills. We urge seniors to send them to us and send them to their Senator here in the U.S. Senate, Washington, DC 20510, because that will help Members of the Senate to see how urgent is this need. 
   The need was great years ago, but it is getting even greater. Too many older people every week are having to make a choice between their food costs and their fuel costs and their fuel costs and their medical bills. Let us show we can deliver on this important issue. There is a bipartisan bill now before the Senate. We hope seniors, as this poster says, will be in touch with us to let us know their feelings on this important matter. 
   I intend to keep coming back to the floor of the Senate until we get action on this issue. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, and colleagues, this is the seventh time I have come to the floor of the Senate in recent days to talk about the issue of Medicare coverage for prescription drugs. The reason I do so is I think it is so important that before we wrap up our work in this session of Congress, we take action on this matter, given how many vulnerable senior citizens there are in this country who simply cannot afford their prescriptions. 
   There is just one bipartisan bill with respect to prescription drug coverage now before the Senate. It is a piece of legislation known as the SPICE Act, the Senior Prescription Insurance Coverage Equity Act. 
   It is a bipartisan bill on which I have teamed with Senator OLYMPIA SNOWE of Maine; and it is one that the two of us are very hopeful this Congress will act on before we conclude our work. 
   There are some who think this issue is too controversial and too difficult to tackle before the next election. I would note that it is going to be more than a year until the next election. We are going to have a lot of senior citizens who are walking on an economic tightrope, every week balancing their food costs against their fuel costs, and their fuel costs against their medical bills, who are not going to be able to pay for their prescriptions and their necessities if the Senate decides to duck this issue and put it off until after the next election. I think the reason we are sent here is to tackle issues and not just put them off until after the election. 
   Over the last few months, Senator SNOWE and I have worked with senior citizen groups; we have worked with people in the pharmaceutical sector, in the insurance sector, various public- and private-sector organizations; and we believe the SPICE legislation that we have crafted is the kind of bill that Members of the Senate can support. 
   In fact, as part of the budget, Senator SNOWE and I teamed up, and we offered a specific funding plan. And 54 Members of the Senate are now on record--they are now specifically on record--with respect to the Snowe-WYDEN funding plan for paying for prescription drug benefits. So we are now in a position, it seems to me, colleagues, to take specific action. 
   One of the reasons I have come to the floor tonight is my hope that we can really show how urgent this need is. 
   What I have done, as the poster next to me says, is urge senior citizens to send in copies of their prescription drug bills, directly to their Senator, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC. I have decided I am going to, in my discussions on the floor each evening, read a portion of the letters I am receiving from seniors at home in Oregon. 
   I read about one group in the newspaper the other day who said it is not really that urgent a need. More than 20 percent of the Nation's senior citizens are spending over $1,000 a year out of pocket for their prescription medicine. 
   I read a couple of nights ago about an elderly woman from southern Oregon whose income is just over $1,000 a month in Social Security. She spends more than half of it on her prescriptions. 
   Those are the kinds of accounts we are hearing again and again and again. The fact is, our senior citizens are getting shellacked twice. First, Medicare doesn't cover prescriptions. That is the way the program began in 1965. I was director of the Gray Panthers at home for about 7 years before I was elected to Congress. The need was very acute back then for prescription drug coverage. But today it is even more important, for two reasons. 
   First, the senior citizen, who not only gets no Medicare coverage for their prescriptions, is now subsidizing the big buyers such as the health maintenance organizations that are in a position to negotiate big discounts. These big buyers, the health maintenance organizations, have real bargaining power and clout. They go out and negotiate a discount; they get a break. If you are a senior citizen, for example, in Myrtle Creek, OR, or Philomath--I will read from those letters in a moment--you end up subsidizing those big buyers. I don't think that is right. 
   In addition, since the days when we began to push, with the Gray Panthers, for prescription drug coverage, a lot of the new, important prescriptions are preventive in nature. I described several days ago an important anticoagulant drug that can help with a variety of ailments relating to strokes. The cost of that anticoagulant drug is in the vicinity of about $1,000 a year. You have a full-scale stroke that can come about if you don't get the medicine, and the cost can be $100,000 a year. 
   When people ask me, can this country afford to cover prescription drugs under Medicare, my view is, our country cannot afford not to do it. As part of this campaign we have launched in the Senate to have seniors send in, as this poster says, copies of their prescription drug bills, Senator SNOWE and I have teamed up on a bipartisan kind of plan. I am going to read from these letters. I will take just a couple of minutes for that tonight. 
   Just a couple of days ago, I heard from a woman in Philomath, OR, who wrote me about her mother. Her mother had recently spent more than $2,220 on prescription drugs. The daughter said--this was particularly poignant, in my view--the only way her mother was able to, in effect, cover her prescription needs was that her mother was getting samples from the doctor. The fact that she spent more than $2,220 on prescription drugs and the year isn't even over yet is dramatized by the fact that the cost would be much greater were it not for the fact that she was getting samples to supplement what she was paying for. That is the kind of account we are hearing from seniors in Oregon, as they, as this poster 
   says, send in copies of their prescription drug bills. I hope we will get more of that. 
   We need to deal with this issue on a bipartisan basis. Senator SNOWE and I have chosen to model our program after the Federal Employees Health Benefit Plan. The SPICE proposal we introduced is sort of a senior citizens version of the Federal Employees Health Benefit Plan. The elderly population, of course, is different from that of the Federal workforce, but the model of trying to offer choices and options and alternatives to make sure there is competition in health care of the kind Senator GRAHAM has advocated in the past is very sensible. If it is good enough for Members of Congress, it certainly ought to be the kind of thing we look at to cover older people. It is especially important because it can be a model that prevents cost shifting on to other groups of citizens. 
   There are other proposals, for example, that in effect have Medicare sort of buying up all the prescription drugs and taking the lead as the purchaser. What concerns me about that approach is, I think you will have massive cost shifting on to other groups of individuals. Nobody in the Congress intentionally would want to see a proposal developed that would, in effect, give a discount to folks on Medicare and then just have the cost shifted over to somebody who was 27 years old and had a couple of kids and was working hard and doing their best to get ahead in life. We have to use marketplace forces to develop and implement this benefit. 
   The proposal I have introduced with Senator SNOWE is one that uses those marketplace forces. It would give seniors the kind of bargaining power a health maintenance organization and a big buying group would have, but it wouldn't involve a lot of price controls. It wouldn't involve a lot of micromanagement. It wouldn't be sort of one-size-fits-all health care. 
   As we go ahead with this bipartisan campaign, the bill on which Senator SNOWE and I have teamed up is, in fact, the only bipartisan measure now before the Senate. I am going to come to this floor as often as I can and urge seniors to send in copies of their prescription drug bills directly to their Senator and just keep bringing to our colleagues' attention the need for action on this issue.  
   The second letter I want to describe tonight comes from an elderly couple from my hometown in Portland who said they have already spent $1,750-plus on their prescription drug costs so far this year. They wrote: We have saved all our life, never knowing what health problems would befall us. We are glad to pay our fair share, but the cost of prescription drugs is eating up our savings. 
   Finally, a constituent from Myrtle Creek has written that recently they spent $700 on prescription medicines. This exceeds the so-called average many of the experts in the beltway are talking about as not being that big a deal for senior citizens. This is a bill incurred by an older person from Myrtle Creek. We hear the same thing from Portland, OR. We hear the same thing from Philomath, OR. This is what we are hearing all across this country. 
   It would be a terrible shame, in my view, for the Senate to say we are not going to act, we are going to let this become a big campaign issue in the 2000 election, and Democrats and Republicans can engage in a lot of finger pointing and, in effect, sort of put out that the other side doesn't care, the other side isn't interested. We will end up seeing this issue drag on well into the next century. 
   I believe the Snowe-Wyden legislation, the only bipartisan bill now before the Senate on prescription drugs, may not be the last word on this issue. It is not going to be enacted into law with every I dotted and every T crossed, as it has been proposed thus far, but I do believe it can serve as a model. 
   It is bipartisan. Fifty-four Members in the Senate are already on record as having cast a vote for the specific plan we have to fund this program. 
   And so the opportunity to make the lives of older people in this country better, to help those who are scrimping and not taking their drugs the way they ought to, to be able to do it in a way that uses marketplace kinds of forces and provides choices and options, just the way our families get, seems to be an opportunity we cannot afford to pass up. 
   I know Senator GRAHAM, who has done good work on the health care issue and the prescription issue as a member of the Finance Committee, is here to talk. The hour is late. But I intend to keep coming to the floor of the U.S. Senate and pushing for action on this issue. There is a bipartisan bill before the Senate now. This would be the kind of issue that could be a legacy for this session of the Congress. I intend to keep coming to the floor of the U.S. Senate, reading from the letters I am getting from home, urging seniors to do as this poster says: Send in copies of your prescription drug bills. 
   I intend to come back to this floor again and again and again, until we get action on this matter. For years, since the days when I was director of the Oregon Gray Panthers at home, I have had a dream that the U.S. Congress would make sure that older people who aren't taking their medicines because they can't afford it would be able to get this coverage. 
   The opportunity to team up with Senator SNOWE has been a real pleasure for me. She has been speaking out on this issue. I will continue to speak out on it, and we are going to do everything we can to make sure the U.S. Senate acts on this question and does it in this session of the Congress. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, this is the sixth time I have come to the floor in recent days to talk about Medicare coverage for prescription medicine and particularly to talk about bipartisanship. I want to talk about this issue of prescriptions for senior citizens. 
   I am very pleased to see my good friend and colleague from Oregon in the chair. He has been extremely supportive of the effort Senator SNOWE and I have been making over these last few months to try to show that we can deal in a bipartisan manner with this issue of prescription drugs for the Nation's elderly. I think a lot of people have pretty much consigned this issue to part of the campaign trail in the fall of 2000 and that Republicans and Democrats are just going to fight about it and nothing is going to get done. But what Senator SNOWE and I have been talking about for the last few weeks is that we ought to act on this now; we ought to deal with it in this session of Congress. I thank the Chair, my friend and colleague from Oregon, because he has been very supportive. 
   I am going to read this afternoon, as I have done on five previous occasions, from some of the letters we are getting from seniors across the State of Oregon who are concerned about this issue. In fact, this is part of a campaign Senator SNOWE and I are making to urge seniors across the Nation, as we say in the 
   poster, to send in their prescription drug bills. We hope they do send them to their Senators, in the hopes that we can galvanize bipartisan action in this session. It is more than a year until the next election. It would be a shame, with all of the suffering and hardship we are seeing in these letters, to have the Senate just take a pass on this issue and say, well, we will deal with it some other time and on some other day. 
   So I am going to, as I have on five previous occasions, read from some of these letters in an effort to try to make the case for bipartisanship and action in this session. 
   One senior from Lebanon wrote recently that she has about $990 per month in income. This senior spends about $175 of that for just one prescription each month. That leaves this older person a little over $700 a month on which to live. Think about what it is actually like for a senior citizen on a $990-a-month income to spend $175 of that for just one prescription each month. It is pretty clear that you just can't pay for necessities if you have to pay out of your monthly income that very large prescription drug bill. 
   It would be one thing if that letter were a rarity, but here is another letter I got recently from a couple in The Dalles, OR--the Chair and I have been in that community often--who has to spend something like $1,500 a year for tamoxifen, a drug used to fight cancer. It is very clear that with their other health expenses, their dental work, eyeglasses, a variety of things that Medicare doesn't cover, this couple in The Dalles, OR, is walking on an economic tightrope, having to balance food costs against fuel costs, their fuel costs against their medical bills. 
   So I am very hopeful that, as a result of this campaign Senator SNOWE and I are making to urge seniors to send in their prescription drug bills, we are going to have a chance to respond in this session. 
   I see our good friend, Senator MOYNIHAN. He has really led in the area of health research and prevention. We talked a little bit about it on Friday last. What is so important about this issue and dealing with it in this session of Congress and not in 2001--by the way, we won't have the good fortune of having Senator MOYNIHAN as a Member of this body then. The reason we ought to deal with it now is that the drugs seniors need most are preventive in nature. 
   Back when I was director of the Gray Panthers, which was for about 7 years before I was elected to the Congress--and I think the Chair was still practicing law at that time. It is clear that these new drugs can make a tangible, significant difference in the lives of our elderly people. I talked about a drug last week, an anticoagulant that a senior could get for just over $1,000 a year; and if they take that medicine, it can prevent strokes and debilitating illnesses that can cost more than $100,000 a year. Think of it--a modest, preventive investment in an anticoagulant drug, helping us to save $100,000 that seniors might need to treat a debilitating stroke. 
   I am going to be brief this afternoon. I am going to wrap up with a few additional cases. 
   In Portland, I was told by a constituent about her mother and father. They are 83 and 79 years old. Right now at their home in Portland, OR, they are being treated for diabetes, hypertension, and a variety of illnesses relating to arthritis. They have a monthly income of $1,600 a month. They are spending more than $400 of it on prescription medicine--25 percent of their monthly income for an older couple 83 and 79 in our home State of Oregon just for prescription medicine. 
   From Silverton, OR, a senior sent me a copy of all of her prescription drugs for 1 year. She spent more than $1,000. Her annual income that year was $868 a month. She is spending more than 10 percent of her income on prescription drugs. 
   From Astoria, OR, a couple on a modest income wrote that for the first 10 months of 1999 they spent over $5,000 on their prescription drug costs. 
   What Senator SNOWE and I have said is that we have an opportunity to deal with this on a bipartisan basis. We can steer clear of price controls and one-size-fits-all Federal policy. We can use a model that we know works. It is based on the Federal Employee Health Plan, one that serves all of us and our families here in the Senate. 
   Our bill is called the SPICE Program, the Senior Prescription Insurance Coverage Equity Act. 
   Our legislation now is the only bipartisan prescription drug bill now before the Senate. 
   Frankly, I am very confident in the bipartisan team I see assembled from the Finance Committee with Chairman ROTH and Senator MOYNIHAN. 
   I would like to see as a result of seniors sending in to all the Senators--as this poster says, ``Send in your prescription drug bills''--I would like to see the Senate Finance Committee have the opportunity under Chairman ROTH and Senator MOYNIHAN to devise a good bipartisan proposal in this area. 
   Senator SNOWE and I have an approach that we think works. More than 54 Members in the Senate have voted for the funding mechanism we have proposed. We have a majority in the Senate already on record supporting the funding approach that we would take. 
   Frankly, when Chairman ROTH and Senator MOYNIHAN sit down, they may well have better ideas for dealing with it. It is not as if Senator SNOWE and I are saying we have the last word in terms of dealing with this issue. What we are saying is given the severity of the problem, given the stakes and the chance to do some real good with anticoagulant drugs where $1,000 a year worth of help can save $100,000 in terms of the cost of a stroke, let's go forward, and let's not let this issue become fodder for the 2000 election. 
   I am going to wrap up because the chairman and Senator MOYNIHAN are here. They want to talk about this important trade bill, which I also happen to support. 
   But I hope seniors will keep sending me copies of these bills. Just as the poster says, ``Send your prescription drug bills'' to your Senator. Senator SNOWE and I are collecting these. 
   We are going to talk again and again on the floor of the Senate about the importance of this issue. 
   I think we can do this with market forces. We can use an 
   approach that gives senior citizens the kind of bargaining power that a health maintenance organization has. 
   What is so sad about this is these vulnerable older people, such as the  ones I have described in these letters, are getting hit twice. 
   First, Medicare doesn't cover their prescriptions. When the program began in 1965, it didn't cover the cost of prescriptions. So there is no coverage either under Part A or Part B of Medicare for most of the Nation's seniors. 
   Second, the seniors end up subsidizing the big business. Big buyers can get discounts. 
   So you have big buyers, health plans, and a variety of big purchasers using their marketplace clout in order to get a good price, and the senior citizen in Silverton or Pendleton, the Presiding Officer's hometown, who walks in and buys their prescription off the street ends up subsidizing those big buyers. That is not right. 
   Senator SNOWE and I are going to continue to try as a result of our conversation with colleagues to catalyze a bipartisan effort to address this issue. 
   I think the question of adding prescription drugs to Medicare would be a real legacy for this session of the Senate. 
   I think about all of the accomplishments of Senator MOYNIHAN in this health care field over the years, what he has done in terms of graduate medical education, and what he has done in research is extraordinary. I would like to see as part of the great legacy that he leaves for his career in the Senate action on this bipartisan issue before he retires at the conclusion of this session of Congress. 
   Mr. President, I will be back on the floor--I know Senator SNOWE intends to as well--talking about this issue. We hope seniors send us a copy of their prescription drug bills. We are going to address this issue in a bipartisan way. I will be back on the floor soon to talk about this issue and bring other real, live, concrete cases to the Senate in hopes, as the Presiding Officer of the Senate and I have done at home in Oregon, we can work on this in a bipartisan kind of way. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, in this era of partisanship, harsh sound bites and bitter politics, JOHN CHAFEE wanted to have none of that. He was, in my view, the gold standard as far as public service is concerned. He wasn't full of himself, always humble and low key, always bipartisan. 
   I especially admired that he was always standing up for people without power and without clout. I think of all the times over the years I had a chance to serve with him--close to 20 years--  that JOHN CHAFEE stood up for children, stood up for the disabled, stood up for folks who are always falling between the cracks in the health care system, people who never had a voice. 
   Reflecting on his background--a family of means, Ivy League education--one would not think a person with those roots would be there for the kind of causes and the kind of people JOHN CHAFEE was for again and again during these years in public service. 
   His contributions are going to be documented in many areas but especially in the areas of health care and the environment. We all ought to take some time and reflect on what JOHN CHAFEE contributed to our country. His fingerprints are on every hallmark piece of environmental legislation, going through two decades, in terms of clean air and clean water.

   Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, before he leaves the floor, I want to tell the majority leader I very much share his view about this threat of narcoterrorism, and also to express my appreciation to the majority leader for the work he is doing with several of us on this matter of secret holds, which are so relevant at the end of a session. We have made a lot of progress already with the work done by the majority leader and with Senator DASCHLE. The majority leader knows we are trying to work out some of the last kinds of questions. I want the majority leader to know I think we have already made a real difference in this area. 
   I express my support to him and look forward to wrapping up the last remaining issues. I think we all know, as we go into the last few days of the session, we can have 100 of these secret holds and Senators rushing about trying to figure out what is going on. Senator MOYNIHAN, in his landmark study on secrecy, has really made the case that secrecy is the most expensive kind of regulation we could have. 
   Before the majority leader leaves the floor, I want him to know I really appreciate all the progress we have made in working with his staff, Mr. Wilkie doing yeomen work on this, and I look forward to wrapping it up.

   Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, rare is it to have an opportunity to talk about health care policy when the chairman of the Health Care Subcommittee is on the floor with Mr. MOYNIHAN, a long time expert, and Dr. FRIST is in the chair. So you have three of the most influential people in the health care policy field before you. 
   I will not abuse this opportunity. But I wanted to take just a few minutes to talk about this prescription drug issue and its importance, in terms of coverage under Medicare. There is now one bipartisan bill before the Senate on this issue, and that is the legislation that Senator OLYMPIA SNOWE and I have proposed. 
   What I have said--this is the fifth time I have come to the floor in recent weeks--is I am actually going to, as this poster says, ``Urge Senior Citizens To Send In Copies Of Their Prescription Drug Bills,'' so we can show just how critical this issue is and come together on a bipartisan basis before the end of this session and get prescription drug coverage added to Medicare. 
   What Senator SNOWE and I have proposed, on a bipartisan basis, uses marketplace forces to hold down the cost of these prescriptions. We have an ``ability to pay'' feature in the program. That is something I have heard Senator MOYNIHAN and Dr. FRIST talk about. My sense is, it is critically important that we get this coverage, not just because senior citizens suffer so, but because this is the next breakthrough in preventive health care. The drugs we are seeing today help to lower blood pressure; they help to lower the cholesterol level. 
   I have heard Senator MOYNIHAN and Chairman ROTH talk, for 
   example, about how costs are exploding in Medicare, particularly under Part A, the hospital portion of Medicare. It seems to me if we can come together on a bipartisan basis and address this prescription drug issue, a lot of these new drugs, these preventive drugs, will help us save money and hold down some of the costs in Part A of Medicare, the hospital and institutional portion of the program. 
   The Wall Street Journal pointed out yesterday, again, how staggering some of these costs are and how we might prevent them with thoughtful policy work in the health care area. For example, yesterday in the Wall Street Journal they noted that one-third of all stroke survivors are permanently disabled. But doctors can now prescribe anticoagulants to protect the high-risk patients from stroke. The Journal goes on to say:  
   The lifetime cost of a severe stroke is $100,000, while treatment with anticoagulants costs $1,095. This is a chance to get good coverage for vulnerable people in our country and save taxpayers' money at the same time.  
   I am just very hopeful; Senator ROTH's staff and Senator MOYNIHAN's staff have spent a lot of time with us already. Senator SNOWE and I want to do this in a bipartisan way. We want to act in this session of Congress, not put it off until after yet another round of electioneering and more slugging back and forth between Democrats and Republicans. I am hopeful seniors, by sending in copies of their prescription drug bills, as Senator SNOWE and I advocate, will help us come together in a bipartisan way. 
   In wrapping up, as I have indicated to the Senate before, I am going to bring to the floor each time I come three cases of what I am hearing from seniors at home in Oregon, to dramatize how important it is we act on this matter. 
   I just heard yesterday from a 75-year-old widow from Salem, OR. She wrote me that her income is $8,218 a year; her prescription drug bill is $2,289. 
   She spent that on three drugs--Fosamax, Relafen, and Paxil. Three drugs, $2,289 from her $8,118 income. That is an elderly woman in Salem. 
   A woman in Portland wrote me:  
   My mother is 97 years old and will soon be required to file for Medicaid because the ever-increasing cost of her care and medications have depleted her savings. Currently, her expenses exceed income by over $1,000 per month. In some months, her medication costs over $300. Last year, her prescription drug bill was $2,746.  
   As we saw in a recent study, more than 20 percent of the Nation's elderly are spending over $1,000 a year out of pocket on their prescription medicines. This story was not at all something we found to be rare or out of the ordinary. 
   Finally, the third case I want to mention this morning comes from a woman in Seaside, OR. She has an income of just over $1,000 a month. She wrote me yesterday:  
   I am supposed to take 20 milligrams of Lipitor, but I do not have enough money to buy it.  
   These are the kinds of cases I know we are going to hear when seniors send in copies of their prescription drug bills. The question is, Can we come together in a bipartisan way to address this issue? 
   Senator SNOWE and I used the Federal Employee Health Benefits Plan as  our model. There are other good ideas out there. Our bill is called SPICE, the Senior Prescription Insurance Coverage Equity Act. We are not saying this is the last word on how to address this issue, but I would like to see the Senate look at an approach that utilizes marketplace forces, along the lines of what we do in the Federal Employee Health Benefits Plan and one that will not produce a lot of cost shifting on to other groups of vulnerable people. 
   For example, there is one proposal going around, certainly well-meaning, which has Medicare buying up all the drugs for the Nation's senior citizens. I am very fearful what will happen under that approach is we may control prices for the elderly, but you could have a divorced woman, a 27-year-old, say, African American women in my State or the Presiding Officer's State. She could see her drug bill go through the roof because prices would be controlled in just one segment of the pharmaceutical area, the Medicare area, and the costs would be shifted on to somebody else's back. 
   I know the Senate has a lot of important business. By the way, I am with Senator MOYNIHAN and Chairman ROTH on this great bill as well. I know they want to go on to that important matter. I intend to keep coming to the floor. Senator SNOWE had to be in Maine today and could not be here. We have already done this together. We urge seniors to send in copies of their prescription drug bills. 
   We hope they will back the bipartisan Snowe-Wyden bill. Frankly, I would rather hear from them so as to bring this Senate together in a bipartisan way and deal with this issue. Let's not let it become fodder for the 2000 election. Let's make this issue a legacy of this Congress where we really came together to do something important, something that is the wave of the future in American health care, which is to give good preventive approaches, wellness-oriented approaches as part of our American health system. 
   I thank Chairman ROTH and Senator MOYNIHAN and my friend, 
   Senator AKAKA, for indulging me this morning. I yield the floor.

   Mr. WYDEN. I thank the Senator from New Hampshire for yielding the floor. I know he waited a long time yesterday to speak, and I have waited as well. I thank the Senator for his courtesy. 
   I take the opportunity for a few minutes this afternoon to talk about an issue of enormous importance to millions of older people and their families. Specifically, it is the question of including prescription drug coverage under Medicare for the Nation's older people. 
   There is one, just one, bipartisan bill before the Senate to offer this vital coverage to the Nation's elderly. I have teamed up on this bill with Senator OLYMPIA SNOWE of Maine because the two of us believe it is critical that the Congress address this issue now and address it on a bipartisan basis. So Senator SNOWE and I, in an effort to get this issue out of the beltway, beyond Washington, DC, as you can see in the poster next to me, are urging that seniors send in copies of their prescription drug bills. Just as this poster says, send copies of their prescription drug bills to their Senator, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC 20510. 
   What we are going to do, in an effort to get bipartisan support for our legislation, is come to the floor every few days--this is the fourth time I have come to the floor of the Senate--and  read directly from letters we are receiving from the Nation's elderly people. Here is one I just received yesterday from an elderly person in Central Point, OR. She wrote:  
   Dear Senator WYDEN, I write to ask for your support for Medicare coverage of prescription medicine. In my case such coverage is a financial necessity. I suffer from rheumatoid arthritis. My physician recommends that I use medicine to combat it. The only problem I have is that the dosage I require would require an annual outlay in excess of $1,000 a month. I desperately wish I could have the relief Enbrel could give me. Please champion coverage.  
   Another letter I received from my home community, from an elderly widow, states that her Social Security is $1,179 a month. Each month, from that $1,179 check, she spends $179 on the medicine Fosamax, $209 a month on Prilosec, $112 on Lescol; that is $500 a month, each month, for her prescription medicine from her monthly Social Security check, which is the only income she has. Almost half of her income goes to pay for her prescription drug bills. 
   Here is a letter I have just received from King City, OR. The writer says:  
   I am a constant user of Lovenox inhaler. Two uses per day come to $839. Fortunately, I drove a Chevrolet when my friends were driving Cadillacs, and our family vacation was spent in the U.S. not the South Seas, so I may be able to carry the load at least for a while. My annual cost for this one medicine is $30,600, just about what it would equal to stay in a nursing home.  
   These are just a few of the bills that are coming into my office, coming into Senator SNOWE's office, and our colleagues' here in the Senate as a result of the concern among the Nation's senior citizens that this issue be addressed. I hope we will see that more senior citizens follow just as we say in this poster: ``Send in your prescription drug bills.'' 
   The Snowe-Wyden legislation is bipartisan. It uses market forces to hold down the cost of medicine. That is the biggest problem, holding down the enormous cost of these medicines. More than 20 percent of the Nation's senior citizens spend over $1,000 a year out of pocket on their prescription medicine, and the bipartisan Snowe-Wyden bill would use a market-oriented approach to address this issue. It is modeled on the Federal Employee Health Benefit Plan. Our view is, if health care is good enough for Members of Congress, we certainly ought to look at using that kind of approach for the Nation's seniors. We call it the SPICE bill, the Senior Prescription Insurance Coverage Equity Act, because we would cover all of the Nation's older people eligible for Medicare. It is absolutely key that we do this now. 
   When people ask, ``Can we afford to cover prescription drugs under Medicare?'' my response is: ``We cannot afford not to cover prescriptions any longer.'' The reason for that--and I know my colleague currently in the Chair was involved in aging issues when he was in the House and was involved with Social Security, so he is familiar with this. We know the most important drugs that would be covered under the Snowe-Wyden legislation are preventive drugs. They help to deal with blood pressure problems and cholesterol problems. They keep people healthy and well, and they keep them fit. That helps hold down the cost for what is called Medicare Part A, the acute care portion of Medicare that covers hospitals and institutional services. Under the Snowe-Wyden approach, we contain costs without shifting them onto the backs of somebody else. 
   One of the things that concerns me, there is a well-meaning bill that has been introduced that suggests we ought to have Medicare buy up all the drugs and act as a buyer for everybody. The problem with that approach is that it will result in tremendous cost-shifting onto the backs of other Americans who are having difficulty paying for their prescription drug bills. I don't want to see a 27-year-old divorced African American woman with two kids, who is working hard, playing by the rules and doing everything she can to get ahead, have to see a big increase in her prescription drug bill because the costs are shifted onto her when somebody doesn't think about the implications of trying to do this through approaches that don't involve marketplace forces. 
   So these are letters I am receiving from seniors across the country. Here is another one from Myrtle Creek, OR. This is a 
   senior citizen who has to take a variety of medicines, including Albuterol, Dulcolax, and other drugs. She writes me that she spent $370 recently on prescription drugs from a Social Security check of $1,152. She went to a small drugstore in Myrtle Creek, OR--a terrific small community--and spent $370 from a Social Security check of $1,152 on her medicines. 
   I think a lot of these seniors are asking themselves, what is it that the Senate is so busy doing that it cannot work in a bipartisan way to be responsive to older people and families on this issue? I am very hopeful that if seniors just read what it says in this poster: ``Send in your prescription drug bills'' to Senators--Senator SNOWE and I are particularly interested in hearing from older people because we want to do this in a bipartisan way. A lot of people think the prescription drug issue is just going to be fodder for the campaign in the year 2000 and in the fall of 2000 we will just have the Democrats and Republicans slugging it out on the issue. The last time I looked, it was more than a year until that election comes up. 
   I don't want to see seniors such as the ones I am hearing from in Myrtle Creek and King City, and all over the Willamette Valley in my home State--I don't want to see them suffer. I know the Chair doesn't want to see people suffer in Kentucky. Other colleagues feel the same way. If we can put down the partisanship for a little while and work together in an effort to get the vulnerable seniors across this country the coverage they need, we will have a truly lasting legacy from this session of the Senate. 
   I was codirector of the Gray Panthers, a great senior citizens group, for about 7 years before I was elected to the Congress. Some of my most joyous memories are working with older people back then. We talked about how important it was to cover prescriptions. 
   Well, what has happened with the evolution of the pharmaceutical sector over those 20 years is, prescription drugs have become even more important since those days when I was codirector of the Gray Panthers; the drugs are even more important now because they do so much to promote wellness. We needed them before because you do need medications for so many who are acutely ill. But today, this could result in keeping people healthy and save Medicare, particularly the institutional part of the program, Part A, that it could save Medicare Part A money and we could do it through marketplace forces. 
   Snowe-Wyden doesn't go out and set up a price control regime. We give senior citizens the kind of bargaining power a health maintenance organization would have through the marketplace. Seniors would get to choose the various kinds of coverages that are available to Members of Congress, such as the President of the Senate and myself. It would not be bureaucratic. We know our health care doesn't create a whole lot of new redtape and bureaucracy. We know it works. So that is what Senator SNOWE and I are trying to do. 
   This is the fourth time I have come to the floor of the Senate to urge seniors, as this poster says, to send in their prescription drug bills. I intend now to come back to the floor of this Senate every few days until this session ends and read, as I have, directly from copies of these prescription drug bills I am receiving. 
   I know that so many Senators care about the needs of the elderly. I see Senator CHAFEE, who has long been an expert in health and a member of the Finance Committee; our friend, Senator MIKULSKI, who has championed the Older Americans Act issue so passionately for so many years in the Appropriations Committee. 
   When we have these colleagues who have expertise in these issues and we know how acute the need is and we know we can do it in a bipartisan way, as Senator SNOWE and I have been trying to do, it would be a tragedy for the Senate to pass on this issue and say: Well, let's just put it off until after the year 2000. 
   We have consulted with senior groups. We have consulted with the insurance industry. We have consulted with those in the pharmaceutical sector. All of them have told us that our  bill, while perhaps not their first choice for how to ensure that seniors get their coverage, will work. It will get seniors the help they need, and it will be something that we can do and do now--not after the 2000 election, not after some other period of campaign activity, but it is something we can do now. 
   The Nation's seniors and our families can see as a result of my reading from these bills and what I am receiving from Oregon that I am very serious about their input. I hope that seniors and their families, as this poster says, will send in their prescription drug bill to their Senator. I hope they will be for the bipartisan Snowe-Wyden bill. Frankly, I am much more interested in hearing from them about the need for Congress to act. We can act. We can do it. 
   I yield the floor.

    Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I am pleased today to recognize the 55th anniversary of Electro Scientific Industries, Incorporated, ESI, and to honor the accomplishments of Mr. Douglas C. Strain, ESI's founder and first president and chairman of ESI's board. 
   Established in Portland in 1944, ESI was among the first high-technology companies in Oregon. Since that time, ESI has grown into a global leader in the manufacturer of precision laser trimmers and memory repair equipment, as well as a worldwide supplier of electronic production equipment. From humble beginnings, ESI has become a $200 million company, employing more than 900 individuals in Oregon and around the world, and helping to establish Oregon as one of this country's high-tech capitals. 
   Accomplishments such as these are often born of tough challenges. Having overcome a devastating fire in the 1950's, ESI had to rebuild itself from the ground up, and has had to re-invent itself on a number of occasions since that time. The company has proven itself adept at adapting to the fast-pace that characterizes the high-technology sector. From test and calibration equipment, electron microscopy, and analog computing to laser trimming, memory repair and vision, handling, packaging, and drilling technologies, ESI products have always been at the leading edge of technology developments. 
   I especially pay tribute to a remarkable Oregonian, Electro Scientific's founder, Mr. Douglas C. Strain. On October 24, Doug will celebrate both his 80th birthday and his retirement from ESI's board of directors. Mr. Strain's vision and perseverance have brought the company successfully to the end of this century, and I believe that ESI will continue on with equal success well into the next century. I congratulate Doug on his accomplishments and wish him the very best as he undertakes new challenges in his life.

   Mr. WYDEN. I thank our colleague from Nebraska for his thoughtfulness. He has been waiting a long time, as well. 
   I am a supporter of the McCain-Feingold bill, this iteration, as with all others. It is an important step in the right direction. However, I believe the biggest problem is that campaigning in America has become a never-ending money chase. There is an election the first Tuesday in November. People sleep in on Wednesday and all the fundraising starts all over again on Thursday. It is truly a permanent campaign. 
   If I had my way, if I could write my version of what the Senate ought to do on campaign finance, we would look at some sort of approach along the lines of what is used in several countries in Europe. They confine their elections to several months over a period of a couple of years. Money can be raised. It has to be disclosed. It is spent. They have their election, and, heaven forbid, after a few months of campaigning, they go back to tackling the issues that all Members get an election certificate for--to improve health care, education, to try to stuff the nuclear genie back into the bottle, to create an opportunity for people who work hard and play by the rules. 
   We are, obviously, not going to get that kind of reform, although I have been amazed in the last few days when I have colleagues on both sides of the aisle say they like that and wish there was a bipartisan Senate task force to look at something similar. That really would be reform. We could spend most of our time doing a job for which we were elected. 
   For now, we are limited to steps that can be taken immediately that are effective. I have come to the floor this 
   afternoon to talk about a step that Senator JEFF BINGAMAN and I have developed. It is an important step in the view of Senator BINGAMAN and myself. It limits negative campaigning. 
   My view from personal experience is negative ads are similar to a virus.  They infect everyone with whom they come in contact. In the special election to replace Bob Packwood in the Senate, unfortunately I didn't say no to some of those media consultants who told me to win, I had to just rip in to our colleague, my friend, Senator GORDON SMITH, with negative ads. I should have known immediately that all those negative ads run contrary to everything I got involved with when I began the Gray Panthers in Oregon to try to practice good government, but I didn't step in when I should have on the negative ads, and I regret it to this day. 
   With a month to go before that special election, I did tell my consultants I could not stand any longer the stench of the negative ads, and I told them to take them off the air. Moreover, I apologized to the people of Oregon. I said I made an error in judgment and it would not happen again. I ran my 1998 campaign, I am proud to be able to say, without mentioning my opponent at all. 
   I believe candidates ought to stand by their ads. They ought to be directly responsible for their ads. What Senator BINGAMAN and I will propose later this week is an approach we call ``stand by your ad.'' Specifically, the Bingaman-Wyden proposal says a candidate who mentions his or her opponent in a campaign ad must do so in person in order to get the lowest unit rate for advertising. Under current Federal communications law, broadcasters are required to sell commercial air time to candidates for Federal office at the lowest available price, known as the lowest unit broadcast rate. That means for 45 days prior to a primary or primary runoff, for 60 days prior to a general election. In effect, everybody else in town--the car dealership, the restaurant, the tire manufacturer--has to subsidize politics. Their ad costs are greater because broadcasters have to give these cheaper rates during the election cycle. 
   I think it is time to hold candidates personally responsible for their ads. I am amazed to find that all across the political spectrum I am joined in support of this idea. For example, in the House of Representatives, my Oregon colleague, GREG WALDEN, is a broadcaster by profession. He doesn't think this is bureaucratic or hard to comply with. He introduced in the House, as I did in the Senate, the ``stand by your ad'' approach that says candidates who mention their opponent have to do it in person to get the lowest unit rate. No first amendment violation here.

   Mr. WYDEN. We have a proposal the law division of the Library of Congress believes is constitutional which has been introduced by broadcaster GREGG WALDEN, a conservative Republican serving in the other body. It is a chance to take a practical step to deal with these negative ads. I believe it is possible to have a real debate about public issues without taking an approach that coarsens the public dialog and alienates so many people from the political process. 
   I am very proud that Senator SMITH and I put out a bipartisan agenda for the people of our State. We said, on important things for our State, that politics is going to stop at the State's borders. We said we do not want a part of the negative politics practiced in that special election to replace Bob Packwood. Frankly, Senator GORDON SMITH  summed it up pretty well when we talked about those negative ads after he was elected to the Senate and people were talking about our working together. He asked me how I felt when he ran his ads; how my kids looked at those ads? 
   I said: Well, GORDON, they were pretty upset by those ads. 
   He said: What did you tell your daughter? 
   I said: GORDON, I said when you ran those ads, me looking like I hadn't shaved for a couple of weeks, like a convict who had just gotten out of prison, I told my daughter Lilly, ``GORDON SMITH doesn't mean those things. He's just kidding, Lilly. He doesn't mean those negative ads.'' 
   GORDON, to his credit, said on television to the people of Oregon: I want to tell Lilly Wyden she's right. I didn't really mean those things I was saying about her dad. 
   Madam President, colleagues, we all know that this system is out of kilter. We all know that. Clearly we are going to have to take some bold steps in a bipartisan way to put it back on track. But I ask my colleagues to look seriously at the proposal that Senator BINGAMAN and I will bring to the floor later this week. It is a practical step that we could take against the virus of negative ads, negative ads that produce this spiraling effect where each side runs one that is more negative than the previous one, and the public is alienated. 
   Our proposal, based on the analysis done by the law division of the Congressional Research Service, is constitutional. Frankly, it is a lot less intrusive than a variety of requirements imposed on broadcasters right now. Broadcast licensees have to comply with equal time and reasonable access provisions. The Supreme Court has upheld them. The proposal we made that broadcast licensees providing the lowest unit rate available to candidates actually make the candidates offer their statements in person is one I am absolutely convinced the Supreme Court will uphold. They upheld the equal time and reasonable access provision. They will uphold this one as well. 
   It is time to change the current communications law and require, when candidates reference their opponent in a radio or television ad, that they have to appear in order to qualify for the lowest unit rate. If they do not want the lowest unit rate, they can go about the business of having various anonymous groups and sources continue to attack their opponent. But I do not think there ought to be a constitutional right to a broadcasters subsidy--that is what we have today--and, fortunately, the Library of Congress agrees with me. I think candidates ought to stand by their ads. Candidates for public office in the future ought to have greater direct responsibility for their ads. 
   The amendment Senator BINGAMAN and I have prepared would do just that. It is a complement to the proposal offered by Republican Congressman GREGG WALDEN in the other body. I hope my colleagues will look favorably on it. As one who comes to the floor today to talk about this negative ad question with personal experience, I will tell you I believe this issue, this question of the corrosive, ugly pettiness that has dominated so much of television advertising, ought to be at the top of the list of the reforms we pursue in this body. It ought to be at the top of our priority list, to look at ways to root out of American politics the negative nature of so much of this debate. 
   We can have profound differences of opinion. We can have sharp and profound differences of opinion without letting politics fall into the gutter of the negative, petty, ugly kind of politicking, as we have seen so many good people--good people--get caught up in across this country. 
   My colleague, Senator BINGAMAN, will have more to say about our joint proposal when he comes to the floor. I ask, again, when we get to this issue later in the debate, our colleagues look favorably on a proposal that I think will make a real difference in American politics and will begin to drain the swamp that has contaminated so much of our public dialog. 
   Madam President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I think the distinguished Senator has made a very eloquent statement on this matter of 
   hate crimes. As we have seen so often on these issues of justice for gay folks, and when we are talking about issues relating to race, the issue always is brought out that in some way we are advocating ``special rights,'' or ``preferences,'' or something of this nature. I think what the Senator from Massachusetts is asking for--and perhaps he can speak to this--is simply to make it clear the U.S. Congress is going to draw a line in the sand against violence borne out of bigotry and prejudice. 
   We are not talking about special rights. We are not talking about preferences for one group because of their sexual orientation or race; we are talking about Americans' right to be free from violence borne out of prejudice and hatred. Is that what the Senator from Massachusetts is talking about?

   Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I think what the Senator from Massachusetts said is very important for our colleagues to focus on as we go to this conference, which I think will be starting in a few minutes. 
   My understanding is that the bipartisan proposal of the Senator from Massachusetts and Senator SPECTER does not, in any way, preempt State and local authority in this area. My understanding is that it is only if and when State and local authorities don't act against these morally repugnant crimes that the Senator from Massachusetts has described--that only then would the Federal Government come in. I will say, from my standpoint, what the Senator from Massachusetts is talking about certainly meets my definition of what ought to constitute compassionate conservatism. 
   I am very pleased that my colleague from Oregon, Senator SMITH, has joined with Senator SPECTER and others on the other side of the aisle. I so appreciate the leadership of the Senator from Massachusetts. I want him to know that I plan to stand shoulder to shoulder with him until we get this law passed. This is unacceptable. It is grotesque that this Congress would not take up this issue, and we cannot allow this issue to be ducked any further. 
   I thank my friend for yielding.

   Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I want to take a few minutes to talk about the effort I have launched with the other Senator from Maine, Ms. OLYMPIA SNOWE, around the only bipartisan effort now before the Senate to get Medicare coverage for prescription drugs for the Nation's senior citizens. 
   As my colleagues can see in this poster next to me, Senator SNOWE and I are urging that senior citizens send in their prescription drug bills to Members of the Senate in Washington, DC, to help show how important it is we address this issue in a bipartisan way for the millions of vulnerable elderly people. 
   Here are a few of the prescription drug bills I have received from senior citizens from my home area in the Pacific Northwest. I will take a few minutes this afternoon on behalf of Senator SNOWE and myself to talk about why this bipartisan issue is so very important. 
   Let me read from a letter sent October 1 from an elderly women in Lebanon, OR. She said:  
   Please find enclosed a copy of the prescription costs for the past 6 months. As you will note, the average cost each month is $236.92 without the over-the-counter medications I must take. Please make use of these figures any way you can in your effort to obtain prescription coverage for those of us receiving Medicare. I'm 78 years old and doubt if I will see the time prescriptions are a covered item. However, keep fighting for the next generation.  
   I want to tell this older person in Lebanon, at home in Oregon, that we are going to be fighting for her. We are not going to wait until the next generation to get older people the coverage they need. To think that this  Congress would say it is not critical to help this kind of vulnerable, elderly woman isn't acceptable to Senator SNOWE and me. We have a market-oriented approach, one that can hold down the costs of prescription medicine for the Nation's senior citizens. 
   On the basis of these bills that are being sent now to Senator SNOWE and me, I think we can show this Congress that the time to act, in a bipartisan fashion, is now and not after the next election or the next election after that. 
   Let me read from another letter I received on September 29 of this year from a gentleman, an elderly gentleman, in King City, OR. He said:  
   I am a constant user of inhalant. Two uses per day come to $839.80.  
   Imagine that, two uses a day: $839.80. 
   And he says:  
   Fortunately, I drove a Chevrolet when my friends were driving Cadillacs and our family vacations were spent in the United States, not the South Seas, so I'm able to carry the load, at least for a while.  
   The annual cost of this prescription medication for this older person in King City, at home, is $30,600. It equals what 
   it would cost to stay in a nursing home. 
   I am just hopeful that with more examples like this, where senior citizens send to Senator SNOWE and me copies of their prescription drug bills, we can win bipartisan support for this legislation before the end of this session. 
   Let me cite a third letter I received at the beginning of October. This is from an elderly woman--it came just a few days ago--whose Social Security income is $1,179 a month. She spends $500 of her monthly income of $1,179 on prescription drugs. She is taking Fosamax. That is a drug that costs $179 a month. She is taking Prilosec. It costs $209 a month. And she is taking Lescol, which costs $112 a month. So it takes $500 a month from the monthly income of $1,179 of an elderly woman in the Pacific Northwest. 
   Mr. President and colleagues, these bills that are being sent to Senator SNOWE and me do not lie; they tell the whole story. We are going to do everything we can to ensure that Congress acts on this matter, in a bipartisan way, in this session of Congress. 
   Just this week, I saw a story in one of the publications saying there was not a consensus around this issue. Senator SNOWE and I got 54 votes--a majority in the Senate--to join us in a funding plan for a prescription drug program. I am of the view that we cannot afford not to cover prescription drugs because so many of these prescription drugs today help to lower blood pressure and cholesterol and keep folks well. 
   What Senator SNOWE and I are proposing is a market-oriented approach. It is based on the model that is used for Federal employees. It is market driven. It has choices. We would not see the kind of price-control approach that is being advocated by some. I am very opposed to that kind of price-control orientation because what will happen is, if you just try to control prices for Medicare drugs, the costs will all be shifted to somebody else. 
   Senator SNOWE and I do not want to see a divorced mom at the age of 27, with a modest income and two kids, have to pick up all the extra costs. So we are going with a market-oriented approach. I hope that in the days ahead, as a result of bills such as this, and others that I know are being sent to our colleagues--and the campaign we have launched here on the floor so that seniors will, as this poster says, send in copies of their prescription drug bills--we can show the people of this country that we are not going to wait until the next election or the election after that; we are going to find a way to come together now to do the job we were elected to do, which is to work in a bipartisan way. 
   Unfortunately, that did not happen this week on the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. I wish it had. I am anxious to work with the Presiding Officer and my colleagues on the other side of aisle. We can do it on prescription drugs. We can do it on an issue that is foremost in the minds of millions of our families and our seniors. 
   We have 20 percent of the Nation's older people spending more than $1,000 a year out of pocket on their prescription medicine. 
   I described this afternoon an elderly woman with a monthly income of $1,179, who every month spends more than $500 on prescriptions. Let's show seniors such as that elderly woman who wrote from the Willamette Valley in my home State of Oregon that we can act now. She was skeptical. She has heard all the 
   oratory and all the partisan rhetoric on this issue, and she is understandably skeptical. 
   Senator SNOWE and I are trying to mobilize a bipartisan coalition in this Senate to act in this session so that older people can get decent prescription drug coverage under Medicare. We should not wait until the next election. We were elected to act now and to act in a bipartisan way. 
   I hope, as a result of this short statement today, that additional older people, as this poster says, will send us copies of the prescription drug bills with which they are faced. 
   Senator SNOWE and I intend to be back on this floor again and again and again through this session of Congress until we get action. We will be talking about it next week, and we are going to talk about it the following week and the week after that. It is not right to wait on an issue such as this that is so pressing to vulnerable older people such as those who have written me the letters I have described today. 
   I am very grateful to my colleague, the other Senator from Maine, who, by the way, has a long record of being an advocate for consumer issues as well. And she knows how much I enjoy working with her. I thank her for this courtesy this afternoon. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor. 
   Ms. COLLINS addressed the Chair.

   Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I come here today to ask a question, a question that is a mystery to the vast majority of Americans: Why will the United States Senate not ratify the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty? 
   If there were any issue debated in the history of this Senate that called for more sober reflection, more independent thought, it is how to end the proliferation and testing of nuclear weapons. This may be the greatest burden the United States will carry into the next millennium. 
   The United States was the first nation to develop and test nuclear arms. More than a half century ago we were the first, and so far only, nation to use those arms. Three years ago we were the first nation to sign this treaty that takes a step back from a nuclear-armed world. 
   No other nation in the world can possibly gain more than the United States does from this treaty. 
   The treaty holds real promise for putting an end to the international development of nuclear weapons. It removes the ability of belligerent nations to enhance their nuclear stockpile. It removes the ability to use nuclear test explosions to bully and threaten their neighbors. It removes the incentive to throw much-needed capital into an insatiable and wasteful weapons program. 
   The American people understand this simple logic better than some in this body. Over 84% of the American public understands that ratifying the CTBT is the best way to protect the United States against the threat of nuclear attack by other nations. They are not talking about defensive missiles, they are talking about an America where their children won't have to grow up as they did; under the shadow of nuclear annihilation. This treaty, they understand, is a first step toward that goal. 
   President Dwight D. Eisenhower was a five star general as well as a two term President of the United States. He led men in wartime against a real, living threat to the security of the United States. He led America at the beginning of the cold war, at the most dangerous time for nuclear confrontation in our history. He had a unique understanding of the needs and necessities of national security, an understanding that I don't believe any member of this chamber can pretend to possess. His view of a nuclear test ban treaty was this: that the failure to achieve such a ban, when the opportunity presented itself would ``have to be classed as the greatest disappointment of any administration, of any decade, of any time, and of any party.'' 
   Opponents of this treaty say we are letting down our guard, that we are leaving ourselves open to be overwhelmed. President Eisenhower understood clearly and personally the dangers of failing to prepare for war. But it was precisely this experience with war that led him to conceive of the test ban as a means of preserving the safety and security of the American people. 
   This clear and rational thinking has continued, at least with our senior military leaders. The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff is responsible for our entire national defense infrastructure. It is his duty to the American people to insure that our military forces, nuclear and conventional, are strong, prepared and able to provide for the common defense. Our current Chairman, 
   General Hugh Shelton, and Former Chairmen General Colin Powell, Admiral William Crowe, General John Shalikashvili, and General David Jones all believe firmly that, for the safety and security of the American people, the CTBT must be ratified. 
   President Bush signed into law a ban on American nuclear testing in 1992. As a matter of fact, we have not conducted a nuclear test for seven years. We have already stopped running this race. 
   Has this test ban, already in place domestically for the better part of a decade, harmed our nuclear stockpile? The President says no, our military leaders say no, and the men whose responsibility it is to maintain the weapons say no. The CTBT has the support of all of the directors of our national labs whose first responsibility is to ensure that our nuclear weapons stockpile functions safely and reliably far into the future. They confidently believe this treaty, and the continuation of the test ban, is in our national interest. 
   It's been seven years since we have conducted a nuclear test. We are no less safe then we were a decade ago. No one who is qualified to make the judgment believes that we need to resume testing in the future. 
   What would passage of this treaty mean? Without test explosions, a new nuclear state cannot know that their crude bombs will work. Only very recently, after decades, over one thousand tests, and thousands of nuclear bombs manufactured, did our bomb making experts feel confident enough to proceed without testing. Without testing no other state can achieve that level of confidence. 
   While testing continues there is always the possibility that a nation will develop a bomb that is smaller and more easily concealed, the perfect weapon with which to attack a superpower like the United States, perhaps even without fear of relation. Missile defenses cannot stop a bomb carried over our borders, but an end to testing can stop that bomb before it is even made. 
   What would the failure of Senate ratification of the CTBT mean? Failure by the Senate to ratify the Treaty would mean a future full of new and more dangerous weapons. It would make infinitely more difficult a new effort to prevent the proliferation and use of nuclear arms. Those states that are currently non-nuclear trust that, in exchange for not attempting to acquire or develop nuclear arms, the current nuclear states will cease using their own. 
   The Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, the cornerstone of our efforts to prevent the worldwide spread of nuclear weapons, was indefinitely extended in 1995. It was extended with the promise that the CTBT would be ratified by the worlds' nuclear powers. If we defeat this treaty, we will be breaking that promise, and putting our entire world-wide non-proliferation strategy in jeopardy. 
   If we cannot commit to cease testing, we cannot expect other nations to adhere to their commitments on nuclear non-proliferation. When one nation tests nuclear arms, their neighbors get nervous. They are justifiably concerned for their defense and security. The natural response to this threat, for which there is no real defense, is to acquire a threat of ones own.  
   A rejection of this treaty by the U.S. Senate would send a chilling message around the world. The tests by India and Pakistan earlier this year highlight another, more sinister motivation for nuclear tests, the desire to threaten and intimidate. How do we expect nations like India and Pakistan to react to the Senate's rejection of this treaty? 
   For 50 some years we have lived under a gruesome umbrella known as Mutual Assured Destruction. This grim strategic relationship between the Soviet Union and the United States meant that the entire world lived under constant threat of global thermonuclear war. In times of great international tension we were a hair trigger away from unleashing that destruction. If the treaty fails we must contemplate the prospect of dozens of states facing each other in the same insane standoff--in Asia, in the Middle East, in Africa--over disputed borders, scarce resources and ancient hatreds. 
   The opponents of this treaty say we cannot afford the risk that another nation might have the skill and luck required to sneak a couple of nuclear tests under a world-wide monitoring regime. They believe that possibility is a mortal danger to the United States and the advances we have made in over 1,000 nuclear tests. I say we cannot afford the risk of another 50 years of the unfettered development of nuclear weapons around the world. 
   Our stockpile is secure, our deterrent is in place. The United States does not need to test as we have witnessed over the past seven years. 
   We unleashed the nuclear genie that has hung over the world for the last 50 years. But in that moment of leadership, when we signed the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, we took a strong step toward making the world a safer place. Let us today take the next step toward a safer, more secure future.

   Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I want to take a few minutes tonight--Senator GRAHAM of Florida will be joining me, and Senator GORDON SMITH of my home State, my friend and colleague, will be joining me as well tonight--the three of us want to take a few minutes to talk about the important amendment we were able to have added to the HHS appropriations bill during the course of the last week. 
   In the beginning, we especially express our appreciation to Senator SPECTER and Senator HARKIN. They worked with the three of us and our staffs over the last week on this particular issue. 
   What our agricultural labor amendment does is require the Department of Labor to report to the Congress on how the Department plans to promote a legal, domestic workforce--specifically, to improve compensation, working conditions, and other benefits for agricultural workers in the United States. 
   Today's agricultural labor program is a disaster for both farm workers and for farmers. We have a system that is completely broken. Estimates are that well over half of the farm workers in this country are illegal. As a result of their status, they can have no power at all. They can't even vote. They are subjected to the worst possible conditions imaginable, horrendous housing, and, in many instances, thrown into the back of pickup trucks and moved by people called coyotes, who, for a profit, bring them from other countries. The conditions to which our agricultural workers are subjected in so many instances are nothing short of immoral. 
   At the same time, the growers, who have a dependable supply of workers to pick their crops, are also in a completely 
   untenable situation, the growers who want to do the right thing. Senator SMITH and I represent a great many of those growers and farmers in our home State of Oregon, who don't know where to turn to find legal workers. 
   The General Accounting Office did a report a couple of years ago on the farm worker situation in our country. They said there really are enough farm workers, but they came to that conclusion only by counting the illegal farm workers in our country. Well over half of the farm workers in the United States are illegal. It is a situation that essentially turns those farmers, when they want to do the right thing, into people who have to make a choice as to whether or not they want to be felons  and not comply with the law or simply another individual in the bankruptcy line in our country. 
   To give you an idea how absolutely unacceptable this situation is, just this week I had berry farmers from my home State in Oregon telling me they had recently had meetings with the Department of Justice and the Immigration and Naturalization Service. They were told, in effect, how to work the system, but they weren't given any hope that what they were doing was within the law. In effect, the administration was telling the berry farmers in my State, with a wink and a nod, they should tolerate this system that is based on workers who can have no power and farmers who lack a system that is dependable and reliable so they can find legal workers. 
   In the last session of Congress, Senator GRAHAM, Senator SMITH, and I put together a bipartisan proposal to change this wholly unacceptable situation and produce a new system for dealing with agricultural labor that would be in the interest of both the farm worker and the farmer. Under our proposal, workers who were legal would get a significant increase in their benefits. Just how significant was documented in a report done for us by the Library of Congress, October 21, 1998. At page 2 of that report, it states specifically that the Library of Congress found that under our proposal--it received 67 votes in the Senate--the legal farm worker would get significantly higher wages, under what the Senate voted for. In addition, there would be benefits for housing, transportation, a variety of benefits that are so critical to the farm workers. 
   But after 67 Members of the Senate voted for our proposal, the administration said: It is unacceptable. We are going to veto it. It is not good enough. We have other ideas. 
   At that time, Senator SMITH, Senator GRAHAM, and I entered into a series of discussions with the Clinton administration asking them for their plan on how to produce this system that would address the legitimate concerns of both the farm workers and the growers. We have been at that for more than a year. 
   I see our good friend Senator GRAHAM coming to the floor, and I will yield to him in just a moment. 
   Senator GRAHAM, Senator SMITH, and I have been at the task of trying to get from the administration their plan to deal with agricultural labor for more than a year. We told them, if they don't like our proposal--67 votes in the Senate; the Library of Congress said it will produce higher benefits, wages, improved transportation, and improved housing for so many legal workers--since it wasn't good enough for the Clinton administration, we would like to see their proposal. We decided we would, in the spirit of comity and a desire to get an agreement with the executive branch, wait for their proposal. 
   We are still waiting to this day. The administration remains on the sideline to this day, unwilling to come forward with any specific ideas that would be in the interests of both the workers and the growers. Just this week, they told the berry farmers in my home State--and we do a lot of things in Oregon well; frankly, what we do best is grow things; our farmers are very important to our State--the administration basically told them, just wink and nod at the rules that are out there today. 
   In December of 1998, Alexis Herman, Secretary of Labor, sat in a meeting in Senator GRAHAM's office with Senator GRAHAM, Senator SMITH, and myself. Alexis Herman told us, three Members of the Senate, that the administration would give us a specific proposal for dealing with this agricultural labor situation by the end of February 1999. 
   No such proposal has ever been delivered. In a moment, I am going to yield to my friend from Florida because he has essentially laid out a timeline that demonstrates how many times we have tried to get the administration off the sidelines and to join us in a bipartisan effort to produce a system that would work for the farm worker and for the grower. 
   By its inaction, the administration is perpetuating a system that is a disaster for both the farm worker and the farmer. It is a system that is totally broken--a system that has condemned the vast majority of farm workers to some of the most terrible and immoral conditions imaginable. It is a system that has made it impossible for the farmers who want to do the right thing to know where to turn. 
   In the last Congress, Senator GRAHAM, Senator SMITH, and myself brought a legislative proposal that would change that, which the Library of Congress said would produce a significant amount of additional benefits for the legal farm worker. The Clinton administration said that wasn't good enough, and we have waited and waited for their ideas. 
   Well, tonight, as a result of the action taken in the Labor-HHS bill, we are calling, as a matter of law, on the Clinton administration to give us their plan as to how to produce a legal domestic workforce, which would have improved compensation, improved working conditions, and improved benefits that those farm workers are entitled to as a matter of simple justice. 
   So I am hopeful that we will get the administration off the sidelines soon. I am hopeful that they will do what they promised to do well over a year ago. 
   If the Senator from Vermont is willing, I would like to break my remarks off at this point and allow the Senator from Florida to speak for a few minutes. We want to be courteous to our colleague from Vermont because he is dealing with an issue of great importance to him. We will be brief.

   Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Nevada who has been a strong champion of the rights of seniors. He and I serve on the Committee on Aging. 
   I take this opportunity this morning to talk about an extraordinarily important issue for the older people of this country, and that is the need to make sure senior citizens can get prescription drug coverage as part of the Medicare program. 
   I am especially proud that Senator OLYMPIA SNOWE and I have introduced what is now the only bipartisan prescription drug bill before the Senate, and I am hopeful in the days ahead we can get this legislation before the Senate and ensure that the millions of vulnerable older people in this country get decent prescription drug coverage under Medicare. 
   I believe it is time to get this issue out of the beltway, get it out of Washington, DC, and get it to the grassroots of America. That is why Senator SNOWE and I have initiated a grassroots campaign to get prescription drug coverage under Medicare. 
   As folks can see in the example next to me, we are hoping in the next few weeks that senior citizens and their families from across the country will send in copies of their prescription drug bills to their Senators. We think our proposal, the Senior Prescription Insurance Coverage Equity Act, known as SPICE, is the way to proceed because it is bipartisan, it is market oriented, it gives senior citizens choice in the marketplace, and uses marketplace forces to hold down costs for prescription medicine. 
   We use as a model the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program, which is what Members of Congress and their families have as the delivery system for health care. If it is good enough for Members of the Senate, Senator SNOWE and I believe it is good enough for the older people of our country. 
   We are hoping that instead of this just being a discussion within the beltway, with the various interest groups on one side or the other lining up, we hope in the days ahead, as a result of senior citizens sending in copies of their prescription drug bills and their families weighing in with their legislators, we can get our bipartisan bill moving. 
   More than 50 Members of the Senate have already voted for the funding proposal Senator SNOWE and I advocate. We propose there ought to be a tobacco tax to fund this program. We believe that is only right, because in this country, more than $12 billion goes out of the Medicare program each year to handle tobacco-related illnesses. We believe there is a direct connection between the funding proposal we establish and making sure older people get this benefit. With more than 50 Members of the Senate on record for the budget vote that Senator SNOWE and I offered earlier this year, we ought to be able to build on that vote and actually get this program added to Medicare. 
   I am especially pleased the approach Senator SNOWE and I have taken is one that can help lower the cost of prescription drug coverage for older people. A key part of this debate is coverage, but equally as important is the need to hold down the costs of these prescriptions. We are seeing around this country that the big buyers of prescription drugs--the health maintenance organizations and the large purchasers--get a discount and senior citizens are hit with a double whammy. Not only does Medicare not cover their prescriptions, but when a senior citizen walks into a pharmacy and picks up their prescription, say, in Arkansas or Oregon or Maine, they, in effect, are subsidizing the discounts the big buyers are getting as a result of their marketplace power. 
   Some have proposed a system of price controls, putting Medicare in the position of buying up all the medicine and using that as their idea of holding down costs. Senator SNOWE and I think that will end up generating a lot of cost shifting on to the part of other people who are having difficulty covering their prescription drug bills. 
   We favor a market-oriented approach along the lines of the Federal employee health plan. We are not talking about a price control regime or a run-from-the-beltway approach to this issue. We are talking about using marketplace forces to hold down the costs of prescription drugs for our older people. 
   It is especially urgent now. More than 20 percent of the Nation's senior citizens are spending more than $1,000 a year out of pocket for their prescription medicine. We have older people with incomes of $15,000, $16,000 a year spending $1,000 or $1,500 each year on their prescription drugs. Very often those seniors are not able to pick up a prescription their doctor phoned in to their neighborhood pharmacy because the senior citizen cannot afford it, and the prescription languishes for weeks at the pharmacy because they cannot pick it up. 
   That is what I have heard from seniors in my State of Oregon. We have heard from other seniors whose physicians tell them they should be taking three pills a day and they cannot afford that, and they start by taking two, and then they take one. Eventually they get sicker and they need much more expensive care. 
   In fact, the pharmaceuticals now and the medicines of the future are going to be preventive drugs. They are going to be drugs that help lower blood pressure and help us deal with cholesterol problems. As a result, in the long term, we are going to save significant dollars by preventing expensive institutionalizations and hospital services as a result of adding immediate prescription drug coverage to the Medicare program. Clearly, this benefit needs to be paid for. 
   The proposal Senator SNOWE and I have offered will generate more than $70 billion in the next few years to add this benefit to the program. I am very hopeful the Senate will move on a bipartisan basis to tackle this issue.  
   There are many, certainly, in Washington, DC, who think the prescription drug issue is too complicated and too political to deal with now, that we should wait until after the election. Senator SNOWE and I reject that approach. It is more than a year until the next election. We are hoping senior citizens, just as this poster next to me says, will send in copies of their prescription drug bills to their Senators. Tell the Members of the Senate exactly why this issue is important to them, why the lack of prescription drug coverage is causing them a hardship, and help Senator SNOWE and I ignite a grassroots movement to ensure that prescription drug coverage does become part of the Medicare program. 
   In effect, it is time for a wake-up call to the Congress. Some of the naysayers and those who say we ought to put this issue off I think are missing the real needs of the Nation's older people. If you have an income of $15,000 or $16,000 and you are spending $1,500 a year for prescription drugs, if you are giving up other essentials, such as electricity, to pay for your prescription drugs, you cannot afford to wait until after the next election. 
   It may be a luxury for people here in the beltway to wait until after the next election to talk about the need to come up with a practical solution to covering older people with their prescriptions. Senator SNOWE and I think waiting is not a luxury that the millions of vulnerable, older people in this country have. They cannot afford to wait. 
   We are hoping, as a result of this campaign we have launched in the last week to have folks send in a copy of their prescription drug bills, that this can serve as a wakeup call to this Senate and this Congress that the time to act is now. 
   We hope the Senate will choose the proposal we have developed. Undoubtedly, there are other very good ideas. I am sure we will hear from seniors, when they send in copies of their bills, about the best way to address this issue legislatively. Ours is a marketplace-oriented approach. It is based on the kind of program that Members of the Senate have. 
   We hope, in the days ahead, seniors from across the country will send us copies of their prescription drug bills. We want to see this coverage added now. We want to see the Senate address this in a bipartisan way. 
   With that, I yield the floor. 
   Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum and ask unanimous consent the time be evenly charged.

   Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, since we are on the FAA bill this morning, I will take a few minutes to discuss the issue of airline passenger rights. 
   In the face of a wave of consumer complaints which are running at twice the number this time last year, the airline industry has proposed a Customer First program. I will take a few minutes this morning to ensure the Senate understands what this program is all about. After the industry released its voluntary proposal, I asked the General Accounting Office and the Congressional Search Service to analyze what the industry had actually proposed. In summary, these two reports--the one done by the General Accounting Office and the one done by the Congressional Research Service--demonstrates, unfortunately, when it comes to the industry's plan to protect passenger rights, there is no ``There there.'' 
   These two reports found the airline industry's proposal puts passenger rights into three categories: first, rights that passengers already have, as in the rights of the disabled; second, rights that have no teeth in them because they are not written into the contracts of carriage between the passenger and the airline; third, rights that are ignored altogether, such as the right to full information on overbooking and ensuring that passengers can find out about the lowest possible fare. 
   Specifically, I asked the General Accounting Office to compare the voluntary pledges made by the airline industry to the hidden but actually binding contractual rights airline passengers have that are written into something known as a contract of carriage. The Congressional Research Service pointed out:  
   .....front line airline staff seem uncertain as to what contracts of carriage are.  
   The Congressional Research Service found that:  
   ......even if the consumer knows they have a right to the information, they must accurately identify the relevant provisions of the contract of carriage or take home the address or phone number, if available, of the airline's consumer affairs department, send for it and wait for the contract of carriage to arrive in the mail.  
   As the Congressional Research Service states with their unusual tact and diplomacy:  
   ......the airlines do not appear to go out of their way to provide easy access to contract of carriage information.  
   I want the Senate to know the current status of passenger rights so we can begin to strengthen the hand of passengers at a time when we have a record number of consumer complaints. 
   Two weeks ago, the Senate began the task of trying to empower the passengers with the Transportation appropriations bill. In that legislation, we directed the Department of Transportation inspector general to investigate unfair and deceptive practices in the airline industry. The Department of Transportation inspector general does not currently conduct these investigations so we added the mandatory binding consumer protection language in the Transportation appropriations bill to ensure the Transportation inspector general would have exactly the same authority to investigate these consumer protection issues that I proposed in the airline passenger bill of rights early this session. 
   On this FAA bill, I am proposing another step to help passengers. The purpose of the amendment I offer is to make 
   sure customers can find out whether the airlines are actually living up to their voluntary commitments by beginning to write them into the contracts of carriage--the binding agreement between the passenger and the airline. 
   This is what the law division of the Congressional Research Service had to say on that point:  
   It would appear that the voluntary aviation industry standards would probably not have the same level of contractual enforceability that the provisions of the ``contract of carriage'' has. Under basic American contract law, the airlines offer certain terms and service under these ``contracts of carriage'' and the consumer accepts this offer and relies on the terms of the contract when he or she buys a ticket. The voluntary industry standards are not the basis of the contract and may lack the enforceability that the conditions of the ``contract of carriage'' may possess.  
   What especially troubles me is that the airlines are clearly dragging their feet on actually writing these consumer protection provisions in any kind of meaningful fashion. 
   In fact, one of the proposals I saw from American Airlines stipulates specifically that their pledges to the consumer are not enforceable, that they are not going to be in the contracts of carriers. 
   Under my amendment on this FAA bill, the Department of Transportation inspector general is going to investigate whether an airline means what it says, whether it is actually moving to put these various nice-sounding, voluntary proposals into meaningful language. I am very hopeful that as a result of this amendment, we are going to know the truth about actually what kind of consumer protection proposals are in the airline industry's package. 
   This amendment has been shared with the ranking minority member of the committee and the ranking minority member of the subcommittee, and I have talked about it with the chairman of the full committee, Senator MCCAIN. Also, it has been shared with the chairman of the subcommittee. 
   There are many things in this good bill with which I agree. I am especially pleased, with Senator ROCKEFELLER, Senator MCCAIN, and Senator GORTON, we are taking steps to improve competition. I am very pleased, for example, we are doing more for small and medium-size markets. These are very sensible proposals. 
   My concern is that together and on a bipartisan basis, we need to persuade the airline industry to put just a small fraction of the ingenuity and expertise they have that has produced one of the world's truly extraordinary safety records--the airline industry's safety record is extraordinary, and I simply want to see them put the ingenuity and expertise they have into trying to ensure that passengers 
   get a fair shake as well. 
   It is not right at a time like this, particularly when many of the airlines are making such significant profits, to leave airline service for the passengers out on the runway. The figures are indisputable. There are a record number of complaints. I hear constantly from business travelers about the unbelievable problems they have with failure to disclose, for example, overbooking. Many consumers have had problems trying to find out about the lowest fare. 
   With the binding consumer protection language that was adopted in the Transportation appropriations bill so there will be an investigation into the problems I outlined in the airline passenger bill of rights, we have made a start. Today we will have a chance to build on that by making sure these voluntary pledges begin to show up in the contracts of carriage that actually protect the consumer. 
   I express my thanks to Chairman MCCAIN and Senators ROCKEFELLER and GORTON for working with me on these matters and particularly to make sure the Senate knows that in many areas, the areas that promote competition and address the needs of small and medium-size airports--this is an important bill. We can strengthen it with this consumer protection amendment. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to address the Senate for a few minutes. I see Chairman MCCAIN, and I wanted to engage him in a brief discussion on a matter involving the Death on the High Seas Act. I have offered several amendments with respect to this issue, but I don't intend to offer them this morning because this bill has several hundred amendments.

   Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I think it is extraordinarily important that the Senate take steps promptly to remedy some of the loopholes in the antiquated Death on the High Seas Act. I have had constituents bring to my attention a tragedy that is almost unique in my years of working in the consumer protection field. 
   Mr. John Sleavin, one of my constituents, testified before the Commerce Committee that he lost his brother, Mike, his nephew, Ben, and his niece, Annie, under absolutely grotesque circumstances. The family's pleasure boat was run over by a Korean freighter in international waters. The only survivor was the mother, Judith Sleavin, who suffered permanent injuries. The accident was truly extraordinary because, after the collision, there was absolutely no attempt by the Korean vessel to rescue the family or even to notify authorities about the collision. Mr. Sleavin's brother and his niece perished after 8 hours in the water following the collision. It was clear to me that there was an opportunity to have rescued this family. Yet there was no remedy. 
   We have had very compelling testimony on this problem in the Senate Commerce Committee. The chairman has indicated a willingness to work with me on this. We have a Coast Guard bill coming up, and because this is an important consumer protection issue and a contentious one, I don't want to do anything to take a big block of additional time. 
   I will yield at this time for a colloquy with the chairman in the hopes that we can finally get this worked out so we don't have Americans subject to the kind of tragic circumstances we saw in this case, where a family was literally mowed down in international waters by a Korean freighter and should have been rescued and, tragically, loved ones were lost. I feel very strongly about this. 
   I yield now to the chairman of the full committee to hear his thoughts on our ability to get this loophole-ridden Death on the High Seas Act changed, and particularly doing it on the Coast Guard bill that will be coming up.

   Mr. WYDEN. I thank the chairman. I am going to be very brief in wrapping this up. I think our colleagues know that I am not one who goes looking for frivolous litigation. The chairman of the committee and all our colleagues on the Commerce Committee know that I spent a lot of time on the Y2K liability legislation this year so we could resolve these problems without a whole spree of frivolous litigation. 
   But we do know that there are areas, particularly ones where injured consumers in international waters have no remedy at all, when they are subject to some of the most grizzly and unfortunate accidents, where there is a role for legislation and a need for a remedy. 
   I am very appreciative that the chairman has indicated he thinks it is appropriate that we devise a remedy. I intend to work very closely with our colleagues on the Commerce Committee. I know the chairman of the subcommittee, Senator GORTON, has strong views on this. I am willing to look anew with respect to what that remedy ought to be so we can pass a bipartisan bill. But I do think we have to devise a remedy because to have innocent Americans run down in international waters without any remedy can't be acceptable to the American people. 
   With that, I ask unanimous consent to withdraw all four of the amendments I have had filed on this bill with respect to the Death on the High Seas Act.

   Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I do not intend to object. But I have been trying now for almost 2 years on this very important legislation to deal with a very serious problem my constituents have brought to my attention dealing with the loophole-ridden Death On The High Seas Act. 
   We had families at home in Oregon lose loved ones in international waters as a result of a situation where a Korean freighter ran them over. I have been repeatedly assured in the Senate Commerce Committee that we would have an opportunity on the floor of the Senate to remedy this great injustice. In fact, Chairman MCCAIN had agreed with me previously to work to reform the Death On The High Seas Act to ensure that victims of maritime accidents would have the same rights as those provided to victims of aviation accidents under the FAA bill. 
   I have been extremely patient with respect to this matter. I have indicated on at least two occasions that I would not offer the amendment. I do not intend to do it now because the FAA legislation is of such extraordinary importance. But I want to make it clear to the Senate that at the next available opportunity, I am going to do everything I can to ensure that these victims of these maritime tragedies--tragedies in international waters where very often they are run over by foreign freighters and left at sea languishing for hours and hours--actually have a remedy. They do not today. It is a grave injustice. 
   We have discussed this at considerable length in the Senate Commerce Committee. In fact, we even made changes in the Death on the High Seas Act in the past without addressing this particular issue. 
   I do not intend to hold up the consideration of the FAA legislation because it is so important, but I want to make it very clear to the Senate that at the next available opportunity, we are going to debate this on the floor of the Senate. We are going to have an up-or-down vote on it. My colleagues are now aware of that. 
   Mr. President, I withdraw my reservation. 
   Several Senators addressed the Chair.

    Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I am pleased to be joined by Senators LEAHY and BAUCUS to introduce today a resolution calling for an international ban on tariffs and on special, multiple and discriminatory taxes on electronic commerce and the Internet. Representative COX, with whom I have collaborated in the past on Internet-related matters, is introducing a companion resolution in the House of Representatives. 
   The resolution urges the President to seek a global consensus supporting a permanent international moratorium on tariffs on electronic commerce, and an international ban on special, multiple, and discriminatory taxation of electronic commerce and the Internet. The resolution urges the President to pursue the ban on tariffs through the World Trade Organization--particularly at the WTO Ministerial meeting that will be held in Seattle this November, and to pursue the moratorium on discriminatory, special, and multiple taxes on global e-commerce through the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. These positions reinforce the efforts of the U.S. Trade Representative at the WTO and of the U.S. negotiators at the OECD. 
   In the Internet Tax Freedom Act, enacted during the last Congress, we challenged the concept of 30,000 U.S. tax jurisdictions swamping online consumers and entrepreneurs with a crazy quilt of discriminatory taxes. But this problem is small potatoes compared to the prospect of thousands of additional discriminatory tax regimes Americans might face in nearly 200 countries around the world. 
   We are not going to sit by while the booming, global e-market becomes a  tasty feast for overly hungry tax collectors from Bonn to Beijing and Manila to Milan. 
   The same questions we dealt with in the United States become vastly more complex at the international level. For example, during the course of the debate about the Internet Tax Freedom Act last year, I asked what happens when Aunt Millie in Iowa uses America Online in Virginia to order Harry and David's pears from Medford, Oregon, pays for them with a bankcard in California and ships them to her old friend in Florida? 
   In the global arena, we have to ask what happens when a tax collector in Germany tries to collect a Value Added Tax on a U.S. e-entrepreneur from Coos Bay, Oregon with no physical presence in Europe? This is a very real threat because not long ago, the tax chief of a key European nation called trade over the Internet ``a threat to all government tax revenue--a very serious threat.'' 
   In addition, we have heard about the possibility of discriminatory bit taxes, which are taxes levied on the volume of e-mail that passes over the Net. And we have recently learned that the European Union is discussing something known as ``blocking and takedown.'' This is not a rugby term, but if established, it would allow the EU to bar the use of an American entrepreneur's website in Europe if he or she was unwilling to participate in an EU tax registration scheme. 
   Moreover, some countries are blurring the line between services and products in an effort to impose still more special, targeted tariffs and taxes on global e-commerce. At present, some digital delivery--for example, downloading a CD or software program--is not taxed, but there's considerable support for turning this service into a product that could be the subject of discriminatory taxes. 
   Developing fair ground rules for the global digital economy is not a job for the faint hearted. That is why strong U.S. leadership is imperative in key multinational groups that are beginning to consider how to update old laws and regulations to apply in the global electronic marketplace. 
   That is the point of the resolution we are introducing today. Again, the resolution does two things: it urges the President to seek a global consensus supporting a global moratorium on tariffs on electronic commerce at the upcoming WTO ministerial meeting in Seattle, and second, it urges the President to seek through the OECD a global moratorium on discriminatory, multiple and special taxes on electronic commerce and the Internet. 
   This resolution builds upon the good work we accomplished in the 1998 Internet Tax Freedom Act. It is time to take the effort to stop discriminatory taxes on electronic commerce to the international level. I urge my colleagues to join us in supporting the resolution.

   Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, it has been a pleasure to listen to my colleague from Maine. I think she has said it superbly. It has been a pleasure to be working with her over the last few months. The reality is that nothing important in the Congress gets done unless it is bipartisan. It is just that simple. 
   What Senator SNOWE and I have said repeatedly is that we want to get beyond some of the squabbling that goes on in Washington, DC, and really come together as a Congress, across the political aisle, and get prescription drug coverage added to the Medicare program. 
   I think it is especially important now to hear from the Nation's senior citizens. For the last few months, we have been hearing from all of these beltway experts. Some of them, as Senator SNOWE mentioned, have actually said seniors don't need these benefits. They say, well, this isn't a very serious problem, in spite of the fact that we have more than 20 percent of the Nation's elderly spending $1,000 a year out of pocket on their prescription medicine. We have some of these self-styled experts in Washington, DC, going to conferences and programs and saying seniors really don't need this coverage. 
   So what we want to do is take this debate about prescription drug coverage and the need to assist seniors out of the beltway, get it out beyond Washington, DC, and start hearing from seniors and their families. 
   Maybe some of these experts have good coverage and that is why they don't think it is important to cover the needs of seniors. Maybe they are not talking to their parents. But I can tell you, the seniors who come out to town meetings in Maine and Oregon are saying they can't afford prescription medicine and, very often, they will leave an order that has been phoned in by their physician at a pharmacy because they can't afford to pick it up. They are told to take three pills as part of their program to recover, but they start off taking two; they can't afford that; and then they take one; and eventually they get much sicker and end up needing much more expensive care. 
   So we want to make sure in the days ahead, in our effort to pass a bipartisan prescription drug bill, that the Senate and the Congress hear from the Nation's older people. We would like to say today that we hope senior citizens and their families across this country who want to see the Congress pass a bipartisan bill to add prescription drug coverage--we hope those seniors and their families, just as this chart next to me indicates, will send copies of their bills to their Senator and their Member of Congress. 
   Right next to me is a chart showing how simple it is for seniors and their families to make sure their voices aren't drowned out by some of these experts saying we don't need prescription drug coverage as part of Medicare. Just as this chart shows, a simple note to a Member of Congress, a Member of this body, can help us forge a bipartisan coalition and actually get this done. We hope when we hear from seniors and their families, they will support the SPICE legislation. But what is really important is that the Congress hear from those older people and their families. 
   We think ours is a good bill. For example, under our legislation, seniors will have the bargaining power and the clout in the marketplace the way the big health maintenance organizations have, so we can keep the costs of prescription drugs down. 
   A lot of our colleagues, both in the Senate and in the House, are touting studies about how seniors spend a lot more when they walk into a pharmacy for their prescription drugs than would a big buyer such as a health maintenance organization. That is true. Seniors get hit by a double whammy: They can't afford prescription drug coverage. Yet when they walk into a pharmacy, they subsidize those big buyers, the purchasers through a health maintenance organization who get a discount. 
   Well, Senator SNOWE and I think that if a health plan is good enough for Members of Congress and their families and that health plan uses marketplace forces to hold costs down, let's use a model such as that to serve the needs of older people. We are not reinventing the wheel. We are not having the Federal Government take over health care. We are using a system that Members of Congress and their families know well, a system that ensures that seniors will be in a position to hold down the costs of their medicine as well as be able to obtain coverage. 
   I am very pleased to have a chance to work with Senator SNOWE and to spend a few minutes discussing issues with her. I think the big challenge is to get this issue out of the beltway and to work in a bipartisan fashion. Senator SNOWE and I have been trying to do that in the Budget Committee. There are some who want to make this a political issue for the 2000 campaign. We are not naive. We recognize that. 
   Certainly if there were no good ideas to tackle this problem, it would be an issue that would come up in the campaign. However, Senator SNOWE and I think because more than half of the Senate has already voted for the funding plan that we propose, because we are relying on a model we know works for Members of Congress and their families, we shouldn't wait another 2 years for another election to act. We think the time to act is now. 
   I will address my colleague by way of saying, Senator, what strikes me as missing is the voice of seniors and their families. We have heard from all the experts in Washington, DC. What has been missing is the voices of seniors and their families. I want them to start sending in their bills and telling Members what they think about the crushing costs of prescription medicine. 
   Perhaps the Senator could comment.

   Mr. WYDEN. We know new prescriptions are right on the forefront of preventive medicine. What is exciting about the new medicines is they help 
   to lower blood pressure and they can be helpful in dealing with a wide variety of health concerns, including cholesterol and other problems seniors have. 
   Could the Senator tell Members a little bit about how the model SPICE benefit was devised? It seems to me the Senator is trying to focus on wellness, holding costs down, and making prescriptions affordable.

   Mr. WYDEN. I appreciate my colleague's question. We use marketplace forces. We use a dose of free enterprise, how our Federal employee health plan works. 
   What troubles me is a lot of those other bills focus on an approach of Government purchasing the medicine, but that will shift the costs onto a lot of other people. 
   I am very fearful that under some of those approaches, particularly the ones in the House, because Medicare essentially would control prices, they will shift the costs. What will happen is an African American woman who is 27, maybe single with a couple of children, will end up with a higher prescription drug bill because that person will end up seeing the costs shifted when prices are controlled just for the Medicare Program. 
   I think we ought to use marketplace forces, competitive principles. That is what our legislation does. It will prevent cost shifting and help to hold down costs for all Americans. 
   I yield the floor.

    Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I wish to recognize the outstanding work of the VIEWS volunteers at Mt. Hood Community Mental Health Center of Gresham, Oregon. They devote many hours to helping seniors in emotional crisis. 
   Mt. Hood Community Mental Health Center began in 1985 as an outreach program for seniors at risk of suicide, and soon developed several programs to address various levels of depression or emotional crisis among seniors, including Volunteers Involved in the Emotional Well-being of Seniors (VIEWS). Over the last ten years, Mt. Hood Community Mental Health Center has trained more than 100 peer counselors who have, in turn, provided crucial counseling to over 400 seniors. Without the help of these volunteers, many of Oregon's seniors would have sunk deeper into isolation and despair. As a result of the assistance of these invaluable volunteers, the medical professionals at Mt. Hood Community Mental Health Center have been able to extend their reach far beyond what their limited budget would otherwise allow. 
   These volunteers are performing extraordinary work. I am proud that my own State of Oregon has initiated this effort, and I again wish to congratulate the VIEWS volunteers for being an example of what we can do to help others make a positive difference in the lives of seniors.

   Mr. WYDEN. I will be very brief. I, too, appreciate Senators MIKULSKI and BOND supporting this. I think the point Senator KERRY is making with this amendment--I hope in the days ahead it yields to a broader debate--is that at a time of record economic prosperity, we are having extraordinary crises in terms of access to affordable housing. All across this country we have waiting lists, sometimes for years, for the kind of people that Senator KERRY is trying to assist with this amendment. I think this is a start. Senator MIKULSKI and Senator BOND have been very gracious to accept this amendment. I commend them for it. But I hope in the days ahead that we can build on the Kerry amendment and really drive these waiting lists down. 
   If anything, the hot economy we are seeing is driving up rents and, in effect, contributing to the problems we are having with these waiting lists. 
   I didn't want to take a lot of time of the Senate, and I am very pleased Senator KERRY is leading this effort. I hope this is seen as the beginning of a bipartisan effort to drive down these waiting lists that are years and years in some communities for disabled folks, seniors, and those with HIV. 
   I thank the Senator from Massachusetts for yielding time. I am glad this amendment has been accepted on both sides of the aisle.

    Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, it is time for Congress to enact a new program that combines secure funding for county services with a fresh approach to the management of federal lands in rural communities. Under our legislation counties will be connected to federal lands not just through the cutting of timber but also through important  road maintenance projects, watershed improvements and programs that promote tourism and recreation. 
   Since 1908, natural resource dependent communities have received federal funds for schools, roads and basic services based on the level of federal timber programs. The Forest Service cuts timber and the counties receive revenue. This has long constituted the traditional relationship between the counties and federal land management. 
   Now, as a result of changes in natural resource policies causing declines in timber production, many of our rural communities are finding it almost impossible to fund essential programs for school children, infrastructure and other needs. 
   There is a crisis in rural, timber-dependent America that must be addressed now. This crisis can be addressed now and in the future by providing secure, consistent funding to counties, and by encouraging a new cooperative relationship between these communities and federal land managers. 
   Congress must promptly enact a new program that combines traditional funding for county services with creative new policies that provide real connections between rural communities and the federal lands they cherish. 
   Senator CRAIG and I have been discussing how this might be accomplished because we realize that no pending proposal addressing the county payment issue has won the support of both the Congress and the Clinton administration. 
   In an effort to break this gridlock, we have developed the Secure Rural Schools and Community Self-Determination Act bill.

   Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President and colleagues, these two amendments are essential to begin to ensure that passengers in this country get a fair shake with respect to airline service. 
   We have seen in recent months that the airline industry is going to great lengths with their so-called customer service pledge to try, through a series of voluntary promises, to show to the American people that they are really committed to improving airline service. 
   The fact is, Mr. President and colleagues, two studies that have just come out demonstrate that these voluntary promises by the airline industry really are not worth much more than the paper on which they are written. So I am very pleased to come to the floor of the Senate today with my good friend, the chairman of the subcommittee, Senator SHELBY, and the ranking minority member, Senator LAUTENBERG, to make it very clear that in two key areas--overbooking and making sure that passengers can be informed of the lowest fare available--the inspector general will be directed to investigate promptly when in fact consumers are ripped off in those areas. 
   Let me touch specifically on both of those provisions. 
   The first deals with the overbooking issue. In addition to my friend from Alabama, the chairman of the subcommittee, I am very pleased Senator CAMPBELL has joined us in this effort, as well as Senator FEINGOLD from this side of the aisle. It is truly bipartisan. 
   The reason it is needed is that if this morning you call an airline and inquire about purchasing a ticket on a flight and they are overbooked, that airline does not have to tell you they are overbooked before they take your money. 
   We do not think that is right. We think the public has the right to know. Certainly the airline ought to be in a position to sell you a ticket even if they are overbooked, but it ought to be the consumer's right to have that information before they actually put their money down. 
   So the first proposal we are offering today makes sure that consumers will be informed in these instances of overbooking. 
   The second amendment we are offering deals with making sure that passengers can be adequately informed of the lowest fare available on flights. Finding the lowest airfare is one of the great mysteries of Western life. Today on any given flight, there may be as many different fares as there are passengers on the plane. So with respect to this matter of making sure the passengers can be informed of the lowest fare available, I offer a second amendment, again with the chairman of the subcommittee, Mr. SHELBY, and the ranking minority member, Senator LAUTENBERG, to make sure that passengers will be in a position to be informed of the lowest fares. 
   Some airlines right now are giving customers with computers a price break just because they have a computer to access the web site. We have all heard about the digital divide. In fact, some folks have the technology; others do not. The current situation penalizes the technology have-nots; they have to pay a higher fare. Of course, when the airlines have you, the customer, on the phone, they have in fact ``got you.'' You may not own a computer or have access to one. You have to pay whatever price the airline quotes you. 
   No matter how a customer contacts an airline--at the ticket counter, over the phone, or through the airline's web site--it is the view of the sponsors of this amendment--myself, the distinguished chairman of the subcommittee, Mr. SHELBY, and the distinguished ranking minority member, Senator LAUTENBERG--that the consumer ought to be informed. 
   Right now, on a voluntary pledge that has been made by the airline industry, there is a lot of high-sounding rhetoric in telling customers about the lowest fare, but the harsh reality is it is essentially business as usual. 
   In fact, I think it is worth noting the language in the pledge, as it stands today, to offer the lowest fare available. What the pledge by the airline industry stipulates today is: If a consumer uses the phone to call an airline and asks about a specific flight on a specific day in a specific class, the airline will tell you the lowest fare. That is something that they are already required to do by current regulation. 
   Not only will they not provide you relevant information about lower fares on other flights on the same airline, they will not even tell you about lower fares that are probably on their web page. 
   For example, a Delta agent recently quoted a consumer over the phone a round trip fare to Portland--my hometown--of $400. Five minutes later, the consumer found a price for $218 for the exact flight on Delta's web page. 
   I do want to leave time for other colleagues to be able to speak on these amendments. Both of the amendments, it seems to me, hit critical issues with respect to disclosure to airline passengers of information that they need to make their travel choices. 
   We are not calling for a constitutional right to a fluffy pillow on an airline flight or a jumbo bag of peanuts. We are saying the public has the right to know. 
   We had 100,000 people bumped last year, and we are finding, in the first 6 months of this year, consumer complaints are growing at an unprecedented level with respect to airline service. 
   Unfortunately, this voluntary pledge by the airline industry is essentially toothless. They give you three kinds of rights: First, a set of rights that you already have, and that deals with the disabled; second, rights that they are reluctant to actually write into the legalese that constitute the real contract between the consumer and the airline--these are known as contracts of carriage; and, finally, the consumers' rights that are ignored altogether. 
   The Wyden-Shelby-Lautenberg amendments we will be voting on at 11 o'clock ensure that those rights which are being ignored altogether would be protected, that in the future consumers will be informed when a flight is overbooked. Consumers would be in a position to learn the lowest fare available, and if that is not the case, under this amendment the Department of Transportation is directed to go on out and investigate that as a deceptive trade practice, and the consumer is protected. 
   So I will reserve the remainder of my time. We may have other colleagues who want to speak. But again, I express my appreciation to the chairman of the subcommittee, Senator SHELBY. He and Senator LAUTENBERG have worked very closely with us on this amendment. 
   I reserve the remainder of my time and yield the floor. 
   Mr. SHELBY addressed the Chair.

   Mr. WYDEN. Thank you. 
   Mr. President, first, in the package of amendments with respect to overbooking and making sure the passenger has the lowest fare available, that has nothing to do with seat size. I think all of our colleagues know it. 
   The reason the Consumer Federation of America and Consumers Union put on the floor for each Member of this body a strong endorsement letter for these two amendments this morning is that they think the public has a right to know this basic information. That is all these two amendments are about. 
   The fact is that my good friend from West Virginia has a difference of opinion with respect to the airline industry voluntary pledges. 
   I agree with the General Accounting Office and the Congressional Research Service. They came out with reports this week that essentially showed that with respect to these voluntary industry pledges, there is no ``there'' there. These voluntary industry pledges either involve rights that the consumer already has, No. 1, rights that the airline industry is unwilling to write into the contract between the airline and the consumer, known as contracts of carriage, or rights that are essentially ignored altogether, which are overbooking. 
   Nobody is talking about micromanagement or a constitutional right to fluffy pillows. We are talking about basic information for the public. 
   What has happened since the voluntary industry agreement of earlier this summer is, two congressional reports have come out--a report by the Congressional Research Service and a report by the General Accounting Office. Let me read from a portion of what the General Accounting Office has said. The General Accounting Office said with respect to the key measures in the voluntary package--ensuring customer service from an airline, cosharing partners, a refund provision, a special needs provision--these are already required. 
   The airline industry has tried, with a lot of hocus-pocus with the voluntary pledges, to convince the Congress and the American people that they really are responding substantively when in fact this is essentially old wine in new bottles. 
   That is why this morning the Consumers Union and the Consumer Federation have put on to the desks of each Member of this body a strong endorsement letter. This is about the public's right to know, the public's right to disclosure of information in two areas: The lowest fare; second, with respect to overbooking. That is what this issue is about. 
   Members can either be with the passengers or Members can be with the airline industry, which the General Accounting Office and the Congressional Research Service said this week has offered voluntary pledges that are woefully deficient because they essentially do nothing other than restate current law. 
   I yield the floor, and I reserve the remainder of my time.

   Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I don't see any other speakers. I will be very brief in wrapping up. 
   Again with respect to these voluntary pledges that have been made by the airline industry, I think it is worth noting exactly what the General Accounting Office said about this so-called customer service first program. 
   The General Accounting Office found that of the 16 pledges the airline industry made in their voluntary customer first package, 3 of them are already required by Federal law, 4 of them are already required by what are known as the contracts of carriage, legal contracts, and the vast majority of them aren't written in at all. They are not written in any way with respect to key areas such as making sure consumers are adequately informed about the lowest fares, making sure customers are informed about delays, cancellations, and diversions, returning checked bags within 24 hours, credit card refunds, informing passengers about restrictions on frequent flier rules, and having customer service representatives to actually help the public. 
   That is what the General Accounting Office said. 
   I am very hopeful we will see some of the airlines individually go beyond what is being proposed in their voluntary package. 
   In reading the General Accounting Office and the Congressional Research Service reports that have come out since this voluntary agreement was entered into, anyone will see how woefully inadequate the consumer protections are for the public in this country. In fact, these contracts of carriage, which are legalese and technical lingo that spells out the contract between the consumer and the airline, the Congressional Research Service found most of the front-line airline staff didn't even know what these contracts of carriage were. The consumer would basically have to do somersaults to try to get information about them. 
   It is largely not available, even at the ticket counter in many instances. It shows again how reluctant these airlines are, in the vast majority of instances, to truly inform the public. 
   At the end of the day, passengers have three types of rights: Rights in effect they already have; rights that will not be spelled out in the contract; and, finally, rights that are being ignored altogether. That is why the Consumers Union today is urging the Senate to adopt these two amendments. They are on the side of the passengers. They understand the voluntary pledges that have been made by the airline industry lack teeth. They are gobbledegook. 
   I urge my colleagues to strongly support these two amendments, agree with the Consumers Union rather than with the airline industry, and let's ensure that at a time when complaints are at a record level, which is the situation we find ourselves in today, we are making sure the passengers can get a fair shake when it comes to learning about the lowest fare available and learning about their rights when there has been an overbooking. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. WYDEN. I thank the Chair. I would like to take just a few minutes now to speak on behalf of the Bryan-Fitzgerald-Wyden amendment and try to offer up to colleagues on both sides of the aisle why Senator BRYAN, Senator FITZGERALD, and I are trying to incorporate some of the important thinking that has been done by the chairman of the Interior Subcommittee, Senator GORTON, as well as the work with respect to forestry done on the floor of the Senate over the last few days by Senator ROBB of Virginia. It seems to me that Senator GORTON, as well as Senator ROBB, are making extremely important points. What Senator BRYAN, Senator FITZGERALD, and I are trying to do is build on the work done by both of our colleagues. 
   For example, I think Senator GORTON and Senator CRAIG are absolutely right in terms of saying that the Forest Service has lacked direction, particularly as it relates to the Pacific Northwest. They have known at the Forest Service for many months that they had to comply with each of these survey and management requirements. The Forest Service dawdled and dragged its feet. It has been literally flailing around in the woods. 
   I think Senator GORTON and Senator CRAIG have been absolutely right that there has been a lack of accountability and a lack of oversight with respect to the Forest Service. 
   At the same time, I think Senator ROBB has also been correct in terms of saying we can't just throw the environmental laws in the trash can because a Federal agency messes up. You can't just set aside the environmental laws of the United States because a Federal agency, in this case the Forest Service, has not done its job. You have to figure out a way to put this agency and this program back on track. 
   What the Bryan-Fitzgerald-Wyden amendment seeks to do is to get the Forest Service on track by building on some of the important work done by Senator GORTON and Senator CRAIG, as well as focusing on the environmental principles pursued by Senator ROBB. 
   One of the reasons I so strongly support the Bryan-Fitzgerald-Wyden amendment is we have seen in past years that throwing money at the timber sale program does not make things better. Each year, since 1996, this Congress has authorized more money for the timber sale program than the administration has asked for. So we have, in effect, shoveled more money out the door for the timber sale program. 
   The fact of the matter is, in spite of the fact the Congress keeps spending more money on the timber sale program, the problems in these rural communities, particularly the rural West --and these are economic and environmental problems--keep getting worse. So the notion that throwing money at the timber sale program is going to solve these problems is simply not correct. The Congress has continued to spend money. The problems are getting worse, both from an economic and an environmental standpoint. And that is the bottom line. 
   So what Senator BRYAN and Senator FITZGERALD and I are seeking to do is to link the money that the Forest Service needs for these important programs--not just in Oregon but across the country--to a new focus on accountability. 
   What our legislation does is earmark resources for the important environmental work that needs to be done and at the same time places a stringent timetable on the completion of the important environmental work. So, in effect, we have a chance to do some good by getting the environmental work done while at the same time helping timber workers and environmental concerns addressed in a responsible fashion. 
   We do direct additional funds for the survey and management program so we can have the protocols for the species that currently lack this data, but we do it in a way that brings new accountability. This is the first time on the floor of the Senate that we have tried to take this program, which has been so mismanaged by the Forest Service, and put in place some real accountability. 
   This is not the old days of just throwing money at problems. This is a new approach, a fresh and creative approach, that Senators BRYAN, FITZGERALD, and I are trying to offer which will ensure that not just in the Northwest but across the country there will be the funds that are needed for the timber sale program, but at the same time we are going to have a real process to watchdog the Forest Service to make sure they actually get the work done. 
   With respect to the problems that have shut down the forests in the Pacific Northwest, our amendment requires that 
   the survey and management draft, the environmental impact statement would be completed by November 15 of this year. The final version of that impact statement would be published by February 14 of 2000. 
   So this gives us a chance, I say to my colleagues, to make sure the work that was promised actually gets done. We fund the timber sale program at the levels called for by the administration. We have a chance to learn from years past that just throwing money at the timber sale program does not solve things. 
   I hope our colleagues will realize that this bipartisan approach is a chance to solve problems, which is vitally important to rural communities not just in the West but across the country, while at the same time honoring the important environmental obligations this Congress has set out for the Forest Service and other agencies. 
   I do hope that however colleagues voted on the Robb amendment, whatever they think with respect to the original language proposed by Senator GORTON, they will look anew at the Bryan-Fitzgerald-Wyden amendment because what we are seeking to do is build on the important principles embodied behind both of those positions. 
   My two colleagues are here from the Northwest, the distinguished chairman of the subcommittee, Senator GORTON, and the chairman of the committee on which I serve, Senator CRAIG. They are absolutely right; the Forest Service has lacked direction. Under the Bryan-Fitzgerald-Wyden amendment, we put in place that direction and real accountability. 
   For those who voted for the Robb amendment earlier, and want to make sure environmental laws are respected and honored, we keep in place the notion that you do not throw those laws into the garbage can on appropriations bills. 
   So I am hopeful my colleagues will support this on a bipartisan basis. I particularly thank the original sponsor of the legislation, Senator BRYAN. He has done yeoman work to try to put in place a bipartisan coalition. I hope this proposal will be attractive to my colleagues of both political parties. 
   Mr. President, with that I yield the floor.

   Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, let me wrap up by saying that colleagues can see, year after year, this Congress has increased funding for the timber sale program. You can see that pattern since the late 1990s, going into this year. So all Senator BRYAN, Senator FITZGERALD, and I are trying to say is that there is more to this question, practicing sustainable forestry that will be good for rural communities as relates to their economic needs and to their environmental needs--there is more to this than just throwing money at the timber sale program. 
   If throwing money at the timber sale program was going to make things better, all of us in this body would have seen improvements over the last few years. In fact, we have seen the problems get worse. The problems have worsened in so many of these rural communities in both economics and the environment. 
   Much has been made of comments in our newspaper, the Oregonian, because of the importance of the forest in the Pacific Northwest. The Oregonian, in their editorial pages, said:  
   What is needed is a carefully negotiated agreement on appropriate surveys for rare species and adequate funding to do them.  
   That is exactly what the Bryan-Fitzgerald-Wyden package does. For the first time we link adequate funding for the timber sale program to specific requirements for accountability and oversight. Never before on the floor of the Senate have we 
   made the judgment that is in the Bryan-Fitzgerald-Wyden package that in fact the Forest Service really has lost direction in complying with a lot of these environmental concerns. 
   But we do not throw the environmental laws in the garbage can. Instead, we have the important effort that was launched by Senator ROBB and our good friend, Senator CLELAND, who is here this morning. At the same time, we agree with Senators CRAIG and GORTON that we do need to put this program on track. 
   So I am very hopeful my colleagues on both sides of the aisle will see this as a practical approach, an approach that is sensitive to the economic needs of rural communities, an approach that complies with the Nation's environmental laws and at the same time allows us to be a more effective steward of resources for taxpayers in this country. 
   This is not the end of the debate. Certainly what the Oregonian called for recently--a negotiated agreement on surveys to comply with the environmental rules and adequate funding--is going to have to be fleshed out when the House and Senate go to a conference committee. But this is the first step to a fresh approach that links adequate funding for the necessary environmental work with accountability that is long overdue at the Forest Service and a chance to meet the economic needs of the rural communities. 
   If all that was needed was what some of my colleagues on the other side have called for, which is spending more money on the timber sale program--we would not have many of the problems we are seeing today because year after year this Congress has put more money in the timber sale program. What we need is what Senators BRYAN and FITZGERALD and I have talked about on this floor, an effort to link the new focus on accountability at the Forest Service with compliance with environmental rules and sensitivity to economic concerns. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan amendment, and I yield the floor.

   Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, first I express my thanks to the bipartisan leadership of the committee, Chairman SHELBY, who has been extraordinarily helpful on this matter, which is a critical issue of protecting the rights of airline passengers in this country, and I also thank my longtime friend, Senator LAUTENBERG, who has spent a great deal of time with me on this issue over the last few months. The bipartisan leadership of this committee stands out in the Congress in terms of trying to ensure that airline passengers get a fair shake. It is high time, Mr. President, and colleagues. 
   Last year, we saw an unprecedented increase in the number of complaints by airline passengers about shoddy service. In the first 6 months of this year, we have seen another unprecedented increase in complaints by passengers of airline service. 
   This is the first of two amendments I intend to offer with the chairman of the subcommittee, Mr. SHELBY, and the ranking minority member, Mr. LAUTENBERG, to try to balance the scales and ensure that the passengers get a fair shake and, in particular, get information about key services, such as the lowest fare, and accurately be told when a flight is overbooked. 
   I emphasize to my colleagues that I am not proposing the Congress establish a constitutional right to a fluffy pillow on an airplane flight or a jumbo bag of peanuts. But I think airline passengers have a right to timely and accurate information. 
   The purchase of an airline ticket today in America is like virtually no movie choice. Unlike movie theaters that sell tickets to a movie or a store that sells soccer balls, the airline industry provides no real assurance that they will be able to use the product as intended. They have made a variety of voluntary pledges to try to turn around this situation. But what we have seen in the last few days as a result of a study by the GAO and a study by the Congressional Research Service is that these voluntary pledges by the airline industry aren't worth much more than the paper they are written on. 
   I am very pleased to offer this first amendment to try to ensure that passengers can be informed when an airline is overbooked. 
   Again, I thank the bipartisan leadership of the committee. In addition to Senators SHELBY and LAUTENBERG, Senators CAMPBELL and FEINGOLD have also been supportive in finally holding these airlines accountable with respect to making sure passengers are informed when a flight is overbooked. That is the problem today in America with overbooking. If you call an airline right now and they are overbooked, they won't tell you that before they sell you a ticket. The public has a right to know. The passengers have a right to know. These voluntary pledges aren't going to do it. 
   For example, the voluntary pledge the airline industry has made on overbooking is, and I quote:  
   They will disclose to passengers upon request whether the flight on which the passenger is ticketed is overbooked if within the usual and ordinary scope of such employee's work, the information is available to the airline employee to whom the request is made.  In plain English, that means if you are lucky and happen to ask the right employee, you may get a straight answer on overbooking.  
   This bipartisan amendment says the Department of Transportation inspector general can and should investigate as a deceptive trade practice the failure to inform the consumer when a flight is overbooked. In 1997, the Department of Transportation reported the airlines bumped more than 1 million passengers. Since that time, more than 100,000 passengers have been bumped involuntarily. This means more than 100,000 passengers are paying for seats they never sat in. 
   I think it is time to make sure the public's right to know is protected. This first bipartisan amendment gives Members that opportunity. 
   My thanks to my senior colleague, the chairman, and the ranking minority member. I urge the Senate to adopt this amendment. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, this amendment I also offer with the bipartisan leadership of the subcommittee, Chairman SHELBY and Senator LAUTENBERG. Again, I express my thanks to both of them. As you could tell from Senator LAUTENBERG's excellent statement, he has strong views on this matter. They go back a long time. 
   One of the areas I most admire about Senator LAUTENBERG has been his extraordinary work on tobacco control. The fact of the matter is, Senator LAUTENBERG for years led that effort to make air flights healthier in our country. That is just one of the many contributions he has made in public service. We thank him for it. 
   This amendment as well is supported by the chairman of the subcommittee, Chairman SHELBY, and the ranking minority member, Senator LAUTENBERG. As I have sought to do with respect to overbooking, again this amendment would ensure there were teeth behind this so-called pledge by the airlines to make information about the lowest possible fare available to the consumer. Finding the lowest air fare in America is now one of the great mysteries of Western life. 
   On any given flight there may be as many different fares as there are passengers on the plane. One of the things that experts in aviation have said for some time is if you want to start a brawl on an air flight, ask the passengers to compare notes with respect to how much they paid for a ticket because there will be remarkable differences, even among people who made the same sort of arrangements to fly. 
   The purpose of this bipartisan amendment is to make sure, no matter  how a customer contacts an airline--at the ticket counter, over the telephone, or at an airline's web site--the customer would get the same information about the lowest fare. Again, the airlines in these voluntary pledges that they have made have a lot of lofty rhetoric about telling the consumer about the lowest fare, but the harsh reality is that it is business as usual. This amendment would hold the airlines accountable to their pledge to actually make available to the consumer, in an understandable way, information about the lowest fare available. 
   The pledge to offer the lowest fare available as it stands now, in the voluntary package from the airline industry, is, again, sort of more hocus-pocus, as far as the consumer is concerned. In effect, what the airlines are now saying is that if a consumer uses the phone to call an airline and asks about a specific flight on a specific date in a specific class, the airline will tell the consumer the lowest fare, as they are already required to do by law. Not only will the airlines not provide the consumer relevant information about lower fares on other flights on the same airline, they will not even tell the consumer about lower fares that are probably on the airline's web page--and for obvious reasons. Once they have you on the phone and they can get you at a higher price, they might not be so interested in letting you know about something else that is available on the web page. 
   Recently a Delta agent quoted a consumer over the telephone a round trip fare to Portland, my hometown, of $400, and 5 minutes later the consumer found a price of $218 for the exact same flight on Delta's web page. 
   What this amendment stipulates, again, as with the bipartisan effort with respect to overbooking, is that the passenger has a right to know. The public has a right to know. We are not 
   setting up any new Government agencies. We are not calling for some micromanaged, run-from-Washington kind of operation. We are saying the passenger deserves a fair shake with respect to accurate information on the lowest fares that are available. 
   So this amendment, that I am proud to offer again with the chairman of the subcommittee, Chairman SHELBY, and Senator LAUTENBERG, would stipulate the Department of Transportation could investigate as a deceptive trade practice the failure on the part of an airline to tell the passenger the lowest fare that is available, no matter how the customer contacts the airline. Under the voluntary pledge, again, the airlines are going to be in a position to withhold information about the lowest fares from customers, information that they have, as Senator LAUTENBERG noted in his previous statement, and information that ought to be supplied to the consumer so the consumer can make accurate choices. 
   All we are talking about in both of these amendments is access to information, full disclosure, the public's right to know. But the failure to do it, the failure to inform the consumer, ought to be treated seriously by this Congress. 
   These two amendments provide that opportunity to do so by saying the Department of Transportation can investigate as a deceptive trade practice the failure to inform the public, in this case of the lowest fare available, in the previous case information about overbooking. 
   I know time is short and there is much to do with respect to this important legislation. I thank Senator SHELBY and Senator LAUTENBERG for their support. I yield the floor.

   Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I want to commend the distinguished Senator from West Virginia for an excellent statement with respect to the air traffic control system. It seems to me what the Senator from West Virginia has pointed out is that our country, to some extent, wants a 21st century air traffic control system and they want to figure out how to do it on a 19th century budget. 
   The Senator from West Virginia, it seems to me, is saying it is time for all of us in the Congress to, in effect, put our dollars where our mouth is with respect to safety. If you are serious about improving safety, you have to fund this woefully inadequate air traffic control system. 
   The fact of the matter is, the Senator from West Virginia has spent many years battling to strengthen the air traffic control system, as has the distinguished ranking minority member of the Senate Commerce Committee, Senator HOLLINGS. I think the Senator from West Virginia has given an extremely important address this afternoon in terms of highlighting how critical it is to the safety agenda of the American people. You cannot do what is needed to improve safety for airline passengers in this country without following the recommendations of the Senator from West Virginia. I wanted him to know that his remarks were heard, and heard clearly, by this junior member of the Commerce Committee. 
   I will wrap up this afternoon by thanking again Senator SHELBY and Senator LAUTENBERG for their support of the two amendments I am offering that will be voted on in the morning. They are simple, straightforward amendments calling for 
   disclosure with respect to overbooking of airline flights, making sure the passengers can actually know about the lowest fares that are available, whether it is over the telephone or on a web site. 
   As we wrap up this afternoon, my understanding is that we will have additional time to discuss this on the floor of the Senate tomorrow morning. I am very proud to have the support of the chairman of the subcommittee, Mr. SHELBY, and the ranking minority member, Mr. LAUTENBERG, on the two amendments that will come up tomorrow morning with respect to disclosure. I also thank their staffs and the staffs of the Commerce Committee, who have been working to make it possible, procedurally, for the Senate to consider these in the morning. 
   With that, I yield the floor. 
   Mr. LAUTENBERG addressed the Chair.

   Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President and colleagues, for many months now the Nation's airlines have been doing their utmost to prevent the Congress from enacting meaningful customer service protections for airline travelers. The airline industry lobbyists have fanned out across the Nation's capital telling our colleagues that meaningful protections for consumers--such as the right to timely and accurate information--are going to increase the costs for airline passengers, reduce service, and to hear them tell it, it is practically going to bring about the end of Western civilization as we know it. 
   As part of their campaign to prevent the enactment of enforceable legislation to protect the consumer, the airline industry has made a host of voluntary pledges to improve passenger service. 
   Today, I am releasing two reports, one done by the General Accounting Office and the other done by the Congressional Research Service, that show the voluntary pledges made by the airline industry are worth little more than the paper on which they are written. 
   Let me be specific. 
   After evaluating the airline industry's proposals, it is clear the airline industry provides passengers rights in three categories: 
   First, rights that they already have; second, rights that the airline industry is reluctant to write into the legalese that constitute the contract between the airline and the customer; and finally, their rights that are ignored altogether. 
   For example, among the several rights airlines refuse to provide is disclosure about overbooking on flights. If you call an airline this afternoon and ask about a particular flight and it is overbooked, the airline is not required to tell you that before they take your money. 
   When I and other advocates for the consumer have asked them to provide just this information--we are not calling for a constitutional right to a fluffy pillow on an airline flight but just the information about overbooking--the airline industry simply won't follow through. The fact is, the industry's voluntary pledges are gobbledygook. 
   To determine if there was any substance to them at all, I asked the General Accounting Office and the Congressional Research Service to compare the voluntary pledges made by the industry to the hidden but actually binding contractual rights the airline passengers have that are written into what are called contracts of carriage. The General Accounting Office found that of the 16 pledges the airline industry has made to consumers, only 4 are actually provided in the contracts of carriage. Three of them are mandated already by Federal regulation, and most of them are left out altogether, including informing the customers of the lowest fare, informing customers about delays, cancellations and diversions, returning checked bags within 24 hours, providing credit card refunds within 7 days, informing the passenger about restrictions on frequent flier rules, and assigning customer service representatives to handle complaints and other problems. 
   Moreover, the airlines are not exactly tripping over themselves to rewrite these contracts of carriage, the actual contract that protects the consumer. When General Accounting Office officials contacted the airlines to inquire about actually putting teeth into pledge language, the officials at 10 of the major airlines said they were ``considering revisions'' to their contracts of carriage to reflect at least some of the customer service plans. Even more importantly, if the passenger wants to know what their actual contractual rights are to these key services, the airlines have made it very difficult for the consumer to find out. The Congressional Research Service points out:  
   Frontline airline staff seems uncertain as to just what contracts of carriage are.  
   The Service found:  
   Even if the consumer knows that they have a right to the information, they must accurately identify the relevant provisions of the contract of carriage or take home the address or phone number, if available, of the airline's consumer affairs department, send for it, and then wait for the contract of carriage to arrive in the mail.  
   As the Congressional Research Service puts it, with their usual diplomacy and understatement:  
   The airlines do not appear to go out of their way to provide easy access to these contracts of carriage.  
   I hope my colleagues will read the actual specifics included in the airlines so-called ``customer first'' pledge. What they will see is a lot of high sounding rhetoric about improving service to the passengers, but the harsh reality is, it is business as usual. 
   Last year, there were an unprecedented number of complaints about airline service. Based on the figures I have just obtained for the first 6 months of this year, there has been another huge increase, in fact a doubling, in the number of consumer complaints about passenger service. It is easy to see why, when you examine how hedged and guarded the airline industry is with respect to actually giving consumers meaningful and timely information that will help them make their choices 
   about travel. 
   For example, let us look briefly at the pledge to offer the lowest fare available on airline flights. What this means is if a consumer uses the telephone to call an airline and asks about a specific flight on a specific date in a specific class, the airline will tell them the lowest fare, as they are already required to do. But not only will they not provide you relevant information about lower fares on other flights on the same airline, they won't even tell you about lower fares that are probably available on their web page. The reason why is simple: They have got you when they have you on the telephone, and they will sell you the ticket when it is an opportunity to sell it and they can make money on it. But when it is a chance to help the consumer and the consumer can get a break by knowing about other fares available on the web page, there is no disclosure 
   The purchase of an airline ticket today in America is like virtually no other consumer choice. Unlike movie theaters that sell tickets to a movie or a sporting goods store that sells soccer balls, the airline industry provides no real assurance that you will be able to use their product as intended. Movie theaters can't cancel shows because they don't have enough people for a show, but airlines cancel flights when they don't have enough passengers. The sporting goods store can't lure you in with a pledge to give you that soccer ball at an attractive price and then give you a less desirable product at a greater cost after you get there. But the airline industry can do both of those things. They can make arbitrary cancellations. They can lure you in for a product and, after they have you, not make it available. The fact is, the airline industry is insisting they ought to be outside the basic laws that protect consumers in every other economic field from coast to coast. 
   I conclude by saying that over the next few weeks the Congress is going to have the chance to right the wrongs spelled out by the Congressional Research Service and the General Accounting Office studies that I release today. I look forward to working with my colleagues on a bipartisan basis to make sure airline passengers across this country get a fair shake. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor and thank my colleague from Nevada.

   Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I express my appreciation to the Senator from Nevada for all his effort in working with me and other colleagues from the Pacific Northwest on this issue. Folks in your part of the United States want to be sensitive to environmental values and economic needs in our communities. As a result of recent court decisions and other problems, instead of that win-win, we have essentially had a lose-lose, where we are not doing what is needed to protect environmental values; nor are we doing what is needed to protect communities--particularly rural communities--that have very legitimate economic concerns as a result of having resource-dependent economies. 
   The Senator from Nevada has been working with us. I will begin my remarks by saying what we are trying to do in the Bryan-Fitzgerald-Wyden amendment is incorporate some of the thinking that has been behind what the chairman of the subcommittee, Senator GORTON, has talked about on the floor and some of what Senator ROBB tried to do last week with respect to environmental values. I think if you look at the Bryan-Fitzgerald-Wyden amendment, you will see, to some degree, efforts to try to reconcile some of the important points that Senator GORTON has made and the important points Senator ROBB has made that are brought together in our amendment so we can take advantage of an opportunity to both improve the environment and move timber more quickly from the forests to the mills. 
   When President Clinton took office in 1993, he came to the Pacific Northwest with a promise to help resolve the battle over owls and old growth. The administration put in place the Northwest Forest Plan which promised protection for my State's ancient forests, and also sustainable forestry for a State that has long been dependent in rural communities on forestry for family wage jobs. 
   Over the past few months, the plan, which has already been failing to deliver what it promised, threatened to come completely undone when a Federal judge ruled that the Forest Service had failed to conduct biological surveys--an obligation known as survey and management--as required under the court-approved Northwest Forest Plan. 
   Later this week, in the Forestry Subcommittee, chaired by my friend and colleague, Senator CRAIG, we are going to talk about who exactly is to blame for that fiasco. But today, we in the Pacific Northwest are left with dozens of suspended timber sales as a result of the Forest Service's failure to follow through on environmental protection obligations. 
   The Bryan-Fitzgerald-Wyden amendment would earmark resources for this costly environmental work and place a stringent timetable on the completion of the surveys' environmental impact statement. Thus, by making sure these environmental surveys get done, and done quickly, we will help both the environment and timber workers do well. 
   Building on the philosophy that we heard from Senator GORTON, that the program has not worked very well, and what we heard from Senator ROBB about the importance of environmental values, what Senator BRYAN, Senator 
   FITZGERALD, and I are trying to do is incorporate some of the thinking behind both of those approaches so we can try to put this survey and management program on track but also bring to it some of the accountability that Senators GORTON and CRAIG are absolutely right in saying has been lacking in the past. 
   I have shared, as I say, many of the concerns of the manager of the bill. But I don't think we can simply waive survey and management requirements altogether because what will happen is that will lead to a full employment program for lawyers if it were adopted and, even if in the short term, very serious problems because the bill would be vetoed by the President if section 329 survived conference in its present form. 
   In August of this year, right after the first Northwest Forest Plan timber sales were enjoined, Senator MURRAY and I sent a letter to Under Secretary Lyons asking that the Forest Service and BLM meet with our offices to discuss how and why the survey and management requirements were stopping the Northwest Forest Timber Program and what could be done about it. 
   Initially, in the August meeting between agency staff and the congressional staff, held both in D.C. and in my hometown of Portland, the Forest Service stated that $10 million more funding for personnel and addressing the scientific issues was necessary in order to get the survey and management program back on track. So let's be clear; the survey and management program is an unparalleled undertaking. It is going to provide new scientific protocols and data that can be useful in forests across the country. But it has to be done in a way that addresses the legitimate issues with respect to accountability that our colleague from Washington State, Senator GORTON, and Senator CRAIG of Idaho have addressed on this floor. 
   So the Bryan-Fitzgerald-Wyden amendment directs $10 million for survey and management requirements to help the Forest Service conduct surveys on judicially stalled timber sales for species with known survey protocols. It will help the Service create protocols for the species currently lacking such data. This money starts us toward completion of the environmental scientific work that is necessary to move timber sales toward harvest. 
   During the August meetings, the Forest Service was initially optimistic about the time it would take them to complete the environmental impact statements which they believe will answer the questions with respect to the success of the Northwest Forest Plan. At first, the Forest Service told me in a draft response to the letter Senator MURRAY and I sent them that the environmental impact statement, draft statement, would be completed this fall, and that the final would be ready early next year. Now the Forest Service is telling us that the draft will be available for public comment by December and perhaps the final environmental impact statement will be ready in May or June of next year. They have not given us any indication, other than overlap of this work with the holidays, why the timing of the work had to change. 
   The Forest Service has been working on this project since 1997 and knew since 1994 that the survey and management requirement was coming down the pike. I certainly wasn't one who succeeded in getting his homework always done on time, but the Forest Service's timetable reflects extraordinarily poor planning, by any calculus. 
   It is time for some accountability. We are going to have a chance to discuss those accountability issues later this week. I note the chairman of the Forestry Subcommittee has arrived. He knows I share many of his concerns about the lack of accountability with respect to the Forest Service on survey and management, and in other key areas. 
   The Forest Service needs administrative deadlines to move this process along. They need to make this environmental impact statement a priority and get it done. The Bryan-Fitzgerald-Wyden amendment states the survey and management draft environmental impact statement should be completed  by November 15 of this year, and the final version of that impact statement should be published by February 14, 2000. 
   Those deadlines also allow for the public a comment period required by law, plus some additional time for open and public discussion. 
   This administration for years has been promising Congress they will get to work on the Northwest Forest Plan. The time for those empty promises is over. This administration needs some direction, and they need the extra money to achieve it. 
   Finally, let me reiterate what I think the Bryan-Fitzgerald-Wyden amendment does. I say this to colleagues on both sides of the aisle. It incorporates much of the important analysis done by Senator GORTON and Senator CRAIG with respect to why the survey and management program has not worked and why the administration has dragged its feet on it while at the same time trying to incorporate the environmental concerns Senator ROBB has legitimately addressed to ensure this program gets carried out. 
   Under the Bryan-Fitzgerald-Wyden amendment, we would add the money necessary to carry it out. But we would finally have some real accountability and some real deadlines to make sure these important obligations, both in terms of environmental protection and in terms of meeting economic needs of rural communities, are addressed. 
   I hope my colleagues on both sides will support it. If we adopt this amendment, I believe the end result will be healthier forests and a healthier timber economy. 
   I, again, thank my colleague from Nevada for all of his assistance. I know my colleagues from Idaho and Washington as members of our Senate delegation from the Northwest have strong views on this as well. The Senator from Idaho knows how much I enjoy working with him. We are getting ready to go forward with our accounting payment legislation which gives us a chance to break some gridlock in that area. I am hopeful as we go forward on this important Interior bill we can also break the gridlock with respect to survey management and have additional funds that are needed but also additional accountability. That is why I am hopeful my colleagues on both sides of the aisle will support the Bryan-Fitzgerald-Wyden amendment. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, this has been an important debate--important for the Northwest and important as it relates to the direction of the Forest Service. 
   I think my colleagues on the other side of the aisle would be surprised to know that I agree with a number of the things they have said about the Forest Service not knowing where they are headed. Frankly, I have made much stronger statements than that in the last few days. It is very clear in the Pacific Northwest that the Forest Service is just flailing around. 
   The chairman of our subcommittee and I both read these Oregonian editorials talking about blame with respect to gridlock in the forests. In the Northwest, the Oregonian, our newspaper, editorialized that:  
   Forest biologists searching for signs of the rare mosses listed above ought to look under the backsides of the federal officials managing the forest plan. That seems a relatively undisturbed habitat.  
   I think it is fair to say that those Forest Service officials knew for years they had to go forward with survey and management in a responsible fashion and haven't done so. So I think the comments that have been made by the chairman of the Forestry Subcommittee, Senator CRAIG, and the chairman of the full committee, with respect to the Forest Service not knowing where it is going, are ones that I largely share. 
   But where we have a difference of opinion and where I think the Bryan-Fitzgerald-Wyden and the substitute help to bring together colleagues on both sides of the aisle is that the history of the last few years demonstrates very clearly that just spending more money on the timber sale program  doesn't help these rural communities either from an economic standpoint or from an environmental standpoint. 
   The fact of the matter is, Madam President and colleagues, for the last several years this Congress has authorized a greater expenditure for the timber sale program than the President of the United States has called for. 
   This Congress has appropriated more funds for the timber sale program, and the fact is the problems in many of these rural communities in the West, from an economic and environmental standpoint, are getting worse. 
   So I think the notion that throwing more money at the timber sales program is going to address the needs of these rural communities is not borne out by the events of the last few years. 
   What needs to be done--and what Senator BRYAN and Senator FITZGERALD and I are trying to do--is to put in place a program with real accountability. 
   My colleague from Idaho talked about the need for accountability of the Forest Service. The chairman of the full Senate Energy Committee has correctly said more emphasis needs to be placed on oversight. The fact of the matter is that under the Bryan-Fitzgerald-Wyden amendment, for the first time the Congress will put in place a program in the survey and management area which has essentially shut down the forests and that will have real accountability. Under our amendment, the survey and management draft environmental impact statement will have to be completed by November 15 of this year, and the final version of that impact statement would have to be published by February 14 of 2000. 
   That is allowing for public comment. That is accountability. That is giving some direction to the Forest Service on the key issue that has in effect shut down the forests in our part of the country. 
   So the choice is, do we do business as we have done in the past, which is to throw money, for example, at a particular program, the timber sale program, or do we try, as the Bryan-Fitzgerald-Wyden amendment does, to tie that amendment to dealing with the key concerns that have shut down our forests and put in place real accountability in the process? 
   Beyond that, I think the only other major difference I have, as some of our colleagues on the other side of the aisle, is that they have correctly said they don't want the courts to make forest policy. Section 329, as it stands in this bill, is a lawyer employment program. This is going to be a huge bonanza for lawyers as it stands in its present form. 
   That is why I am hopeful that colleagues, regardless of how they feel about section 329 in its original farm, regardless of how they voted on the Robb legislation earlier, will see that the approach that Senator BRYAN and Senator FITZGERALD and I are talking about tries to borrow from the philosophy of both of the approaches that have been debated on the floor of the U.S. Senate. I happen to agree with Senator GORTON and Senator CRAIG that the survey and management program has not worked. The Forest Service has dawdled. They have known what they were supposed to do for some time. 
   We can read editorials to each other for many hours to compete for who is the toughest on the Forest Service. But the fact is they haven't known where they are going, and we are going to try to get them on track. But this amendment is the very first effort in the Senate to put them on track in a way that locks in the additional money they need with a specific timetable and a blueprint for ensuring accountability. 
   I think for that reason it is absolutely essential that we pass it. I think it will give us an opportunity to go forward in the days ahead, which is what we are going to try to do in the oversight hearing that Chairman CRAIG is holding on Thursday. 
   I am very hopeful that those Members of this body who understand how wrong it is for the courts to make forestry policy and how important it is to have a balanced approach that will tie additional funding with accountability--and a recognition that there is more to this than appropriating additional funds for the timber sale program--will support our bipartisan amendment. 
   I gather we will not have a final vote on this amendment until tomorrow, and perhaps we will hear from some additional colleagues. But I am very hopeful, regardless of how a Member of this body voted on those Robb amendments or felt about the original section 329, the Gorton language, that they will see what Senator BRYAN and Senator FITZGERALD and I are trying to do, which is pull together an approach that will give the Forest Service some direction, give them some accountability, and do it in a responsible fashion. 
   I yield the floor.

    Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I rise today to draw the Senate's attention to National Assisted Living Week. The National Center for Assisted Living is sponsoring National Assisted Living Week this week to highlight the significance and the hope that this type of service can provide seniors. 
   Assisted living is a long term care alternative for seniors who need more assistance than is available in retirement communities, but do not require the heavy medical and nursing care provided by nursing facilities. Approximately one million of our nation's seniors have chosen the option of assisted living in this country. This demonstrates a tremendous desire by seniors and their families to have the kind of assistance that they need in bathing, taking medications or other activities of daily living in a setting that truly becomes their home. 
   This year's theme of National Assisted Living Week is ``A Community of Families'' and I think that is appropriate because assisted living encourages the involvement of families in the lives of the residents of assisted living facilities, and because this option can mean so much for seniors and their families. 
   Oregon has led our nation in pioneering the concept of assisted living and the state spends more state health dollars to provide assisted living services than any other state in our nation. Assisted living has taken different directions in different states and I believe providing these choices for consumers is important to provide security, dignity and independence for seniors. 
   Assisted living will become even more important as an option of seniors and their families as our nation experiences the tsunami of aging baby boomers. It is important for us to continue to support options that allow seniors and their families a choice of settings in order to assure that they get the level of care that they need.

    Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, today Senator SNOWE and I are introducing legislation to provide seniors with insurance coverage for prescription drugs. This legislation, the Seniors Prescription Insurance Coverage Equity Act, SPICE, is the only bipartisan, market-based approach to provide seniors with choice and access to coverage that is actually paid for. It will give seniors the same kind of coverage that their member of Congress has. 
   The key issue for seniors around our nation, when it comes to the issue of prescription drugs, is affordability. Our proposal will assure that each and every senior who voluntarily chooses to enroll in a SPICE plan will have the bargaining power of HMOs and of the large insurers whose job it is to get the best price they can. At least 13 million seniors have no prescription drug coverage at all. Those seniors get penalized twice: they have to pay all their costs, and they pay more because they can't get the negotiated rate that the insurers and HMOs can. This bill will level the playing field for those seniors giving them affordability and access. 
   We know the kinds of drugs that are coming on the market now can help save lives, better the health status of an older person and, in many instances, save dollars because seniors taking their prescription drugs as they are told to by their doctor will prevent costly hospitalizations and the progression of disease. If we were to create Medicare today from scratch, there would be no questions about including prescription drug coverage. If we want to assure that Medicare beneficiaries stay healthy longer we must provide prescription drug coverage. If we want to be thoughtful, prudent purchasers of health care, we must find a way to assure seniors access to the drugs. 
   I believe the Snowe-Wyden proposal is that thoughtful, prudent and reasonable way. It assures a variety of options for coverage, and it assures that we bring real dollars to the table to pay for the program. There is no smoke and mirrors, no IOUs or other budget gimmicks in this plan. 
   The Snowe-Wyden proposal will be funded by funding from the non-Social Security on-budget surplus and a 55-cent increase in the tobacco tax. During this body's deliberations of the budget resolution, an amendment that Sen. SNOWE and I offered received 54 votes, including 12 Republican votes to do just this--fund a prescription drug benefit for seniors with an increase in the tobacco tax. 
   The SPICE legislation creates a senior-oriented program using the Federal Employees Benefit Program (FEHBP) as a model to provide benefits that include prescription drugs and other non-Medicare covered benefits. This benefit would be open to every beneficiary and be voluntary. However, if the senior elected coverage later rather when they were first eligible, the individual would pay incrementally more the longer he or she waited to choose a comprehensive coverage option. 
   The individual senior would be able to select from an array of drug policies and Medicare+Choice plans with prescription drugs coverage. This would be voluntary. No senior would have to change what their current coverage is if they do not choose to do so. All plans would be offered by private sector companies. For beneficiaries under 150 percent of the poverty level--$12,075 for a single senior and $16,275 for a couple, the federal government would pay the entire premium. For those between 150 percent and 175 percent of the federal poverty level, the amount the federal government would pay phases down from 100 percent of premium to 25 percent of the premium amount. For beneficiaries at 175 percent of poverty and over, the federal government would pay 25 percent of the premium amount. 
   Our SPICE benefit will be administered by a new Board that would be separate from the Health Care Financing Administration but report to the Secretary of Health and Human Services. The Board would approve plan designs and premium submissions, approve and distribute consumer education materials, develop enrollment procedures and make recommendations concerning additional funding, further ability to pay mechanisms and other steps needed to assure continuing availability of comprehensive coverage as seniors' health needs change over time. 
   Many of us would prefer to do an overhaul of Medicare and modernize it to include benefits like prescription drugs. However, the thirteen million Medicare beneficiaries who need coverage and the millions who have coverage that does not truly help them, need a way to get meaningful coverage today. This proposal will do that.

   Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I am pleased that last night the Senate adopted the Abraham-Wyden New Millennium Classrooms Act as an amendment to the reconciliation tax bill. Senator ABRAHAM and I have worked on many technology issues together as members of the Senate Commerce Committee. 
   The New Millennium Classrooms Act is about digital recycling. It gives companies an incentive to recycle technology. It says the computer Bill Gates may see as a dinosaur, is really a dynamic new opportunity for seniors and students who have none. 
   There is a growing need to encourage access to information technology for both seniors and students. The Administration on Aging estimates there are about 11,500 senior centers throughout the United States serving millions of older Americans. The centers offer a variety of services, including employee assistance and educational programs. Equipping senior centers with donated computer equipment could help open the door to employment opportunities. 
   We know there is a growing demand for skilled high tech workers. Just last year, the high tech community came to Congress asking for a large increase in the number of skilled H-1B visas so they could hire foreign workers to fill the gap. Congress agreed to boost the number of H-1B visas from 65,000 to 115,000 for 1999 and 2000. Those are 50,000 jobs that could have gone to Americans. Many seniors have the drive and the desire to keep working; they simply need to gain some basic computer skills. 
   While it is important for all Americans to have equal access to information technology, the most pressing need is in our schools. The Department of Commerce recently published a report, ``Falling Through the Net: Defining the Digital Divide.'' It shows that the rapid build-out of the information superhighway has by-passed many in rural and in less-advantaged urban communities. The report says factors such as race, income and area of residence help limit access to information technology. For example, the study found that households earning more than $75,000 are five times more likely to own computers than those earning less than $10,000. Households earning more than $75,000 are seven times more likely to use the Internet as those earning less than $10,000. 
   We know that very early in the next Century 60% of all jobs will require high-tech computer skills. To prepare our children for the jobs of the future, they not only must have access to technology, but they must be trained to use it as well. But we cannot count on children in low-income and rural communities even to have access to computers. 
   Schools can serve as great equalizers in this equation, giving all children access to information technology resources. However, a 1997 report by the Educational Testing Service found that on average there was only one multimedia computer for every 24 students. In economically disadvantaged communities, the situation is worse: the computer to student ratio rises to one in 32. 
   The purpose of our amendment is to build more bridges between the technology ``haves'' and the ``have nots'' to build more on-ramps to the information superhighway. You can't get 21st Century classrooms, using Flintstones technology. However, technology is not cheap and school budgets are limited, making it tough for schools to upgrade their systems by themselves. The point of our amendment is to enhance existing incentives to businesses to donate computer equipment to schools. 
   There is a federal program in place, the 21st Century Classroom Act of 1997, but its use has been limited. It allows businesses to take a tax deduction for certain computer equipment donations to K-12 schools. But most businesses take longer to upgrade their computers than allowed for under the law. 
   The New Millennium Classrooms Act would make this law work the way it was intended, and include donations to senior centers under this tax credit. First, our legislation would increase the age limit from two to three years for donated equipment eligible for a tax credit. This more realistically tracks the time line businesses follow for their computer upgrades. It will cover hardware that possesses the necessary memory capacity and graphics capability to support Internet and multimedia applications.  
   Second, our bill expands the current limitation of ``original use'' to include both original equipment manufacturers and any corporation that reacquires their equipment. We believe that by expanding the number of donors eligible for the credit, we will expand the number of computers donated to schools and senior centers. 
   Third, our bill provides for a 30% tax credit of the fair market value for school and senior center computer donations, and a 50% credit for donations to schools located in empowerment zones, enterprise communities and Indian reservations. The Department of Commerce report highlights the need to encourage school computer donation in these notoriously under-served communities and we want to target donations toward these communities. 
   Finally, our bill requires an operating system to be included on a donated computer's hard drive in order to qualify for the tax credit. This will ensure students and seniors don't get empty computer shells, but the brains that drive the computers. 
   Our legislation is supported by a wide range of business and education groups. Leaders of technology associations, like the Information Technology Industry Council and TechNet, and the National Association of Manufacturers have joined education associations, such as the National Association of Secondary School Principals and the National Association of State University and Land Grant Colleges, in support of the amendment. 
   The Digital Millennium Classrooms Act promotes digital recycling. It will encourage companies to put their used computers into classrooms instead of into landfills. It will help build a safety net under students trying to cross the digital divide. I thank my colleagues for supporting this amendment, and again wish to commend Senator ABRAHAM for his leadership on this legislation.

   Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, today Senator CRAIG and I are introducing a bill that will help protect the global climate system by improving local natural resource management and strengthening the economy in rural communities. The Forest Resources for the Environment and the Economy Act of 1999 will expand the nation's forested lands and provide effective tools for including forests in our national efforts to fight global warming. The bill focuses on forests because they are the lungs of our planet. Investing in healthy forests is an investment in the health of our environment today and the well-being of our planet for decades to come. 
   In the Pacific Northwest, forests are more than critical environmental resources--they are also a cornerstone of our economy. In debates about forest policies, there are those who have advocated an exclusively environmental pathway, and others who have stressed an exclusively economic pathway. This bill is part of what I believe is a third pathway through the woods--a path to both stronger rural economies and healthier forests. It will reduce the buildup of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere and help protect our global climate for ourselves, our children and our grandchildren. It will provide improved wildlife and fish habitats and protect our waterways. It will enhance our national forests by reducing water pollution within their watersheds. It will provide jobs in the forestry sector in areas that have been hard hit by declining timber harvests. And it will grow additional timber resources on underproductive private lands. 
   The legislation does all of this through an entirely voluntary, incentive-based approach. The bill makes new resources available to private landowners through state-operated revolving loan programs that provide assistance for tree planting and other forest management actions. By quantifying forests' contribution to climate protection, the bill puts the free market to work at turning the initial Federal investment into a long-term source of non-federal funding for forestry projects. And the bill takes an important first step toward reducing greenhouse gases on Federal lands by directing the Forest Service to report to Congress on options to increase carbon storage in our national forests. 
   I am deeply concerned about the risks that we are taking with our unprecedented experiment with the global climate system. Global climate change may jeopardize critical forest and other natural resources that are closely tied with Oregon's economy and our citizens' quality of life. Water managers in the Northwest may be faced with daunting challenges if the predicted climate changes, such as drier, hotter summers, complicate protection and management of water supplies. Over the last Century, the average temperature in Corvallis, Oregon has increased 2.5 degrees Fahrenheit, and average temperatures across Oregon could increase by 5 degrees or more over the next century, putting the elderly in Oregon especially at risk from more intense heat waves. And sea level rise resulting from global warming could eliminate the salt marshes along Tillamook and Coos Bay regions. Given these potential hazards of global warming, the challenge is to find strategies to protect our quality of life that won't cause an economic meltdown. 
   One of the key strategies for meeting this challenge is something this planet has been doing for more than 300 million years--growing abundant and healthy forests. Forests are a critical part of our global climate system. The total amount of greenhouse gases in our atmosphere depends in part on the efficiency of forests and other natural ``sinks'' that absorb carbon dioxide--the most significant greenhouse gas--from the atmosphere. In fact, the world's forests contain 200 times as much carbon as is emitted to the atmosphere each year from burning fossil fuels. The implications are as simple as they are scientifically sound--if we grow more trees, bigger trees, and healthier trees, we will remove more greenhouse gases from the atmosphere and help protect the global climate. According to the Pacific Forest Trust, our forest lands in the United States are only storing one-quarter of the carbon they can ultimately store. Just tapping a portion of this potential by expanding and increasing the productivity of the nation's 737 million acres of forests is an important part of a win-win strategy to slow global warming. 
   And here's the good news--an ounce of investment in our forests is worth not only a pound of global warming cure, but also two pounds of jobs and three pounds of protection for our waterways and wildlife. The bill that I am introducing today will not only protect our global environment, but also will  provide immediate dividends in terms of watershed and habitat protection. It will provide jobs today for tree planting and forest management, and jobs tomorrow in carbon accounting and monitoring to ensure that greenhouse gas reductions are real and verifiable. 
   I recognize that global warming is a large problem that cannot be solved by forestry actions alone. We need a portfolio of approaches, and I continue to strongly support research, development and deployment of energy efficient and renewable technologies that reduce greenhouse gas emissions. But increasing our nation's forest lands is a key part of the solution and something we can do immediately. Forests may not be a silver bullet that will solve the entire global warming problem, but they are a silver lining to the problem that can provide jobs around the country while taking a big step to reverse the buildup of greenhouse gas in the atmosphere. 
   It is sometimes hard to believe that seven years ago Senators from both parties proclaimed their universal support for taking action to protect the climate system and reducing the buildup of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. When the 1992 United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change was ratified by the Senate, Senators from both parties came to the floor to applaud this commitment to begin reducing greenhouse gas emissions. We cannot afford to let the current debates about international treaties paralyze this Congress into inaction when there are opportunities here at home to protect our environment in ways that also provide jobs and economic growth. 
   Forests are one of those opportunities. This bill will take the money that polluters pay when they are caught violating the Clean Air Act and Clean Water Act and use it to expand our forests, protect streams and rivers and help remove greenhouse gases from the air. In fiscal year 1998, $45 million of these environmental penalties were assessed against polluters. There are currently 
   no guarantees that these penalties, which revert to the General Fund, are used to improve our environment. This bill would make this money available as loans to small and medium landowners to cover the upfront costs of tree planting and other projects that grow healthy, productive forests and provide better wildlife habitats. 
   This bill is supported by the National Association of State Foresters and the Society of American Foresters. It responds to recent recommendations of the National Academy of Sciences by providing assistance to overcome the capital constraints that prevent non-industrial, private forest land owners from growing healthy forests. Almost 10 million landowners in the United States own 42 percent of non-industrial, private forest land in parcels of less than 100 acres. Access to these low-interest loans can empower these landowners to improve their lands while providing global environmental protection. 
   Under the bill, State Foresters will be able to give loans for forest projects that remove greenhouse gases from the atmosphere while improving habitats and protecting waterways. For example, loans will be available for planting trees as buffer zones along salmon streams and rivers in areas that are currently being used by livestock or for crop production. Loans will be available to turn thin and poorly stocked forest lands into healthier and more productive lands that remove greater amounts of greenhouse gases from the atmosphere and provide additional timber resources on private lands. And loans will be available to grow trees for use in bioenergy facilities that can provide energy without increasing the greenhouse gases in our atmosphere. 
   These loans must be repaid with interest--money that will be reinvested in additional loans to double and triple the impact of every federal dollar over time. Loans may not be provided for reforestation activities already required under any state or local laws. And the bill ensures that people aren't paid to cut their existing trees in order to receive funding for replanting afterwards. 
   A critical element of the bill is that it harnesses the power of the free market to allow responsible businesses to invest in the nation's forests. Across the nation, companies are voluntarily seeking ways to reduce greenhouse gases. Some companies are going as far as sending money oversees to protect forests in other countries. Forests in Brazil are important, but forests in Bend, Oregon, can do just as good a job at fighting off global warming. In fact, our Northwest forests are some of the best carbon ``sinks'' in the world. This bill provides a way for companies to invest in American forests and know with accuracy the amount of greenhouse gases that are removed from the atmosphere due to their investments. Once businesses recognize that the nation's forests are an opportunity for environmental investment, their entrepreneurial ingenuity will generate new opportunities for consumers and other businesses to tap into this win-win opportunity. 
   We know that this approach works because of the leadership of my home State of Oregon. The loan program is modeled after the innovative Forest Resource Trust, which was established in Oregon in 1993, and is just one of the many ways Oregon continues to lead the nation in state actions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. I am pleased to say that PacifiCorp announced last month that it is contributing $1.5 million to the Forest Resource Trust to support tree planting and reduce greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. This leadership by PacifiCorp will create forestry jobs in Oregon, protect salmon and fish habitat, create new wildlife habitats, and remove greenhouse gases from the atmosphere. I am introducing this bill to make sure that we take advantage of these opportunities across the country and encourage more businesses to invest in the nation's forests. 
   In addition to establishing the state revolving loan programs, the bill makes important changes to the Energy Policy Act of 1992 to strengthen the voluntary accounting and verification of greenhouse gas reductions from forestry activities. The bill directs the Secretary of Agriculture to develop new guidelines on accurate and cost-effective methods to account for and report real and credible greenhouse gas reductions. These guidelines will be developed with the input of a new advisory board representing industry, foresters, states, and environmental groups. 
   This bill is about taking advantage of a clear win-win opportunity. It's a win for the global environment. It's a win for sustainable forestry. It's a win for local water protection. And it's a win for rural communities. 
   For these reasons, the bill is already supported by timber companies and environmental organizations alike. I have already received supportive letters from: American Forest and Paper Association, American Forests, Environmental Defense Fund, Governor John A. Kitzhaber of Oregon, National Association of State Foresters, PacifiCorp, Society of American Foresters, The Nature Conservancy, and The Pacific Forest Trust. 
   I look forward to working with my colleagues to make sure that we pursue this common-sense good step toward protecting the environment and supporting our forest workers.

   Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, the amendment seeks to deter violent crime borne out of prejudice and hatred. Since 1991, almost 50,000 hate crimes have been voluntarily reported to the FBI. More than 8,000 were reported in l997 alone, and many more probably occurred. 
   I am of the view that violent hate crimes stain our national greatness. This amendment cannot erase the stain entirely, but it is a step toward removing the immunity from prosecution that perpetrators have enjoyed for too long. 
   The amendment will close the loopholes in current federal hate crimes law and remove the straightjacket from local law enforcement so they can get federal help when they need it. 
   The amendment does three things: 
   First, it would remove restrictions on the types of situations in which the Justice Department can prosecute defendants for violent crimes based on race, color, religion or national origin. 
   Second, it would assure that crimes targeted against victims because of disability, gender or sexual orientation that cause death or bodily injury can be prosecuted if there is a sufficient connection to interstate commerce. 
   Third, it would require the Attorney General to certify in writing that she had consulted with State and local law enforcement and that they had asked for federal help, or did not have jurisdiction or, as in current law, that federal prosecution is necessary to secure substantial justice in eradicating hate-based crimes. 
   Under current law, the Justice Department can prosecute crimes motivated by race, religion and ethnicity only if two tests are satisfied. First, DoJ must prove bias was the motive. Second, DoJ must prove the perpetrator intended to prevent the individual from doing certain federally protected things, such as serving on a jury, enrolling or attending a public school, or applying for or enjoying employment. 
   Motive for the crime is a matter for the jury to determine. And, as is the case for every element of a criminal offense, DoJ would have to prove motive beyond a reasonable doubt. Motive plays the same rule under federal and state anti-discrimination laws as it does under the current federal hate crimes law. My amendment does not affect this. 
   It is the second test which has prevented the law from reaching many cases where individuals kill or injure others because of racial or religious hatred. In 1994, a jury acquitted 3 white supremacists who had assaulted 3 African-Americans. Jurors revealed after the trial that they felt racial animus had been established but not that the defendants intended to prevent the victims from participating in a federally protected activity. My amendment addresses this limitation. 
   Under my amendment, DoJ would still have to satisfy the first test and prove beyond a reasonable doubt that bias was involved. But in cases of crimes motivated by race, religion and ethnicity, DoJ would no longer be limited to those situations where the victim was engaged in or enjoying a federally protected activity. 
   In 1996, 88 current members of the Senate voted to support a similar provision in the Church Arson Prevention Act. 
   Under my amendment, federal involvement in prosecuting crimes based on sexual orientation, disability or gender AND where bodily injury or death result would be limited to those instances where the violent crime has a sufficient connection with interstate commerce. 
   This provision is critical for the 28 states that have no authority to prosecute bias-motivated crimes based on disability or sexual orientation, and for the 29 states that have no authority to prosecute bias-motivated crimes based on gender, like the Son of Sam serial killings in New York. 
   The amendment would provide two levels of penalties in all cases of hate crimes: 
   1. Imprisonment up to 10 years for persons who cause bodily injury, or through the use of fire, firearms or explosives, attempts to cause bodily injury; and 
   2. Imprisonment up to life if death results or if the offense includes kidnaping, aggravated sexual abuse or an attempt to commit aggravated sexual abuse, or an attempt to kill. 
   Some believe that every crime is a hate crime. Every crime is tragic, but not all crime is based on hate. A hate crime occurs when the perpetrator intentionally chooses the victim because of who the victim is. A hate crime affects not only the victim but an entire community or group of people. 
   Some believe this amendment would provide special protection to certain groups. But it is perpetrators who intentionally single out victims because of who they are in an attempt to send a chilling message to society or others in that group of people. 
   Some argue that hate crimes laws threaten free speech. Hate crimes laws punish violent acts, not beliefs or thoughts, no matter how violent those thoughts or beliefs might be. Nothing in this amendment would prohibit or deny the lawful expression of one's deeply held religious beliefs. However,  causing or attempting to cause bodily injury is clearly not protected speech. 
   Some have expressed concern that this amendment would federalize crimes that are better left to the states to address. Today, there is overlapping jurisdiction in the case of many homicides, bank robberies, kidnaping and fraud. Like these areas, when both federal and state hate crimes statutes apply, there will be no need for federal prosecution in the vast majority of cases. 
   The amendment will not invite a tsunami of new cases. In no one year since the first hate crime law was enacted in 1968 has there been more than 10 indictments. In fact, from 1992 to 1997, federal officials prosecuted only 33 cases, or an average of fewer than 6 hate crimes cases a year. Mr. Eric Holder testified that this amendment will only lead to ``a modest increase in the number of cases.'' The significance of this amendment is to backstop state and local law enforcement by giving them extra tools to fight hate crime, not to open the floodgates to frivolous cases. 
   Even in states with broad hate crimes laws, the higher penalties available under federal statute, the complexity of the investigation, the procedural advantages of a federal prosecution, or the failure of a state prosecution may make federal prosecution desirable. 
   All but 8 states have hate crimes statutes, but only 21 cover sexual orientation, 22 cover gender and 21 cover disability. Despite the clear evidence that last year's brutal murder of Matthew Shepard was motivated by hatred of gays, federal authorities were unable to assist state and local authorities in investigating the case because Wyoming had no hate crime law and federal agencies lacked the authority. 
   Evidence indicates that hate crimes are under reported, but FBI statistics show that since 1991 hate crimes have nearly doubled, with more than 8,000 reported in l997. Race-related hate crimes were by far the most common, accounting for 60%. Hate crime based on religion accounted for 17%, and hate crimes against gays and lesbians, which jumped by 8% last year, accounted for 14% of all hate crimes reported. 
   The federal government has a long history in combating hate crimes: 
   In addition to the landmark civil rights laws of the l960s, 
   In 1990, Congress passed the Hate Crime Statistics Act to keep track of hate crimes; 
   In 1994, Congress enacted the Hate Crimes Sentencing Enhancement Act to allow for increased sentences for offenses found beyond a reasonable doubt to be hate crimes; in 1994 Congress passed the Violence Against Women Act; and in 1996 Congress enacted the Church Arson Prevention Act. 
   Under the able leadership of Senator HATCH, the Judiciary Committee has held several hearings on the problem of hate crimes. In my view the record overwhelmingly established the need for this legislation. 
   As if we need any further evidence, we need only look to the Fourth of July weekend headlines describing brutal acts of violence aimed at Orthodox Jews, Asian-Americans, African-Americans and a gay couple in California. 
   We must correct the deficiencies in current law. Today, a crime motivated by race, religion or ethnic origin can be prosecuted by federal authorities because it occurred on a public sidewalk but not if it took place in the private parking lot across the street. This is wrong. I believe Congress must focus the full force of the federal government on investigating and prosecuting hate crimes. 
   The vote on this amendment will be a referendum on whether members will continue to tolerate violent acts borne of prejudice. 
   In closing, I would say to my colleagues that this is not a problem that needs further study. The evidence is in, and it is clear. We need to send a strong and unequivocal message that hate crimes will no longer be tolerated; that the full force of federal law enforcement will be brought to bear in prosecuting these violent acts. 
   I hope my colleagues will ask themselves the following question. If they have a child or know of a child who has a disability, a child who is gay, or who is a girl, and that child suffers bodily injury or worse, death, simply because of who he or she is, do you want that child to be just another statistic that is studied, or do you want the perpetrator to be prosecuted to the fullest extent allowed by the Hate Crimes Prevention Act?

<TEXT>
   Mr. WYDEN. Thank you, very much. 
   Mr. President and colleagues, I offer this amendment with a number of our colleagues to protect the relationship between health professionals and their patients. 
   What this amendment is all about is essentially ensuring that patients can get all the facts and all of the information about essential health care services for them and their families. 
   If ever there was an amendment that does not constitute HMO bashing, this would be it. 
   I don't see how in the world you can make an argument for saying that in the United States at the end of the century, when doctors sit down with their patients and their families, the doctors have to keep the patients in the dark with respect to essential services and treatment options for them. 
   Unfortunately, that is what has taken place. They are known as ``gag clauses.'' 
   They are chilling the relationship between doctor and patient, and they are at the heart of what I seek to do in this amendment with my colleagues. 
   I think Members of this body can disagree on a variety of issues with respect to managed care. I have the highest concentration of older people in managed care in my hometown in the United States. Sixty percent of the older people in my hometown are in managed care programs. We need this legislation, but at the same time we have a fair amount of good managed care. 
   But today we are saying even though Members of the Senate will have differences of opinion, for example, on the role of government and health care, we will have differences of opinion with respect to the role of tax policy in American health care. 
   If you vote for this amendment, you say we are going to make clear that all across this country, in every community, when doctors sit down with their patients and their families, they will be told about all of their options--all of their options, and not just the ones that are inexpensive, not just the ones that perhaps a particular health plan desires to offer, but all of the options. 
   It doesn't mean the health plan is going to have to pay for everything. It means the patients won't be in the dark. 
   By the way, when I talked to the distinguished Senator from Massachusetts shortly after coming to the Senate, a majority of Members of this body said these gag clauses should not be a part of American health care. 
   Let's differ on a variety of issues--the role of government, the role of taxes--but let's not say, as we move into the next century in the era of the Internet and the opportunity to get information, that the one place in America where you keep patients in the dark would be when they sit down with their provider and cannot be told all the options. 
   There are other important parts of this amendment. 
   One that complements the bar on gag clauses, in my view, is the provision that makes sure providers would be free from retaliation when they provide information to their patients, when they advocate for their patients. 
   This amendment is about protecting the relationship between patients and their health care providers. If ever there was something that clearly did not constitute HMO bashing, it is this particular amendment. 
   Unfortunately, across this country we have seen concrete examples of why this legislation is needed; why, in fact, we do have these restrictions on what forces health care professionals to stay in line rather than tell their patients what the options are with respect to their health care. We have seen retaliation against health care workers who are trying to do their job. 
   It strikes me as almost incomprehensible that a Senator would oppose either of these key provisions. What Member of the Senate can justify keeping their constituents in the dark with respect to information about health care services? I don't see how any Member of the Senate can defend gag clauses. That is what Senators who oppose this amendment are doing. This amendment says to patients across America that they will be able to get the facts about health care services. 
   We talked yesterday about costs to health care plans. What are the costs associated with giving patients and families information? That is what this legislation does. In addition, it says when providers supply that information, plans cannot retaliate against providers for making sure that consumers and families are not in the dark. 
   We have seen instances of that kind of retaliation. It strikes me that it goes right to the heart of the doctor-patient relationship if we bar these plans from making sure patients can get the truth. It goes right to the heart of the doctor-patient relationship if providers are retaliated against, as we have seen in a variety of communities.

   Mr. WYDEN. The Senator is absolutely right. What the Senator has pointed out is that you gut the effort to protect patients from these gag clauses unless you ensure that the providers are in a position to do their job and not get retaliated against and not face this prospect of getting financial incentives when they do their job. 
   The Senator from Massachusetts is absolutely right. We are making sure that providers can be straight with their patients. We are actually giving them the chance to carry out that antigag clause effort by making sure they will not be retaliated against and by making sure they will not face the prospect of their 
   compensation in some way being tied to doing their job. 
   I am very hopeful all of our colleagues can support this amendment. It tracks what the majority of the Senate is already on record in voting for, the effort that the Senator from Massachusetts and I led in the last Congress shortly after I came here. 
   I was director of the Gray Panthers at home in Oregon for about 7 years before I came to Congress. I can see a lot of areas where Democrats and Republicans have differences of opinion on  American health care. There are a lot of areas where reasonable people can differ. I don't see how a reasonable interpretation of what is in the interest of patients and providers can allow for gag clauses and then give these plans the opportunity to vitiate any effort to bar gag clauses by saying: If you try to be straight with your patients, we will retaliate against you; we will tie your compensation to your keeping these parties in the dark. 
   I hope my colleagues will support this amendment. It shouldn't be partisan. It doesn't constitute HMO bashing. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. WYDEN. I appreciate my colleague yielding. I so appreciate his leadership because this is a chance, with the Reed proposal, to make sure the consumers in this country can get what they need without litigation. I hope Members of the Senate will see this ought to be the wave of the future. It is a revolution in the concept of consumer protection because what this part of our proposal does, under the leadership of the Senator from Rhode Island, is essentially say: Let's try to help the patients and the families early on in the process. Let's not let problems fester and continue and eventually result in huge problems which can lead to litigation. 
   It seems to me--I want the Senator from Rhode Island to address this--what he is doing is essentially changing consumer protection so it ought to be at the front end when problems have not become so serious.

   Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, well over 2 hours ago I offered the first-degree amendment that deals with an issue that ought to be totally nonpartisan, and that is protecting the relationship between health care professionals and their patients. The distinguished Senator from Texas is on the floor. I think he illustrated what the debate has now become. He wanted to talk about the Clinton health care plan of 1994. What my colleagues and I are here to talk about is giving patients and their families a voice in 1999. 
   In over 2 hours of discussion on the floor of the Senate, there has not been one argument--not one argument--advanced against our provision involving gag clauses; not one argument advanced against our provision protecting the providers from retaliation; not one argument advanced as it relates to this matter of making sure there are not financial incentives to keep the patients in the dark. 
   In 2 hours on the floor of the Senate, not one single argument was made against those positions. I think it is because the Senate understands that the free flow of information between patients and health care providers is at the heart of what we want for our health care system. It is also what this country is all about. It is what the first amendment is all about. 
   I know this has been a very hard debate to follow. We have had discussions about HCFA. We have had discussions  about the Clinton health care plan of 1994. We have heard discussions about costs, about making sure that patients get all the information from their health care providers, and that providers are free from retaliation when they do give out that information, that is not going to cost a good health care plan a penny. Maybe if you are offering poor quality care it may end up costing you a little bit of money but giving people information, protecting their first amendment rights, is not going to cost a penny. 
   I am very hopeful our colleagues, when we get back to it, will support the first-degree amendment that was before the Senate a little over 2 hours ago, and recognize that, in the space of that time, not one single argument--not one--has been advanced against the idea that there ought to be a free flow of information. We ought to protect the relationship between health professionals and their patients. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, it is a great honor to be on the floor today to express my special appreciation at being able to work with Senator MCCAIN, Senator DODD, and so many of our colleagues on both sides of the aisle on this important legislation. 
   This bill is designed with one point and that is to make sure that America's prosperity does not screech to a halt when the calendar pages flip over to start a new millennium. I am of the view that with this bill, millions of consumers and businesses are more likely to be on line at the turn of the century than waiting in line for a courtroom date. 
   I am especially pleased at the bipartisan efforts to make sure the individual consumer was protected in this legislation. This legislation allows consumers to get punitive damages against the bad actors. It makes sure consumers cannot be ripped off with fraudulent misrepresentations. It greatly expands the opportunity for consumers to bring cases in State rather than Federal court. And the conference report ensures that the individual consumer doesn't get the shaft because they are going to be in a position to be made whole when you take the entire package of remedies that would be available to them. 
   I am going to focus for just a moment on the 20 major changes that were made in this legislation after it left the Senate Commerce Committee; seven of them Chairman MCCAIN and I agreed on and one of them was a bottom-line proposition for me. The Senator from South Carolina, who is so eloquent with respect to the rights of plaintiffs in our country, was concerned, legitimately, about the long-term ramifications of this 
   legislation. At my insistence, after the Senate Commerce Committee completed its work, Chairman MCCAIN added a 3-year sunset provision to this legislation. So this is going to be a bill to deal with a finite, discrete problem, not something that is going to linger for decades and decades. 
   We also eliminated the vague Federal defenses that were involved early on. We dropped the preemptive standards for punitive damages. We made sure that bad actors were not going to get a free ride. We restored joint liability for defendants who knowingly committed fraud. There were extra damages for plaintiffs facing insolvent defendants and we restored limited liability for directors and officers. That is what we began with after it left the Senate Commerce Committee and why I was pleased to join with Chairman MCCAIN. 
   Then Senator DODD, who is the Democrats' leader on these technology issues and who has given me, as a junior Member of this body, so much counsel, came along and made an additional set of important changes so as to particularly protect small businesses. We also went further with respect to officers and directors, and we made sure that plaintiffs were not going to face tougher evidentiary standards because of the good work done by the Senator from Connecticut. 
   Then we went to the conference committee and there were 10 major changes made to address concerns of the White House. In the area of proportionate liability, we doubled the orphan share for the solvent defendants, we tripled the orphan share for defendants when the plaintiffs were bad actors, and we assured that individual consumers facing insolvent defendants were made whole. 
   We made a number of changes in the class action area. We boosted the monetary threshold. In committee, when we began it was at $1 million. Now it is at $10 million. We boosted the class size from 50 to 100 plaintiffs. We also added provisions to make sure cases could be dealt with under remand provisions to assist the consumer. 
   Finally, there were changes in securities law to exempt private securities claims under this act, strong provisions with respect to contract enforcement. And to address a number of the important issues that our colleague from North Carolina has raised with respect to economic loss, we stipulated the economic loss rules would apply in a number of instances so as to give the consumer yet another tier of protection. 
   Our Nation needs a game plan for Y2K. This legislation is not going to solve all of the Y2K problems that crop up early in the next century. But what we will do by passing this legislation is ensure that we do not compound the problems we know are going to occur. We are doing it in a way that is going to ensure consumers are made whole, that bad actors face the stiffest of penalties, and at the same time we do not encourage mindless litigation that does nothing other than drain the vitality out of our economic prosperity. 
   I have believed for a long time that failure to pass legislation in this area would be similar to lobbing a monkey wrench into the Nation's technology engine which is driving our prosperity. This legislation gives us the opportunity to keep that prosperity going. I am very honored to have had the opportunity to be part of this effort. 
   I pay special thanks, in wrapping up my remarks, to my colleague, Senator DODD, the Democratic leader on these technology issues. A little bit after midnight on Monday--I 
   guess that would be early Tuesday morning--this relatively young Senator was getting a little pooped and beginning to wonder how much longer I could keep going. The distinguished Senator from Connecticut said: This is not an option. We are going to stay at it until this legislation gets done. I say to my pal from Oregon, I am going to be talking to the President of the United States tonight. 
   I looked at my watch and I thought: Well, it is quarter to 1. This is going to be interesting, to learn a little bit more about this call. But in fact, as a result of the efforts of Senator DODD, the work that was done by Chairman MCCAIN and his staff and a variety of colleagues on both sides of the aisle in those early morning hours, on Tuesday we consummated the 20 major changes that were made in this legislation to ensure we had a bipartisan bill. So I have to tell you, this legislation, which was on the ropes early Tuesday morning with a lot of us thinking that it was going down for the count, now is a bill that our body can be proud of. It is a genuine compromise. I am not going to continue further because I know there are a number of colleagues who wish to speak as well. But I do want to pay tribute to a number of our staff who put in these extraordinary hours. 
   I see Marti Allbright and Mark Buse over there, with Chairman MCCAIN; Senator DODD's staff as well. Carol Grunberg, who is here with me, is sort of the Senate's Bionic Woman. She just kept going when it was so important to keep the parties together. 
   I am proud to be part of this effort. I look forward to what I hope will be a resounding vote in the Senate before too long. I yield the floor.

    Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, many Americans are benefiting from today's robust economy--unemployment is down, the stock market is up and homeownership is at record levels. 
   Sounds good. But while homeownership levels are up for some, for others, the idea of owning a home is about as realistic as winning the lottery. 
   For millions of working families, paying for the house of their dreams too often turns into a financial nightmare. Homeownership should not be reserved for the wealthiest in our society, but should be within the grasp of every working man and woman. 
   Families with incomes below $25,000 generally cannot afford rent--much less monthly mortgage payments on most homes. Some of these are the people who keep our streets safe, fight fires and teach our children, people who play vital roles in our community. They deserve to own their own homes in the communities they know so well and work so hard to improve. 
   Working families should be able to invest in themselves and in their families rather than put their hard-earned income every month into rent paid to someone else. Houses do more than provide shelter. Houses become homes. They allow adults a chance to become established. They give children a sense of security. They allow small towns to function and big cities to endure. 
   It is no wonder then that we value homeownership in this country. Owning a home is a part of our culture, it's what we call ``the American dream.'' Still, this dream is out of the reach of many Americans. In Oregon, where more than 75 percent of jobs do not pay a living wage for a single parent, housing costs have skyrocketed, forcing nearly half of Oregon renters to spend more than 30 percent of their income on housing and utilities. According to the Department of Housing and Urban Development's guidelines, if someone is spending more than 30 percent of his or her income on housing, they start cutting into other basic needs such as putting food on the table, taking elderly parents to the doctor or clothing kids for school.  
   People should not have to choose between feeding their kids or keeping a roof over their heads. The bill that I am introducing, ``The Promoting Housing Affordability for Working Families Act of 1999,'' will help communities remove the barriers to affordable housing, so working families will not have to make this choice. Many factors, such as excessive rules and regulations, add to the price of a house. Cities and states must work together to remove these barriers. By working together, they can free up rental housing for those who cannot afford to buy a home while making the purchase of a first home easier for folks who have been previously denied the opportunity. 
   This bill addresses the problem on three fronts. First, it brings communities together to form ``barrier removal councils'' so they can identify problems to housing affordability and begin implementing solutions. 
   Second, the bill requires Federal agencies to examine the impact of their regulations on the cost of housing. Determining this information through a ``housing impact analysis'' at the outset will save states, communities and, ultimately, families a lot of hassle down the road. 
   Third, it makes homeownership possible for people who help our communities thrive--teachers, police officers, fire fighters and other public employees. Through incentives such as downpayment assistance and closing cost flexibility this bill helps people live in the communities they serve. 
   Many working families are ready for their first home. They are starting to raise families, move up the ladder at work and are prepared to take on the responsibilities of homeownership. But when they get to the front door, they cannot step over the threshold because they are tied up in unnecessary regulation that drives up home prices. The ``Promoting Housing Affordability for Working Families Act of 1999'' will help these families untangle this regulatory knot and unlock the door to their first home.

   Mr. WYDEN. I just want to, at a convenient time, ask my good friend from Rhode Island to yield for a question or two because I think the Senator has made an excellent presentation on the need to advocate for kids. All the latest research with respect to these children is really dropped-dead material. Unless you get there early, as the Senator from Rhode Island is suggesting, you end up, with a lot of these poor kids, playing catchup ball for the next 10 years. 
   So when it is convenient, I would like to engage the distinguished Senator from Rhode Island in a few questions about some of the other areas where he has contributed on this bill that, frankly, I think ought to help bring the parties together and help us fashion a bipartisan proposal. 
   I just want the Senator from Rhode Island to know how much I appreciate him standing up for those kids who do not have political action committees and do not have clout and cannot speak for themselves. At an opportune time in the Senator's address, I would like to be able to ask the Senator to yield just to address a few other questions about some of the areas on which he has focused.

   Mr. WYDEN. I thank my colleague for yielding. He has made an excellent presentation with respect to the need for strong advocates for these kids. 
   I will turn briefly to another area where the Senator from Rhode Island has, in my view, done yeoman work, and an area, frankly, that I think has sort of gotten lost a little bit in this discussion. That is the proposal the Senator from Rhode Island has made with respect to having ombudsmen or advocates for consumers around the country. It ought to be one of the areas that both political parties could gravitate to, because I believe that what the Senator from Rhode Island has done--of course, we have gotten great input from Families USA and Ron Pollack and some of the folks who have done so much for consumers over the years--is essentially talk about a true revolution in the area of consumer protection. 
   What happened--I have seen this so often since my days as director of the Gray Panthers; I was head of the Gray Panthers at home for about 7 years before I was elected to the House--what we saw was that the consumer would have a problem and, without any advocates or the ability to get it handled early on, a problem that started off relatively modest and minor would just fester and get worse and eventually blossom into a huge controversy which ended up in litigation. 
   As the distinguished Senator from Rhode Island knows, one of the most controversial aspects of this whole debate about managed care is litigation. It seems to me that if the Senate were to adopt the proposal of the Senator from Rhode Island or some version of it, this would shift the focus of consumer protection away from litigation,  away from problems after they have unnecessarily developed into something serious. Instead, we would resolve a lot of the problems early on and we wouldn't need this focus on litigation. 
   Certainly, we ought to have legal remedies for the really outrageous examples of consumer rip-offs and the like. But I think what the Senator from Rhode Island has done, and it is such a valuable service in this debate and a real revolution in consumer protection, is said: Let's get at it early on when the consumer and the families can find somewhere to turn. We will prevent problems then. It can be done relatively inexpensively. 
   I would like the Senator from Rhode Island to elaborate a little bit on this and make sure that over the next few minutes the Senator from Rhode Island can lay out his proposal, on which I am honored to join with him. I think this has the potential of, frankly, being one of the areas where the parties, once they focus on it, can say: This is good public policy that will reduce the need for litigation and, as Ron Pollack and Families USA have said so eloquently, help a lot of consumers when they need it most. Perhaps the distinguished Senator from Rhode Island could take us through it.

   Mr. WYDEN. I appreciate the distinguished Senator yielding. I have felt that he has really gone to great lengths to try to ensure that this could be supported by every Member of the Senate. 
   Frankly, I feel about his proposal much like I do about the gag clause discussion. I think he and I have talked about this. I am probably a lot of things, but one of the last things I guess I would qualify as is an HMO basher. We have a lot of good managed care in my part of the United States. My hometown of Portland has the highest concentration of folks in HMOs in the United States. About 60 percent of the older people are part of a managed care program. 
   The distinguished Presiding Officer, Senator SMITH, and I have worked together on a lot of these issues. Frankly, one of our big concerns is, we do offer a lot of good managed care. We end up getting the short end of the stick in terms of reimbursement. I think what the Senator is talking about with an ombudsman, much like gag clauses where people, of course, ought to be entitled to all of the information about their options, the ombudsman concept is much the same kind of approach to good government. 
   The Senator from Rhode Island has written this now so as to ensure it cannot result in litigation, that this specifically is designed to help consumers at the front end and bars litigation. I don't think the majority of the Senate is aware of that. The Senator from Rhode Island has indicated to this Senator and the Senator from Maine, Ms. COLLINS, who has been very interested in this issue over the years, who has done good work, that he wants to make sure we don't duplicate existing services. 
   I am happy to yield to the Senator.

   Mr. WYDEN. I appreciate the chance to continue this for a moment because the Senator from Rhode Island is essentially being logical. Heaven forbid that actually takes over some of the debate we have. There is nothing partisan about making sure that consumers have all the facts about their health care. That is the effort with respect to barring gag clauses. And there is nothing partisan about this ombudsman approach. 
   I am very hopeful, frankly, that as the Senate learns more about this kind of concept pioneered by the Senator from Rhode Island, Families USA, and others, that we will see some of the good health care plans in this country saying we are going to support this because it makes sense to solve problems early on. 
   Frankly, if we can win support for the REED proposal early on--I am honored to join in on it--I think this will go a long way to eventually resolving the controversy about litigation because I think we will see good advocacy programs early on, and we can confine then the need for litigation to really only the outrageous, outlandish cases where I think every Member of the Senate would say, goodness, this is an area where you really ought to have a legal remedy. But we would have skewed the whole system toward prevention and early intervention, or answering the questions that the Senator from Rhode Island has properly identified. 
   I will tell you that in my hometown, where we do have a lot of good managed care, folks want to see this kind of proposal. They want to see what is laid out in the legislation that our colleagues on this side of the aisle are offering, and they want to see us reach a bipartisan agreement. 
   The Presiding Officer of the Senate and I have had the most competitive elections in the history of the West. We have teamed up together on a whole host of issues in the Senate. 
   It would seem to me that around the ombudsman program and around barring gag clauses, this is another area where essentially partisan politics ought to stop outside the Chamber. We ought to work together to enact a good ombudsman program to say that this is the best anecdote to frivolous litigation, frankly, that we could possibly find. 
   I thank the Senator from Rhode Island, with whom I have enjoyed working for well over a decade on senior and consumer issues, and for the chance to work with him on it. 
   Perhaps by way of wrapping up my question to the Senator from Rhode Island, could he fill us in on progress with other colleagues? I know that Senator COLLINS has been very interested in this issue. She has done good work in her home State of Maine. Perhaps the Senator from Rhode Island could just wrap up by telling us where his proposal stands. I want to assure him and Senator KENNEDY, who has been leading this fight--and I am anxious to work with him. In fact, when I first came to the Senate, just a few weeks after arriving I had a chance to work with the distinguished Senator from Massachusetts on the effort to bar gag clauses. I only wish we had gotten that in place back then several years ago. It is long overdue that we get that protection for consumers as well as the Reed proposal. 
   Perhaps the Senator from Rhode Island could tell us where the ombudsman proposal stands at this time.

   Mr. WYDEN. I will be very brief as well. 
   I think the distinguished Senator from Rhode Island, particularly with Families USA, is on to something that really constitutes a revolution in consumer protection. What we have seen on one issue after another--just a few minutes ago the distinguished Senator from Arizona, Mr. MCCAIN, and Senator DODD of Connecticut, and I were able to get an agreement on the Y2K issue with respect to trying to hold down frivolous lawsuits surrounding Y2K. What the Senator from Rhode Island and Families USA have been able to do is essentially say in the health care system: We are going to do everything we possibly can to limit frivolous lawsuits; we are going to help people when they need it most, when the problem first develops. 
   I want to assure the Senator from Rhode Island and the distinguished Senator from Massachusetts that I am anxious to work with them on this proposal, because I think this is one of the areas where the parties ought to be able to come together. It may sound quaint, but the ombudsman notion is simply good government. It is preventive kind of medicine. 
   I thank the Senator for the chance to work with him on it. I will not ask him to yield further. But I am very hopeful that in the days ahead both political parties can see the merit in this idea and have it included.

   Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, and colleagues, this is going to be an important week in the debate about the future of the Medicare program. The White House is coming forward with several useful Medicare proposals. Democrats and Republicans on both sides of the Hill are similarly focused. 
   This morning I have come to the floor to zero in on the issue of prescription drug coverage for older people under Medicare. I believe if the Senate builds on a bipartisan proposal already approved by a majority of Senators, it will be possible to responsibly add prescription drug coverage to the Medicare program in this session of the Congress. 
   A few weeks ago, 54 Members of this body voted for legislation offered by  Senator OLYMPIA SNOWE and myself to finance prescription drug coverage for seniors under Medicare with a tobacco tax. Senator SNOWE and I have now developed a specific proposal that calls for a 55-cent-a-pack tobacco tax that would be used to cover the prescription drug needs of older people under Medicare. We think that is appropriate because, of course, the Medicare program spends upwards of $10 billion a year simply paying for tobacco-related illnesses that older people have suffered. 
   Under the Snowe-Wyden proposal, we would be able to raise $70 billion in order to cover prescription drug benefits for older people over the next 10 years. That is hard dollars to cover this important benefit. It is not phantom funding. It is not sleight of hand. It is not a kind of wish-and-hope, pie-in-the-sky way to take care of this particular need for older people. It is a concrete, tangible concept. 
   A majority of the Senate, Senators of both political parties, have voted for it. I am very hopeful that it will be possible now for the Senate to build on this support, with bipartisan approval, to actually get the job done and support older people. 
   In the legislation that Senator SNOWE and I have put together, we envision this $70 billion being used to assist older people with the insurance premiums that they now pay for Medicare supplemental policies. As we know, many of our seniors have Medicare supplemental policies. Many of our seniors participate in what is called Medicare Choice, a program that involves Medicare HMOs. It may well be that a number of seniors wish to purchase policies that cover only prescription drugs. 
   But what Senator SNOWE and I have developed would be voluntary. No senior would be required to do it. The Presiding Officer and I will recall the catastrophic care fiasco of several years ago when older people were concerned about being required to pay for something they did not really need or did not particularly want. 
   That would not be the case under the legislation developed by Senator SNOWE and I. It would be voluntary if an older person chose to participate in the program; and $70 billion in real funding would be eligible to assist the older people who desire to have that coverage as part of their Medicare. 
   Senator SNOWE and I believe the best way to deliver this coverage is to build on a model that Members of Congress know a fair amount about, and that is the Federal employee health plan. 
   Senator SNOWE and I recognize that program covers different people than we would be covering under Medicare, so our delivery system for this particular benefit would be a kind of senior citizen's version of the Federal employee health plan. We call it the SPICE Board. It stands for Senior Prescription Insurance Coverage Equity. We consider it a kind of senior citizens' friendly version of the Federal employee health plan. 
   We have incorporated some of the very good ideas that have come from Families USA, the seniors' advocacy group, the National 
   Council of Senior Citizens, and a variety of the senior citizens' organizations, to ensure that the SPICE Board that would deliver this system would offer choices and competition for older people but at the same time would not allow cherry-picking; so that a plan could not take just healthy people, it would make sure there were protections against adverse selection. 
   We bar the use of preexisting conditions. A lot of the problems we have seen with insurance coverage in the past would not be allowed under the SPICE Board because we have incorporated many of the good ideas that have come from AARP and Families USA and the National Council of Senior Citizens so as to ensure that the SPICE Board would offer these benefits to older people in a senior-friendly way. 
   At the same time, it is important to note that this is a competitive model. This will help us to hold costs down because older people would have the kind of bargaining power, through the SPICE Board, that an HMO has today when it bargains for younger people getting prescription drug coverage under the Federal employee health plan. 
   I think it is particularly sad to see older people, many of whom have 16, 18, 20 prescriptions they are using in a year, paying well over $1,000 out of pocket for their medicine. It is particularly outrageous that they end up paying a premium, since they don't have coverage, when they walk into a pharmacy and pay out of pocket. They have to pay more because, in effect, they are subsidizing those who have bargaining power in the private sector who get their coverage through a managed care plan. 
   We use an approach that uses markets, offers choice, avoids price controls, but makes sure that through the SPICE Board, older people would have the kind of bargaining power and clout we see HMOs having in the private sector. 
   I am very hopeful that this week, as the Congress moves to have a vigorous discussion about Medicare--the President's proposal is coming tomorrow; our colleagues on both sides of the Hill expressing great interest in this issue--Members will reflect on the fact that a majority of the Senate has already voted for the Snowe-Wyden proposal to finance this coverage with a tobacco tax. It is only fair, because of the costs Medicare incurs related to tobacco. We know now that a bipartisan group of Senators is willing to at least look at that approach to finance this coverage. 
   I am also very hopeful that our colleagues will steer clear of some of these price control ideas that would create more bureaucracy. Incidentally, most of these price controls just shift the cost onto the backs of other consumers. I am very fearful that if we set up a price control regime for older people under Medicare, a lot of low-income folks, African Americans, Hispanics, and others would end up seeing the costs shifted onto them because they wouldn't have any protection from this price control regime. 
   In addition to the real intangible way that is going to be essential to finance this program, we ought to use a concept the Congress is familiar with for delivering the benefit. Under the Senior Prescription Insurance Coverage Equity Program, the SPICE Program, we would be able to do that. We would be able to deliver the benefit in a way that allows senior citizens to exercise clout in the marketplace and be in a position to hold their costs down. There would be real consumer protections because we have incorporated the good ideas from Families USA and AARP and the National Council of Senior Citizens. 
   I am very hopeful as this debate goes forward this week, our colleagues in the Senate will see there is a chance to avoid some of the bickering and partisanship that has accompanied other issues, look to giving older people this important preventive benefit that is so critical but financing it in a real way, not with phantom kind of money, and then delivering the benefit in a way that steers clear of price controls but gives older citizens in our country the kind of bargaining power an HMO has so the older people can get reasonable prices for their coverage. 
   I know the Presiding Officer has a great interest in this issue. He and I have worked often on this matter. He can count on the fact that Senator SNOWE and I will be visiting with him, as well as other colleagues, because it is our intent to do everything possible to keep the Senate, at least on the prescription drug issue, focused on the real needs of older people and the opportunity to address this issue in this session of Congress with real and hard financing and a delivery system that will work for the 21st century. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I want to respond to some of the points made by the distinguished Senator from North Carolina. But before I do that, I want to talk about what a vote against this legislation means today. 
   A vote against this legislation today means that the high-technology sector, which is driving this Nation's economic prosperity, doesn't deserve the same kind of treatment afforded the airline manufacturers; the high-technology sector doesn't deserve the same kind of treatment afforded the securities industry; the high-technology sector doesn't deserve the same kind of treatment afforded the financial services  sector. I just don't think that makes sense, when it is so clear that we are going to have problems in the next century with respect to Y2K, that we would compound those problems by not giving high technology the same sort of protection that we have given to a variety of other industries. 
   Second, it seems to me that a vote against this legislation is a vote against the Nation's risk-takers, and it is a vote against the Nation's entrepreneurs who are working their heads off today to make their systems Y2K-compliant but are legitimately concerned about frivolous lawsuits. I don't think the Senate ought to be voting today against those risk-takers and entrepreneurs. 
   Third, it seems to me that a vote against this bill fails to recognize how dramatic the bipartisan changes have been to this legislation since it came out of the Senate Commerce Committee. The Senate Commerce Committee bill, as far as I am concerned, was a nonstarter. The House bill is a nonstarter. But this bill puts tough pressure on business and directs systems to cure problems, as well as those who might want to bring suits to mitigate damages. 
   Now, my friend from North Carolina has said repeatedly for days that if you have a problem and you are a small businessperson, you are not going to get to recover anything except the cost of the computer. 
   My question, colleagues, is, Why in the world would the overwhelming majority of the Nation's small businesses be calling for passage of this bill if all they got when there was a problem was the cost of a computer? 
   I agree with the Senator from North Carolina. These are dedicated, thoughtful people. Why in the world would they be in support of a bill if all they got was the cost of the computer? 
   The reason they are for the bill is they get all the rights that are prescribed in the contract that a majority of them signed when they purchased a computer. They get the damages that are the foreseeable consequence of a Y2K problem. They get economic losses as prescribed by State contract law. That is the reason why the overwhelming number of small businesses in this country are for this legislation. 
   The fact of the matter is, colleagues, that the so-called culprits who are behind the Y2K problem are folks who didn't really realize decades ago what we would be faced with at the end of the century. 
   Let me tell you what Alan Greenspan had to say recently on this issue. Alan Greenspan said, ``I am one of the culprits who created the problem. I used to write those programs back in the 1960s and 1970s, and was so proud of the fact that I was able to squeeze a few elements of space by not having to put 19 before the year.'' 
   That is what Alan Greenspan said. He said he was one of the culprits behind the problem. In the infancy of the information age when every byte of memory cost about $1 million, he saved his company a lot of money. Today a million bytes of memory can be bought for less than a penny. 
   This problem was a result of an engineering tradeoff, not some kind of conspiracy of computer geeks. I doubt that any computer programmer ever dreamed that programs written in the 1960s and 1970s would still be running today. 
   But the point of this legislation is to keep the heat on all of our Nation's companies to do everything they can to make the chips and the computers and all of our systems Y2K compliant. Let's get the problem fixed. But let's also have a safety net in order to ensure justice for those who have problems. 
   I want to say to my friend from North Carolina, the distinguished Senator, that he talked about how companies that are big and bad are going to get off the hook; they are going to get a free ride, and, again, you are not going to get anything except the cost of the computer. 
   Let me tell you what the hooks are for those that are big and bad. If you are ripping people off, you are going to get stuck with joint and several liability. You are going to get stuck with punitive damages. That is what happens under this legislation when you are big and bad. 
   But what we say in the many cases where we don't have that kind of conduct--the Senator from North Carolina and I certainly agree on this point--is you will be liable for the proportion of the problem that you caused. We say that the small businesses deserve a break on punitive damages. 
   But let's make no mistake about it, colleagues. If you are big and bad, the hooks in this bill are clear. Nobody is getting off the hook. You get stuck with joint and several liability. You can be held for punitive damages. That is in the text of this legislation. 
   There is a reason, colleagues, why the little guy is for this bill. There is a reason why the overwhelming number of small businesses in this Nation are for the bill. It is that those risk takers, those entrepreneurs, those innovators are saying, as we take the steps to make our systems Y2K compliant, let's also have a safety net so if there are frivolous lawsuits that we aren't going to lose everything as a result. 
   This bill has seen 11 major changes to favor the consumer, the plaintiff, and small businessperson since the legislation left the Senate Commerce Committee. I particularly want to credit the chairman of the committee, Senator MCCAIN, and the Democratic leader on the technology issue, Senator DODD, who have worked so hard to help fashion this proposal. 
   I hope today when we vote that we will not send a message that high technology doesn't deserve the same kind of treatment that airlines get, that the securities industry gets, that the financial services sector gets. Let's pass this bill. Let's send it to the conference with a resounding vote. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, Senator DODD is the Democratic technology leader. I join him now in saying that a vote against this bill is a vote against the entrepreneurs and risk-takers of this Nation who are working their heads off to make their systems Y2K compliant but are legitimately fearful of frivolous lawsuits. 
   Some have said that small businesses cannot recover their economic losses under this bill. If that were the case, why would the Nation's small businesses overwhelmingly support the legislation? 
   The fact is, small businesses can recover economic losses just as they do under the status quo. Specifically, a small business plaintiff can recover whatever economic losses are allowed under State contract law. Many of these State laws say that if profits are lost as a consequence of a Y2K failure, the small business plaintiff can recover their economic losses. 
   Failure to pass this bill would be similar to lobbing a monkey wrench into the high-tech engine that is driving the Nation's economic prosperity. 
   I join with Senator DODD, our technology leader, in urging Democrats to support the legislation.

   Mr. WYDEN. Thank you, Mr. President. 
   I would like to pick up on a couple of points made by Chairman MCCAIN, and particularly on this matter of tackling the issue in a bipartisan way. 
   Certainly, when a consumer business gets flattened early in the next century as a result of a Y2K failure, they are not going to ask, is it a Democratic failure or a Republican failure? They are going to say: I have a problem. What is being done to fix it? 
   The central point we have been trying to make--Chairman MCCAIN, and Senator DODD, who is the Democratic leader of the Y2K effort, and I--is that we have spent many weeks trying to tackle this in a bipartisan way. 
   The fact of the matter is that when the bill came out of the Senate Commerce Committee, we were not at that time able to come before the Senate and say we did in fact have a bipartisan bill. 
   As a result of the negotiations that have taken place for many weeks now--led by Senator DODD, our leader, Senator FEINSTEIN of California who has great expertise in this matter, and a variety of Democrats--we have now a bill that has 11 major changes that assist consumers and plaintiffs in getting a fair shake with respect to any litigation which may develop early in the next century. 
   These were all areas where a number of Members on the Democratic side of the aisle thought that the original Senate Commerce Committee bill came up short. We went to Chairman MCCAIN, and we said we would like to get a good bill; we would like to get a bill the President of the United States could sign; we would like to get a bipartisan bill. 
   We said we had a few bottom lines. One of them was that we were not going to change jurisprudence for all time; this was going to be a time-limited bill. Chairman MCCAIN agreed to our request that this last for 36 months. This is a sunsetted piece of legislation. We insisted this bill not apply to anybody who suffers a personal injury as a result of a Y2K failure. If you are in an elevator or you suffer some other kind of grievous bodily injury as a result of a Y2K failure, all existing tort remedies apply. 
   We took out all the vague defenses that some people in the business community earlier thought were important. We said we are not going to give somebody protection if they just say they made a reasonable effort to go to bat for a plaintiff or the consumer. 
   Those 11 major changes were made to try to be responsive to what the White House and a variety of consumer groups feel strongly about. 
   Frankly, the area I am most interested in, in public policy, is consumer rights. I started with the Gray Panthers. I was director of the Gray Panthers for 7 years before I was elected to the House of Representatives, making sure that consumers got a fair shake and that the little guy was in a position, if they got stuck in the marketplace, to have remedies. That is at the heart of my public service career. 
   I believe this is a balanced bill. This forces defendants to go out and cure problems for which they have been responsible. It also tells plaintiffs we would like them to mitigate damages; we would like them to figure out ways to hold down the cost; we should direct as much as we possibly can to alternative dispute systems. Picking up on the theme of Chairman MCCAIN, that is a bipartisan proposition. I think we have been responsive to key concerns that have been made by those with reservations about this bill. 
   There are some areas where we cannot go. I will emphasize as we move to today's debate a couple of those big concerns. We cannot allow under our legislation the creation of new Y2K torts that are not warranted on the basis of the facts. We believe, in areas like the economic loss issue which was debated so intensely yesterday, that the appropriate remedies involve State contract law. When consumers are faced with economic losses, we want to see them get a fair shake in this area, and we believe State contract law should govern. 
   What we are not able to do is allow those who believe State contract law is inadequate with respect to economic losses, we cannot support them repackaging those claims as new Y2K torts. We favor the status quo. With respect to economic losses, we want to see consumers protected in the right of contract. 
   However, this Member of the Senate thinks it would be a big mistake to create on the floor of the Senate today and in the days ahead new Y2K torts, new tort claims, that don't exist today under current law. 
   I am very hopeful that we are able to finish this legislation today. It is bipartisan legislation now as a result of the 11 changes that have been made. I am very hopeful the White House will not veto this legislation. I have said repeatedly that to veto a responsible bill is just like lobbing a monkey wrench into the technology engine that is driving the Nation's prosperity. That is what is going to be the real effect of vetoing a responsible bill in this area. 
   We continue to remain open to ideas and suggestions from colleagues. We want this bill signed. We have made, as I say, 11 major changes since this bill left the Senate Commerce Committee on a bipartisan basis under the leadership of Senator DODD, who is the Democratic leader on the Y2K issue. There are areas where we cannot go, such as the creation of new Y2K torts in this area. 
   I look forward to today's debate and am anxious to continue to work with colleagues in a bipartisan way. I am very optimistic that the bill the Senate hopefully will pass today will get the support of the White House. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I came over to the floor because I am in sympathy with what the Senator from California is trying to do. But this bill has taken such a pasting in the last 15 or 20 minutes that I am going to take a couple of minutes to correct the RECORD before we actually get into the merits of what my colleague is trying to do. 
   For example, I have heard repeatedly that if you pass this bipartisan legislation put together by the Senator from Arizona and the Democratic leader on technology issues, Senator DODD, and myself, well, these companies won't have to do anything; they won't have to do anything at all. 
   Well, if they don't do anything at all, they are going to get sued. That is what is going to happen to them. Then we heard that if they were big and bad, they were going to get a free ride. I heard that several times here on the floor of the Senate in the last 15 or 20 minutes. If you are big and bad, you are going to get a free ride if we pass this bill. I will tell you what happens if  you are big and if you engage in egregious activity, if you rip people off; what happens is you get stuck for punitive damages because there is absolutely no cap on those, and joint and several liability applies to those people as well. That is what happens to the people who are big and bad under our legislation. 
   I think it is just as important that the RECORD be corrected. I also heard that businesses were going to be the victims and the like. Well, if that is the case, it is sort of hard to understand why hundreds and hundreds of business organizations are supporting this bill. I would be very interested in somebody showing me a list of some business groups that aren't supporting the bill because I would sure want to be responsive to those folks. 
   Let me, if I might, talk specifically about the Boxer amendment. By the way, apart from the last 15 or 20 minutes of discussion, my friend from California has been very helpful on a lot of technology issues that this Senator has been involved in. I remember the Internet Tax Freedom Act that we worked on in the last session of the Congress, where the Senator from California was very helpful. I very much appreciated that. 
   The question that I have--and maybe I can engage in a discussion with the Senator from California on this and try to see if I can get fixed in my mind how to make what the Senator from California is talking about workable, because I think the Senator from California wants to do what is right. I am now just going to focus on her amendment and sort of put aside some of these other comments that I have heard in the last 15, 20 minutes, which I so vehemently take exception to, and see if I can figure out with the Senator from California how we can make this workable. I want to tell her exactly what my concerns are. I come from a consumer movement, and she comes from that movement, and I know what she is trying to do is the right thing. 
   Let us say that you have a system where one chip out of thousands is out of whack. My colleague says it ought to be repaired or replaced, and the question that we have heard as we have tried to talk to people is: Does this mean replacing just a chip? Does it mean replacing the operating system? Who is responsible for the fix? Is it Circuit City, where you bought it? Is it Compaq Computer? Is it the chip maker? 
   What we have found in our discussions with people is that it wasn't just chips, but it was the software situation as well. Is it going to be Lotus or Novell or the retired computer programmer who put the code together a few years ago? As far as I can tell, the responsible companies--and I think the Senator from California has been absolutely right in making the point that there are an awful lot of responsible people out there. We are trying to do the right thing. The responsible people seem to want to do the kinds of things that the Senator from California is talking about. I know I saw an EDS advertisement essentially in support of our bill that talked about how they have a system to try to do this. 
   If we can figure out a way, with the Senator from California, to do the kinds of things she is talking about so as to not again produce more litigation at a time when we are trying to constrict litigation, I want to do it. 
   I have already had my staff put a lot of time into this. We are willing to spend a lot more time, because I think the motivations of the Senator from California are absolutely right. The question is how to deal with the kinds of bits, bytes, and chips, and all of the various technological aspects that go into this. 
   I would be happy to yield to my colleague and hear her thoughts on it.

   Mr. WYDEN. My colleague is constructive, as always. Here is the kind of concern I think the high-technology sector would have to focus on the manufacturer. That deals with this issue of interoperability where, in effect, if you have one system or product that is Y2K compliant but, as a result of it being installed in a system that isn't already Y2K ready, you may have in fact failures, or bugs, or defects, the Y2K-ready product may get infected and not properly function. Then the question is, Who is responsible? Can you, in effect, have somebody take responsibility for fixing a problem that isn't under their control? 
   If the Senator from California would like to put in a quorum call and get into the issue of interoperability and how to deal with these various issues, and sort of have all of the people talking at once, I think that is very constructive. I am anxious to do it. 
   I think this is a discrete and important concept. Again, without going back to all the things that were said in the last 20 or 25 minutes, if you are a consumer, or a business, and you are getting stiffed, you can go out and sue immediately. You can go out and sue and get an injunction immediately. You don't have to wait 30 or 60 days, or whatever. You can go immediately. 
   I would like to spend the time during the quorum call to try to focus on what I think is a very sincere effort of the Senator from California to try to do something to help people who need a remedy, and need it quickly. We are going to have to get into some of these interoperability questions and some of the questions of what happens when you have a problem that essentially gets into your system after it leaves your hands. I am anxious to try to do it. We can put it in the context of the kind of discrete, specific idea that the Senator from California was talking about rather than what I heard during the last 20 or 25 minutes about how big and bad actors are going to get a free ride, when in fact on page 13 of the bill it says that you are liable for the problem that you cause. That is what is on page 13 of the bill. Proportionate liability--you are liable for the portion of the problem you caused. If you engage in intentional misconduct, if you rip people off, you are going to be stuck for the whole thing--joint and several, punitive damages, the works. 
   I would prefer to do what the Senator from California is now suggesting,  which is to put in a quorum call, bring the good people from Chairman MCCAIN's office and from the office of the Senator from California and myself, along with Senator DODD's, into a discussion to see if we can figure out a way to make this workable. 
   I am happy to yield the floor.

   Mr. WYDEN. We are going to have to look at some of these. 
   The question is, Is a fix available? If we are not careful, that could be a lawyer's full employment program. 
   My colleague is absolutely right. In Oregon and California, we have access to some of the best minds and most dedicated and thoughtful people on the planet in this area. We should spend some time making sure we can get at this concept the Senator from California wishes to address in a workable way so we don't have more litigation, rather than less. I know the Senator from California shares that goal. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. WYDEN. I thank the Chair. 
   Mr. President, I am going to be brief this morning. I know my colleague from Colorado has been waiting. The Democratic leader of the Y2K effort, Senator DODD, has also been waiting. I will be brief to begin. 
   It is just a couple of hundred days to the new millennium. It seems to this Member of the Senate that how this body handles this legislation will say a great deal about our Nation's ability to keep our strong technology-oriented economy prospering in the next century. 
   I believe that failure to pass this responsible legislation would be like sticking a monkey wrench in the high-tech engine that is driving our economic prosperity. There is no question that there are going to be problems early next year stemming from the Y2K matter. What is going to happen, however, is that the frivolous lawsuits will compound those problems. 
   The sponsors of this legislation--the chairman of the committee, the Democratic leader of the Y2K effort, Senator DODD, and myself and others who have been intensively involved--believe that with this bill our Nation will be in a better position to be on line rather than waiting in line for a courtroom date when the problems occur. 
   We have heard my chairman, Senator HOLLINGS, and others talk about the matter of changing jurisprudence in our country. Senator HOLLINGS specifically, who I respect so much, talked about how 200 years of case law and jurisprudence is being changed. 
   This is a very narrow bill. Senator DODD and I insisted that there be a sunset date on this legislation. We believe,  and all the evidence points to the fact, that we are going to 
   see the problems stemming from Y2K trailing off 1 to 3 years into the new century. We have put a tight 36-month sunset date on this legislation. 
   This is not changing Anglo-American jurisprudence for all time. This is a narrow bill that will apply for 36 months so that we do not have to have, for example, a special session of the Senate early next year to deal with this problem.

   Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I will be anxious to yield to my colleague from Massachusetts after I have had a chance for just a few minutes of discussion of this issue. 
   I will take a minute and outline an example of the kind of issue that we are going to see early next century and how this legislation specifically responds to it. 
   Let's say that Mabel's restaurant buys $10,000 worth of computers from the Jones Company and they crash on January 3 of next year. Mabel's restaurant loses a million dollars' worth of business as a result. Mabel writes to Jones Computer Company telling them that the crash was as a result of a Y2K failure; they want the computers fixed, she wants compensation for the million dollars. 
   Here is what happens: The Jones Computer Company has to respond within 30 days of hearing from Mabel's restaurant. They can say: Yes, Y2K failure; we are going to fix the computer the way Mabel wants, and we are going to pay the million dollars as well. Or they can say: We will fix the Y2K problem, but we don't think we ought to be responsible for the entire million dollars' loss. Mabel and Jones Computer agree Jones ought to fix them, they negotiate and come up with what Jones is liable for, and if Mabel doesn't think she is getting everything she ought to, she can go out and sue Jones immediately. Or she can say the situation isn't fixed the way she wants it and she can go out and again file a lawsuit immediately. 
   Now, some have said, well, what happens if the Jones Computer Company is bankrupt and insolvent? Well, Mabel can name in her lawsuit anybody she thinks is a responsible party. The jury will then decide what portion of the blame each potential defendant ought to bear. Virtually all of these cases are going to be decided on the basis of existing State contract and tort law. We lock into this legislation protection for existing contracts, and in virtually all of the cases State contract and tort law is going to be protected. 
   So what you are going to have is a situation where Mabel's restaurant, if it isn't fixed to her satisfaction, can go to 
   court essentially immediately and recover all of her economic damages. She is in a position, by the way, to recover up to a quarter of a million dollars in punitive damages. I made my career with the Gray Panthers, the senior citizens group, before I came to Congress and now for 18 years in Congress, around consumer advocacy. It seems to me that is a pretty good deal, what I have outlined in this hypothetical case for this restaurant, for just about any consumer in our country. 
   I want to talk specifically about whether Americans are losing any legal rights in this particular legislation. I guess we could say they are losing the right to sue for a few days. As I said, they can sue immediately if they choose to. But the reason we are trying to have that 30-day period for defendants is to make sure they fix people's problems. It is better to be on line than waiting in line for that court date. 
   Second, I guess you can say the cap on punitive damages as it relates to small business means we are not going to stick it to small business. Well, I happen to think those small businesses are making an extraordinary contribution to our economy. So let's have a philosophical debate. The Senator from Massachusetts, who has worked hard on this issue, and I have a difference of opinion on that. We don't disagree on a whole lot of issues. I think we do disagree on that one. But I think we ought to protect the small businesses from these unlimited punitive damages. 
   Third, I guess you can say our legislation does make some changes with respect to joint and several liability. What we are saying, however, is that anytime you have a corporate defendant who engages in egregious conduct, rips off consumers, is guilty of fraud, joint and several liability applies in those kinds of instances. It also applies when we have individuals with a low net worth as well. 
   I would like the Senate to also reflect on the fact that essentially what we are doing here is what we did in the Securities Litigation Reform Act. It parallels most of the key issues in that area. 
   I want to wrap up by just mentioning briefly all of the major changes that were made in this legislation after it left the Senate Commerce Committee where Democrats, in a united fashion, opposed the bill. 
   I mentioned the 3-year sunset provision. I want it understood by all Members of this body that I will be against any bill that comes out of the conference committee that doesn't have a sufficient sunset provision. This is not changing Anglo-American jurisprudence for all time; this is a 3-year bill. We insisted on it after it came out of the Commerce Committee. 
   Second, the business community originally talked about a vague Federal defense that would essentially give them protection if they engage in reasonable efforts. On the basis of what we heard from the consumer groups, the Democratic leader of the Y2K effort, Senator DODD, and I thought that was too vague, to give corporate defendants that kind of break. So we cut that out. 
   Third, we dropped the new preemptive Federal standard for establishing punitive damages. The only people we are protecting are the small business people. We may have a philosophical difference of opinion on that. We think those folks deserve protection. 
   On the question of joint and several liability, when it 
   came out of committee, even if you engaged in fraud, even if you had a low-net-worth defendant, there wasn't protection for the plaintiff. We insisted on those kinds of changes. We said if a corporate defendant engages in outrageous conduct, if they are trying to rip somebody off, you bet joint and several applies. Senator DODD and I insisted on that provision as well. 
   Also, a provision which is certainly not popular in the business community: There is liability for directors and officers if they make misleading statements or they withhold information regarding any actual or potential Y2K problems. 
   So at the end of the day, I believe we have a balanced bill. The defendants have an obligation under this legislation to go out and cure problems, to get their businesses online and make sure they are in a position so that this technology-driven economy can continue to hum as it has. The plaintiffs have equal obligations. They have a duty to mitigate. So there are obligations on the part of the defendants and obligations on the part of the plaintiffs. 
   But this is a narrow bill. It is going to discourage frivolous claims, but it is also going to make sure that those who have a legitimate, honest concern, as in that example of a small business I outlined here this morning, that that small business is going to be able to go after all of the parties, all of the parties responsible, and hold them liable for the portion of the problem to which they actually contribute. So I am very hopeful the Senate will pass this legislation. 
   We heard mention of the trial lawyers on the floor of the Senate earlier. Probably, prior to my involvement in this legislation, I was considered one of the better friends of those folks. Mention was made of the tobacco issue. I was the Member of Congress who got the tobacco executives under oath to say nicotine was addictive, which I think has had a little bit to do with helping to protect kids and consumers in this country. So I don't take a back seat to anybody in terms of standing up for consumer rights.  
   I say to the Senate today that as a result of months of difficult negotiations, led by the chairman of the Commerce Committee, Senator MCCAIN, the Democratic leader of the Y2K effort, Senator DODD, myself, Senator FEINSTEIN, and others, we have brought a balanced bill to the floor of the Senate. It is going to ensure that we do not throw a monkey wrench into this technology engine that is doing so much to ensure our prosperity.

   Just before I yield the floor, I, too, want to say to Senator HOLLINGS, the Democratic leader of the Commerce Committee, that I agree with so much of what he has done--whether it is a matter of Social Security surplus or campaign finance. I regret that on this one we have a difference of opinion. 
   I think that we have brought a balanced bill to the floor of the Senate. But I look forward to the many other issues on which Senator HOLLINGS and I are going to be in agreement.

   I think what the chairman of the Commerce Committee is suggesting is a practical way to get at it. This Member of the Senate believes, with all due respect to my friend from Massachusetts, that the Kerry amendment would be a lightning rod for additional frivolous lawsuits with respect to Y2K. I think, for example, some of the language is so vague--this question of identifying the potential for Y2K failure.

   Mr. WYDEN. As soon as I have made this point, because it is the chairman's time. 
   I think that is so vague that it is going to ignite a litigation derby. That is No. 1. 
   No. 2, we have had a kind of mixing of the concept of punitive damages and proportionality by the Senator from Massachusetts that I think is just not borne out by the bipartisan bill. Our punitive damage limitation applies only to small business. It has nothing to do with reckless behavior or careless behavior. 
   On proportionality, we are saying that you can hold everybody liable for exactly what they contribute, whether they are a small business or anything else. 
   Finally, on the example of the person, I believe it was Mrs. Barnes, and the chemical plant, she has all her existing remedies with respect to personal injury and wrongful conduct under negligence law. That is all outlined on page 10. 
   I appreciate the chairman of the Commerce Committee yielding me the time to briefly make a response to the Kerry amendment. As I say, I am a Senator who agrees with the Senator from Massachusetts on so many things. I do share his view that I hope by the time we are done with this legislation, we can have something that gets upwards of 70 votes. But suffice it to say, this Senator believes, with all due respect, the proposal of the Senator from Massachusetts will be a lightning rod for a variety of frivolous lawsuits. 
   I thank the chairman of the committee for yielding.

   It seems to me that on the basis of everything we have gone through in terms of the committee, there is a reason that the high-tech community is overwhelmingly opposed to the Kerry amendment. As far as I can tell, there is this company the Senator from Massachusetts has talked about, and I will acknowledge that. But the high-tech community, as far as I can tell, is overwhelmingly opposed to this Kerry amendment. As far as I can tell, the reason they are is that the Kerry amendment introduces vague, ill-defined terms that are going to trigger  more litigation. On the basis of everything we went through in the committee, is it the chairman's judgment that that is the reason the high-tech community is overwhelmingly opposed to the Kerry proposal now before the Senate?

   Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I will be very brief. I want to respond to the point the Senator from Massachusetts made with respect to the standard that he would apply in identifying the potential for Y2K failure. 
   I believe that using language that vague virtually ensures that a significant number of frivolous cases are going to end up going to juries--exactly what we fear. What will happen, companies will attempt to defend themselves, the judge will be offered a motion to dismiss, and the company will say: It is frivolous; we move to dismiss the case. The judge will look, and if this were the standard that were actually adopted, he would say: I don't know whether they identified the potential for Y2K failure. And we would, in fact, be igniting an additional round of frivolous lawsuits. 
   A motion to dismiss under this standard will get by because it is so vague. 
   With respect to the economic losses the Senator from Massachusetts has talked about and believes are inadequately addressed under our bipartisan legislation, in this bill we keep State contract and tort law in effect. We keep State contract and tort law in effect. The problem is that there are some who disagree, some who would essentially like to create torts out of these contractual rights where no torts exist. 
   Finally, with respect to punitive damages, the Senator from Massachusetts said again that our bipartisan bill would hollow out, for example, protections that are needed for consumers. We ensure our standard of evidence with respect to this is in line with State requirements. Again, we are trying to take a balanced approach. 
   I hope my colleagues will oppose the Kerry amendment. I think it ensures we will see a significant number of frivolous suits not being dismissed where they ought to be but essentially ending up going to juries and causing great economic duress early in the next century. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. WYDEN. Thank you, Mr. President. 
   I would like to take just a few minutes, as we wait for the minority leader to address some of the concerns that have been raised by the Senator from Massachusetts, to describe why I and the Democratic leader of the Y2K efforts, Senator DODD, believe that the Kerry amendment, though certainly sincere, is really a glidepath, an invitation, to frivolous lawsuits with respect to this Y2K matter. 
   I come today to say we know we are going to have problems early in the next century. That has been documented on a bipartisan basis by the Y2K committee. What we are concerned about is not compounding the problem with frivolous lawsuits. Regrettably, the KERRY proposal is going to do just that. 
   What the Senator from Connecticut and I have tried to do is to talk first about the vagueness of the language in the Kerry proposal. This notion that you would simply have to identify ``potential'' with respect to the Y2K issue and Y2K problems is just going to be a lawyers' full employment program. What is going to happen is, you are going to have frivolous cases brought; you will very quickly have companies, particularly small business defendants, move to dismiss those cases because they are patently frivolous. 
   Because the Kerry standard is so vague, a judge is going to have really no alternative other than to send that to a jury. So I think that provision, identifying ``potential,'' is a real lightning rod for frivolous lawsuits. That would be our first concern. 
   The second, it seems to me, is that the Senator from Massachusetts has, to a great extent, mixed together, commingled, the principles of punitive damages and proportionality. I would like to try to step back for a minute and see if I can clarify that. 
   The Senator from Massachusetts has spoken repeatedly, he has come to the floor repeatedly, and said that under the bipartisan legislation, if defendants are engaged in reckless, irresponsible, wanton conduct, there is going to be no remedy for the plaintiff in those situations. 
   The fact of the matter is, under proportionality--clearly laid out in our legislation--you are liable to the extent that you contributed to the problem. That is true if you are a small business, if you are one of the Fortune 500 businesses--it is true no matter who you are. Under our language, with respect to proportionality, you are liable for what you contribute. It is just that simple. 
   With respect to punitive damages, besides keeping in place the State evidentiary standards on punitive damages, what we in fact say is the only  people we are really going to try to protect are those who are such a key part of the technology engine for our country, and that is the Nation's small businesses. 
   Finally, colleagues, I think there is some confusion with respect to this issue of economic losses as well. The Senator from Massachusetts has said that in some way the bipartisan proposal we bring has narrowed the availability of coverage for economic losses. We very specifically, in our legislation, make clear that existing State contract and tort law is kept in place. 
   What the dispute is all about is that the Senator from Massachusetts, and perhaps others, is in effect trying to tortify existing contract law. 
   They would like to try to create some torts for 36 months in the Y2K area where those torts do not exist today in existing law. 
   My reputation, my background is as a consumer advocate. That is what I was doing with the Gray Panthers for 7 years before I was elected to the Congress, what I have tried to do for 18 years in both the House and the Senate. I feel very strongly about protecting consumers, and there are areas where it is appropriate to create new torts. Certainly, I have created a few causes of action during my years of service in the Congress. 
   If I can just finish, then I will be glad to yield to the Senator from Massachusetts. I think it would be a mistake, given the extraordinary potential for economic calamity in the next century, to change the law with respect to economic loss. We are neither broadening it nor narrowing it. We are keeping it in place. I know that those State laws with respect to economic loss do not do a lot of the things that the Senator from Massachusetts thinks are important, but that is, in fact, what we do in our legislation. 
   I want to be clear, our legislation does nothing, absolutely nothing, to limit remedies that are available to plaintiffs when, in fact, they are victims of a personal injury or wrongful death. So if an individual, early in January of the next century, is in an elevator, for example, and the computer in the elevator breaks, and the individual tragically falls to his or her death or suffers a grievous bodily injury, all existing tort law remedies apply in that kind of instance. 
   The bill that is before the Senate now is a very different one than the one that was voted on on a partisan basis by the Senate Commerce Committee. In fact, in the Senate Commerce Committee, I joined the Senator from Massachusetts in saying that it was wholly inadequate in terms of protecting the rights of consumers. I happen to think the bill the House of Representatives passed is wholly inadequate. 
   The legislation that we have now is a balanced bill. The defendants have strong obligations to cure defects. The plaintiffs have an obligation to mitigate damages. I think our failure to pass this bill, which has now included 10 major changes to favor consumers and plaintiffs since the time it left the Commerce Committee, our failure to pass this bill, I think, is a failure to meet our responsibilities as it relates to this technology engine that is driving so much of our Nation's prosperity. 
   I think when we look at the potential for calamity early in the next century, I don't think there is any dispute that we are going to have a significant number of problems. The question is, does the Senate want to compound those problems by triggering a round of unnecessary and frivolous litigation? 
   I hope we won't do that. I urge my colleagues to oppose the Kerry amendment. 
   I yield the floor. 
   Mr. KERRY addressed the Chair.

   I am saying that our proposal protects State contract law with respect to economic losses. It seems to me that the gentleman's proposal, in wanting to change existing State contract law, is clearly moving us in a different area which legal experts have come to describe, pretty arcanely, as the notion of tortifying contract law doctrine, yes.

   Mr. WYDEN. We apply State contract law to these economic losses. What we say is, you get your economic loss under 
   current law if your State law lets you. The Senator from Massachusetts is absolutely right. There is a sincere difference of opinion here. We are saying economic losses should be governed by State contract law. The Senator from Massachusetts says that he would like to go with a different concept. That is the difference of opinion here.

   Mr. WYDEN. I appreciate my colleague yielding. 
   This goes right to the heart of the debate. We essentially say that State contract law will govern in these jurisdictions. The Senator from Massachusetts believes in a variety of instances that there should be other remedies. He is creating other remedies during this 36-month period where we are trying to present frivolous lawsuits. 
   The key principle here and what is now being debated is that under what Senator MCCAIN, Senator BENNETT and Senator DODD, the leader on our side on the Y2K issue, have said, we are going to protect State contract law with respect to economic losses. But we don't feel it is appropriate to try to create new remedies at this time when we are trying to prevent these frivolous lawsuits. 
   I am very appreciative to the Senator from Utah for yielding to me. I hope our colleagues will see that on this point of economic loss, State contract law is fully protected.

   Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, on this point, Senator EDWARDS is such a magnificent lawyer and I am always reluctant to get into this, but the bottom line in this matter of economic losses is, whatever the plaintiff is entitled to get under State contract law with respect to economic losses is what our bill does. That is just the bottom line. Whatever the plaintiff is entitled to under State contract law is what they are going to get for economic loss--no more, no less. The bill keeps the status quo. 
   I want to take a minute to go to one example. I want to take a minute to talk about the options available to the typical small business in these kinds of cases. 
   Let's say we have a company that buys $10,000 worth of computers from another company, and they all crash January 3 of 2000. They lose $1 million worth of business as a result. Obviously, they are unhappy. They write the computer company and they say that crash was the fault of the computer company, the Y2K failure, and they want it fixed, and they want their money, they want their $1 million. I want to take a second and describe what happens in those situations. 
   The computer company has to get back to the small business within 30 days. It has to make it clear. You have to move. They can say it was a Y2K failure. The computer company says, ``It is our fault. We will fix it the way the business wants--the restaurant. We will give you $1 million.'' 
   That is that. They can say they will fix the Y2K problem, but they should not be responsible for the whole $1 million. They might say, ``We will fix it, but we have to negotiate this out. We are liable for some. You are liable for some.'' 
   If the small business isn't satisfied with what the computer company does, they can basically go out and sue immediately in that kind of situation. 
   The third kind of example would be, the computer company just stiffs the small businessperson, is completely unresponsive to what the small business needs. In that case, the plaintiff, the small businessperson, can go out and file a suit immediately against the computer company. 
   Finally, we have raised the example of what happens if that computer company is bankrupt and insolvent. At that point, the small businessperson can name in their lawsuit anybody they think is a responsible party. They can name Intel; they can name Microsoft; they can name anybody they want. It is at that point the jury is going to decide what portion of the blame each potential defendant ought to bear. 
   That strikes us as sensible. That is the principle of proportionality. We are saying that you ought to pick up the burden of the problem you actually produced, but if you did something intentional, if you ripped somebody off, if you engaged in egregious conduct, then joint and several applies. 
   If we are talking about a low net worth of a defendant, it is the same sort of situation. So the plaintiff isn't left hanging. 
   As we get towards the final vote, I ask my colleagues to remember that is what a typical small business is entitled to--those four kinds of situations, so that at the end of the day they are going to have their economic losses dealt with just as they would under State contract law--no more, no less. 
   Really, we have what amounts to only a handful of real protections for this 36-month period. Yes, we do say that if a small business is operating in good faith, we would put some limits on punitive damages. I guess there can be a philosophical difference of opinion on that. Reasonable people can differ. But we think that if a small business acts in good faith, there ought to be some limit in terms of these punitive damages. 
   There are only a handful of protections. 
   Again, the 30-day period is a limitation on somebody's right to sue. That is why we say if you really think you are stiffed, you can go out and sue immediately. We think it makes sense for a 30-day period to try to cure these problems. 
   On the proportionality issue, we are making a change to deal with a situation where we think that unless somebody engages in an egregious offense-type of conduct with a low net worth defendant, it is appropriate in this situation to say you are liable for what you actually produced. 
   In addition to this being a bill that lasts for a short period of time, it does not apply to personal injury problems at all. If somebody is in an elevator and the computer system falls out and the elevator drops 10 floors and somebody is badly injured, all existing tort remedies apply. 
   I am very hopeful we will have a significant number of our colleagues, particularly on the Democratic side of the aisle, supporting this. There have been 10 major changes made in this legislation since it left the Senate Commerce Committee. Our senior Democrat, the distinguished Senator from South Carolina, was absolutely right--the bill that came out of the Senate Commerce Committee was completely unacceptable in terms of the rights of consumers and the rights of plaintiffs. I joined him in opposing it. 
   Since that time, we took out the items that were unfair. A lot of them happened to be in the House bill--which is completely unacceptable to me, as well. 
   This bill is a balanced bill. It tells defendants they have to go out and cure problems; it tells plaintiffs they have to go out and mitigate damages. I hope our colleagues recognize that failure to pass a responsible bill in this area is just like hurling a monkey wrench into the technology engine that is keeping our economy humming. I hope we won't do that. 
   The Senator from North Carolina asked me, before I went through that enlightening example of small business, to yield. I am happy to do so.

   Mr. WYDEN. If the Senator will let me reclaim my time, I will read the precedence we are citing with respect to our opinion that our bill covers economic losses in line with State law and common law. 
   Let me read to the Senator the precedent:  
   The prevailing common law rule is that ``recovery of intangible economic losses is normally determined by contract law.''  
   That is Prosser, 1984. 
   Accordingly, the courts have essentially allowed plaintiffs to address these matters in State contract law by Clark v. Int'l Harvester Company, Chrysler v. Taylor, Inglis v. American Motor Company. 
   Our position is that the economic loss rule in our bill is merely an explicit recognition of this sensible principle, which is in line with the legal precedence I cited, and also Prosser.

   The Senator raised the question of whether or not plaintiffs ought to be able to circumvent the provisions of State contract law by repackaging suits as tort claims. That has not been allowed by the courts. 
   If the Senator is talking about something else, we are happy to look at this. What we have in our legal analysis, and I have cited the specific cases that back up our particular point, is an indication that we believe we are protecting plaintiffs and plaintiffs' rights to recover in line with State contract law on economic losses.

   If the Senator can show me something in the 2 1/2 pages that he is so alarmed about--he has referred to the 2 1/2 pages now three or four times--if the Senator can show me something in those 2 1/2 pages that indicates that a plaintiff could not recover through their State contract law economic losses, I guarantee myself, Senator DODD, and Senator MCCAIN are interested in working with the Senator on it. 
   We cannot find anything. We have precedence and we have a legal analysis that backs up our point of view. If the Senator finds something in those 2 1/2 pages that the Senator thinks indicates that a plaintiff cannot recover their economic losses according to State contract law, we will be very open to seeing it.

   Mr. WYDEN. If I could refer the distinguished Senator from South Carolina to the specific section, I have been talking about section 11, contractual damages. I gather the Senator from North Carolina, who is getting us into this area, was largely talking about the tort section. That, of course, is the difference of opinion here. I believe it would be a mistake to try to ``tortify'' these contractual rights at this time when we are staring, early in the next century, at all of these liabilities. 
   I have three good friends with whom I agree on probably the vast majority of issues that come up in this body who see it otherwise. I recognize that. But I want to, again, in the name of trying to work things out, make it clear if there is anything in the contract section--in the contract section--that would suggest a plaintiff cannot get the economic losses they are entitled to under State contract law, I am very certain Senator MCCAIN and Senator DODD and I will be happy to look at that. We do have a difference of opinion on this matter involving torts.

   Mr. WYDEN. No. Not at all. In fact, let me again read from our legal analysis:  
   The economic loss rule is a widely recognized legal principle that has been adopted by the United States Supreme Court in the vast majority of States. It states a party who has suffered only economic damages must generally sue to recover those damages under contract law, not under tort law. Tort law generally applies only where a party has suffered personal injury or damages to property other than the property in dispute.  
   So we are having, I guess, a duel of legal analyses. But we are happy to share ours. We believe, again, the court precedents and the specific analysis I am citing make it very clear that recovery that is available today for economic losses under State contract law is not being altered in any way by this bill.

   Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation, along with Congressman WALDEN in the House of Representatives, that would fight the scourge of negative political campaigns with the simple yet powerful tool of accountability. If candidates choose to run for office by disparaging their opponents rather than standing on their own records and beliefs, they should at least be expected to take responsibility for the ad campaigns that they run. Under this legislation, there would be meaningful financial penalty--in the form of higher advertising rates--for those who fail to do so. 
   For me, this bill arises out of unpleasant personal experience. I was elected to this body in a special election against the man I am now proud to call my friend and colleague, GORDON SMITH. That campaign was the nastiest, most negative, least edifying political season that my state has ever been through. The unabashedly negative ads that both of our campaigns put on the air were a sour departure from Oregon's tradition of responsible, thoughtful politics. 
   I eventually became so disgusted with what my own campaign had become, that with only a few weeks before the election, I got rid of all my ads, destroyed negative mailings that were about to be sent out, asked others who were airing negative ads on my behalf to desist, and started over with a campaign that was 100 percent positive. I didn't know if it would be a smart campaign strategy or a kind of political suicide, and I didn't much care. Win or lose, I wanted to be proud of the way that I had conducted myself. 
   What I learned all too well in that campaign is that negative politics corrupts everything that it touches. It harms not only its target, but its sponsor as well. Negative ads are one of the biggest reasons for the cynicism and even disgust that so many Americans feel toward the political process. They cheapen the very institution of democracy. 
   There's no way, of course, to mandate a sense of shame or legislate an end to negative ads. But in an era when elections are determined more and more by television and radio advertising, it is not too much to ask that candidates be held responsible for the statements they make in their ads. 
   Under current campaign law, broadcasters are required to give qualified candidates for federal office their lowest price for ads, what is known as the lowest unit broadcast rate. In order to qualify for this rate, candidates must comply with federal campaign finance laws, and include proper disclaimers in the ad, among other regulations. The Political Candidate Personal Responsibility Act would attach two additional requirements to the discounted ad rate. The first requirement is that for both television and radio advertisements, the lowest unit rate will only be available if a candidate, when referring to his or her opponent, makes the reference him or her self. Radio advertisements must also contain a statement by the candidate in which the candidate identifies him or herself and the office for which the person is running. The second requirement is that in any television or radio ad where a candidate makes reference to his or her opponent, the candidate must appear or be heard for at least 75 percent of the broadcast time. If a candidate chooses to air an advertisement that does not comply with these requirements, he or she will be ineligible to receive the lowest unit rate for a period of 45 days in a primary and 60 days in a general election. 
   In other words, if you want the benefits of discounted broadcast time, you can't make disparaging statements that you aren't willing to say yourself. No more hiding behind grainy photographs, ominous music, and anonymous announcers. 
   Ultimately, one of our greatest responsibilities as elected officials is to encourage greater public participation in all levels of the political process. Campaign activities should not only represent the views of the candidates, but they should also encourage voters to participate in the democratic process. The growing negative trend of campaign advertisements degrades the process and discourages people from becoming involved.

   Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, as the Senate prepares for a Tuesday cloture vote on the Y2K litigation reform legislation, I want to spend just a few minutes this afternoon trying to describe where I believe we are in the course of the Senate debate and all the bipartisan progress that has been made in the last few weeks on this issue. I especially emphasize the bipartisan focus that has been taking place in the Senate. 
   The House had a vote, as the Presiding Officer knows, this week. Regrettably, it was pretty much along partisan lines. There is certainly nothing partisan about this issue. If we have chaos early in the next century as a result of Y2K frivolous lawsuits, folks are not going to be sitting around asking whether Democrats or Republicans caused it. They are going to be saying: What was the problem? Why didn't the Congress deal with it? 
   Fortunately, the Senate, unlike the House, has been working in a bipartisan way to deal with this. On the Republican side, Chairman MCCAIN and Chairman HATCH, Senator GORTON, Senator BENNETT, and a variety of Senators have worked with me and Senator DODD, who is the Democratic leader on this issue and has done such a good job on the Y2K committee. And Senator FEINSTEIN has made enormous contributions. She represents California, of course, a State that has a great interest in technology issues. 
   The most important thing, as the Senate goes to the important Y2K debate next week, is for all of us to recognize that we have taken a completely different approach from that of the House of Representatives. There was no evidence of bipartisanship in the House last week. That has not been the case in the Senate. 
   I also want to make it clear, both Senate Democrats and Republicans are interested in working with the White House on this legislation. For the White House to veto a responsible Y2K bill would be like throwing a monkey wrench into the technology engine that is driving this Nation's economic prosperity. 
   I cannot believe the White House would want to do that. I know there are many in the White House who have ideas and suggestions and are talking to Senators of both parties. We are anxious to hear from them, because the Senate is going to move next week to this debate and now is the time for them to come forward with their practical suggestions. 
   As the Presiding Officer knows, this is a topic that cannot wait. There are a variety of issues before the Senate where the immediacy may not be all that crucial. This is an issue that cannot wait, because if we do not deal with it now, I personally believe what will happen is, early in the next century we really will have chaos as a result of this Y2K situation. The Senate could find itself back in a special session at that time having to deal with it. It is much better to do it now and to do it in a bipartisan way. 
   I want to spend a few minutes talking about how this effort to make this issue bipartisan and ensure that it is fair to both consumers and business has evolved over the last few weeks. 
   The legislation that is coming before the Senate early next week is the legislation that began in the Senate Commerce Committee, led in that effort by Chairman MCCAIN and Senator GORTON. Unfortunately, there was a strict party-line vote in the Senate Commerce Committee. I and others said there were a whole lot of features of that original Senate Commerce bill that were just unacceptable to us. 
   For example, it included language that would have provided what is called a ``reasonable effort'' sort of defense which just was not fair to the plaintiff and to the consumer, 
   and I and others said that we could not support the bill at that time. 
   But after it came out of the Senate Commerce Committee, Chairman MCCAIN, to his credit, with other leaders on the Republican side of the aisle, made it clear that they wanted to work with Senator DODD, Senator FEINSTEIN, Senator KERRY, myself, and others to fashion a truly bipartisan bill. I believe that is what the Senate has before it now. 
   For example, the legislation which is coming before the Senate on Tuesday, which we will vote on Tuesday morning, has a sunset provision in it. We have heard all this talk on the floor of the Senate about how Y2K litigation legislation is going to be changing the tort laws and our legal system for all time, that it is going to be making these changes that are just going to last for time immemorial. 
   The fact of the matter is, the Y2K legislation sunsets in 2003. It is for a short period of time, and for a period of time to deal with what we think will otherwise be a variety of frivolous lawsuits and unnecessary litigation. 
   Second, the legislation which will be before the Senate early next week does absolutely nothing to change the tort remedies that consumers would have if they were injured as a result of a Y2K-related problem. 
   For example, if an individual is in an elevator that falls as a result of a computer failure, and tragically falls, say, 10 floors in an office building, and that individual is badly injured or killed, in that instance all of the existing legal remedies, all of the existing tort remedies that are now on the books, would still apply. The legislation before the Senate now would not touch in any way, not in any way, those remedies for personal injuries that would come about as a result of a Y2K failure. 
   So those two consumer protections--the sunset provision and ensuring that tort remedies are available to injured consumers--are in place and there to protect the public, and it is important that the Senate know that as we go to the upcoming Tuesday vote.  
   Third, the legislation which is before the Senate now eliminates the new and vague Federal defense, ``reasonable efforts,'' which was what was in the original Commerce Committee legislation. We think that was simply too mushy, too vague. It has been eliminated. 
   Fourth, after the legislation left the Commerce Committee, there were concerns about a new preemptive Federal standard for establishing punitive damages. Now, under the legislation before the Senate, the current standards as set out in our various States are going to prevail. 
   Fourth, after the legislation left the committee, we restored punitive damages in the most important cases. If a defendant is acting in bad faith, is engaged in egregious conduct that is offensive to consumers, all of the opportunities for punitive damages will lie. Also, if the defendant is insolvent, there will be a chance for the plaintiff to be made whole in those kinds of instances as well. 
   So the principle of joint liability for defendants in these key areas is in fact kept in place. 
   Next, we restore liability for directors and officers when they make misleading statements and withhold information regarding any actual or potential Y2K problem. 
   So all of that was essentially in the changes which Senator 
   MCCAIN and I brought to the Senate several weeks ago. We thought that that showed a good-faith effort to work with all sides, to work with the technology community, to work with consumer organizations. We consulted with the organizations representing trial lawyers. We thought it reflected a good balance. 
   After that effort, Senator DODD, the Democratic leader on the Y2K issue, presented a number of other very, very good suggestions, and those have been added as well. 
   So the Senate now has a Y2K reform bill in front of it where there have been 10 major changes made since this legislation left the Commerce Committee, changes that Senator MCCAIN and I agreed to, that we thought did the job. Senator DODD came forward with some other additional and excellent changes. And Senator MCCAIN, to his credit and effort to be bipartisan, accepted those as well. 
   So we have now, I think, addressed what has been the original concern of a number of Senators. We keep in place, for example, the States' standards with respect to evidence in these cases. There was a concern by some Senators that somehow this legislation had raised the bar in terms of the plaintiff having to meet higher standards of evidence in order to make their case. We kept the current State evidentiary standards. 
   So now in fact our standards with respect to evidence track the language in the securities litigation reform bill that was passed and signed into law as well as the 1992 Y2K Information Readiness Disclosure Act. So it is clear that there is precedent for the evidentiary standards we are using in this legislation. 
   These are major changes. They were put together by a bipartisan group and together, I think, reflect the kind of legislation that the Senate ought to pass and I think will pass when we get an opportunity to vote on the legislation on the merits. 
   I will also tell you that this makes the Senate bill a very, very different bill from the legislation the House of Representatives enacted a few days ago. The House legislation in fact had a vague reasonable-efforts defense. We got rid of that after it came out of the Senate Commerce Committee. Senator MCCAIN and I and Senator FEINSTEIN and others looked at the legislation. We got rid of that. We said it is too vague, it is not fair to the plaintiff or the consumer. The House kept it earlier in the week. 
   The House legislation did not have a sunset date in it. Our legislation does. It says this is going to be for a short time window, until 2003. 
   A number of other changes which we think are not fair to the plaintiff or the consumer were areas that the House was unwilling to touch. On the directors and officers, they do not take the position that we take. They would limit liability for directors and officers. They do not take the position that we take on proportionate liability. And in fact they do have a higher evidentiary standard for the plaintiff and the consumer than we do. 
   So the fact is, the Senate will be voting on a very, very different bill. I am hopeful that the Senate will strongly endorse our approach, which we think is fair to both plaintiffs and defendants. 
   There have been other ideas floated in the last couple of days. I will wrap up just for 
   a few minutes by talking about them, because I think if you look at what is being floated now, our legislation again falls right into the balanced, centrist kind of approach the Senate ought to be taking. I am going to wrap up just by briefly discussing some of these other ideas which have been circulated in the last couple of days. 
   There are some who would like to limit the legislation only to commercial laws. This would deny the consumer the chance to get a Y2K problem fixed in a timely manner. That is what we do in our legislation. But some who would limit the legislation only to commercial laws would force those who are least able to afford attorneys to go out and have to hire them. Under our bill, the consumer tells the manufacturer or the vendor how they want the problem fixed and they would be able to get the job done in 90 days or less. 
   I do not think the consumer wants to spend months and even years waiting in line after all the other frivolous lawsuits go forward before theirs. I think people want to get their problems solved and want to get them solved quickly. The fact is, under our legislation, if the consumer, if the plaintiff, is not treated fairly, if the consumers do not believe they get a fair shake, they can go out and file suit on the very first day--the very first day--and be in a position to have their issue aired immediately. 
   Some of the other proposals that have been offered would offer no protection for small business from punitive damages. Without some protection, a small business could be facing an avalanche of lawsuits. Putting a small business out of business is, in my view, an odd way to try to fix the Y2K problem. But what Senator DODD did, with the valuable additions that he made, was the kind of approach that I think really does protect the small business and deal with the issue of small businesses and punitive damages responsibly. Unlimited joint liability, and we have heard some who have advocated that, would declare open season on anybody in the wholesale or in the retail chain. You do that, and there is absolutely no protection for the small business mainstream retailer. 
   Now, what has been interesting is that some who have opposed the efforts that our bipartisan group has made on the Y2K issue have said that we are against small business and that small business does not get a fair shake under our legislation. 
   The fact of the matter is that hundreds of small business organizations have endorsed the bipartisan legislation that is before the Senate. I think the idea of having unlimited joint liability really would be inequitable to the small business. Certainly, we ought to make sure those small businesses that are most vulnerable get a fair shake. 
   Other approaches just do not offer the incentives to business that we think are necessary to help fix the Y2K problem. They just force the consumer into the courtroom, really give businesses no reason to help mitigate the Y2K situation. 
   This isn't a partisan issue. It affects every computer system that uses date information. Every piece of hardware, 
   every piece of an operating support system, and every software program that uses date-related information may be affected. It is not a design flaw. 
   There has somehow been spread across the country the notion that all of this stems from design flaws in our computer systems. It was an engineering trade-off. To get more space on a disk and in memory, the precision of century indicators was abandoned. It is hard for all of us to believe today that disk and memory space used to be at a premium, but it was. In the early 1960s, for example, computer memory cost as much as $1 million for what today can be purchased for less than $100. No computer programmer thought that the programs written then would still be running in the year 2000, but they are.  
   The trade-off became the industry standard, and computers cannot work at all without industry standards. Those standards are the means by which programs and systems exchange information. 
   I guess you could try to solve the Y2K problem by just dumping all the old layers of computer code that have been accumulated in the last few decades, but that is not a realistic way to proceed. Everybody involved, from CEOs to all of the people doing basic programming, need to continue the painstaking process of making sure that all systems are Y2K compliant. Our goal ought to be to bring every information technology system into Y2K compliance as soon as possible. That ought to be our principal focus and, at the same time, we ought to make sure, as our legislation does, that there is a good safety net in place. 
   I am very hopeful that the Senate will pass this legislation. We all know that the economic good times that we have seen recently are being driven by technology. I have said repeatedly that if there is a veto of a bipartisan, responsible Y2K bill, that really would be like throwing a monkey wrench into the technology engine that is driving our Nation's prosperity. There is no other way to put it. We have to get a good bipartisan Y2K reform bill on the President's desk. We need to do it now. 
   I am hopeful that the White House will work with us constructively in the days ahead. I think the changes that have been made since this legislation originally came out of the Senate Commerce Committee do the job. I can tell you, having heard from Senator MCCAIN and Senator HATCH and Senator DODD and Senator FEINSTEIN, we are open to other ideas and suggestions as well. But we have to get this legislation moving. We have to get it signed. It is too important. 
   I hope our colleagues get a little bit of R&R over the weekend. This has been a long week with the juvenile justice legislation. That bill and Y2K and other subjects are coming up next week, which will be hectic as well. I am very hopeful our colleagues will support the bipartisan Y2K bill that we will have before us Tuesday at 9:45. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I turn for a few minutes this morning to an issue that many Senators may not have heard much about but one that has great implications for the consumer, for intellectual freedom and the quality of life in our communities across the country. 
   The issue I intend to focus on specifically is the proposed acquisition by Barnes & Noble of the Ingram book company. The price tag on this acquisition is $600 million, and it involves the Nation's largest bookstore chain, Barnes & Noble, joining forces with the Ingram book company, the world's largest book distributor. 
   I am concerned that this deal will give Barnes & Noble a competitive stranglehold on the bookselling business in America. That is why last November I asked the Federal Trade Commission to investigate this proposed acquisition. Based on information I have learned in the last few days, I believe the Federal Trade Commission will soon make a decision on this proposed acquisition. I am very hopeful that when the Federal Trade Commission comes down with that decision, they will come down foursquare for the consumer. 
   Right now across this country, thousands and thousands of Americans have stopped at small bookstores to sign petitions urging that this proposed acquisition be blocked. In fact, there is a special phone line at the Federal Trade Commission because there has been such a tidal wave of interest on this specific proposal. I will briefly outline this morning what I find troubling about this proposed deal. 
   For a small bookstore, if this acquisition goes forward, they will have to depend on a megastore for the products they 
   sell. The new bookstore colossus, with Barnes & Noble coming together with Ingram, will essentially have a huge competitive advantage that could work to cause great hardship for small bookstores in our country. Because the Ingram Company has information about sales and volume and ordering habits of small bookstores, is the new megastore going to use that information in a fair way? I am very concerned about it, but I can tell you that small bookstores across this country are very troubled when it comes to getting fair access to the titles they need, when it comes to how that information which Ingram has, that will be part of the new operation with Barnes & Noble, is used. I can tell you that small bookstores across this country believe this issue is literally one of life and death for them. 
   Second, I am concerned about issues relating to intellectual freedom. My concern is that with this deal and the potential that there will be just a handful of big bookstores in our country dominating the Nation, what they will stock are largely the best sellers. 
   I have had some experience with this. My father, who passed away, was an author and had a small publishing company. He said there is always room at the big stores in titles involving sex and drugs and rock and roll. 
   But I am concerned about what is going to happen when we have just a handful of these megastores, whether we are going to see intellectual freedom prosper and those titles that are not always on the best seller list accessible the way they are today.  
   Third, I am concerned about the vitality of our communities. These small bookstores in so many of our communities do more than just sell books. Yes, they sell publications and they make it possible for young people in rural America and inner cities and others to have a comfortable place to learn, but they are also a huge addition to Main Street in so many parts of rural Oregon and, I am sure, in Kansas where the Presiding Officer resides. Having been born in Wichita, we have talked before about life in rural America. 
   I do not want to see those small bookstores becoming part of the Main Street of yesteryear in rural America. 
   I am very concerned that if this proposed merger goes forward, as it is currently structured, it really will put a hardship on a lot of main streets in rural communities and will diminish the vitality of many of those towns. 
   I admit to growing up a bit skeptical of some of these large megastores. As I said, my dad was an author, and I spent a lot of Sunday afternoons going through some of those megastores with my dad trying to persuade them to put one of his titles that did not fit their view of what was popular up close, up close to where the consumers were when they stopped to browse in the window. My father was concerned about the concentration of economic power in the bookselling business. 
   I tell you, I think this deal, if it goes forward as structured, will confirm a lot of the worries that my dad and others like him have had about our country and where the bookselling business is going. 
   Finally, I think we all understand that the bookselling business has changed certainly on the Internet. The Presiding Officer has worked with me on legislation which has been important to me such as the Internet Tax Freedom Act. 
   The Internet has changed the bookselling business. There is no question about the fact that with Amazon.com and others in the business of selling books on line, the business has changed very dramatically. But I do not buy the idea that Barnes & Noble had to merge with Ingram in order to take on Amazon. I do not buy that idea at all. 
   I think there is a role in our country for a variety of ways for consumers to order publications. I think there is an important place for the small bookstore, especially because of the contributions they make to main streets in rural communities and inner cities. I certainly do not want to hold back on-line shopping. That is why I was a principal sponsor in the Senate of the Internet Tax Freedom Act. So I do not take a back seat to anybody in terms of trying to ensure that we take advantage of all the technological innovations that are available for the consumer. 
   What concerns me about this proposal is that a lot of small bookstores are not going to be able to survive. A lot of small bookstores are going to find it difficult to survive if Barnes & Noble has proprietary information about them, about their volume, about their sales practices, about the way they do business, and if that information is used against small bookstores. 
   So I believe the Federal Trade Commission has in front of it an issue of extreme importance, one which will dramatically affect intellectual freedom, one which has great implications for antitrust policy and the consumer, one which will be vital to the well-being of communities and main streets across this country. I believe the Federal Trade Commission is going to rule soon on this proposed acquisition. I believe they are going to act in the interest of the consumer. I appreciate the opportunity to bring the Senate up to date on this important economic matter. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. WYDEN. I thank the Chair. 
   To begin the hour of debate that we have on the Y2K measure, I would like to discuss the agreement entered into late yesterday, the special effort that was led by Senator DODD of Connecticut. Senator DODD has been the leader on our side on the Y2K issue. The agreement that was entered into last night involved Senator MCCAIN, myself, Chairman HATCH, Senator FEINSTEIN, Chairman BENNETT; a number of colleagues were involved. It seems to me that this effort, which was led by Senator DODD, has directly responded to a number of the concerns outlined by the White House in the statement that was delivered yesterday to the Senate. I would like to briefly outline the proposals which are going to be offered by the Senator from Connecticut in conjunction with the group of us that has been working on a bipartisan basis for this legislation.  
   Under the changes made yesterday, there would be punitive damage caps for small businesses. We ensure that there is fairness to both sides. We would eliminate punitive damage caps for the large businesses, those over 50 employees. We would protect municipalities and governmental entities from punitive damages. And we would also ensure that State evidentiary standards for claims involving fraud were kept in place. 
   The legislation would continue to do the following. There would have to be a 30-day notice. The plaintiff would have to submit a 30-day notice to the defendant on the plaintiff's intentions to sue, with a description of the Y2K problem. If the defendant responded with a plan to remediate, then an additional 60 days would be allowed to resolve the problem. If the defendant didn't agree to fix the problem, the plaintiff would be in a position to sue on the 31st day. We would establish--and this was of great concern to a number of Members of the Senate--liability proportionality. We would ensure that defendants don't pay more than the damage they are responsible for but exceptions would include plaintiffs with a modest net worth who were not able to collect from one or more defendants and defendants who had intentionally injured plaintiffs. 
   I think this is especially important because, clearly, if you have a defendant who has engaged in intentionally abusive conduct, you want to send the strongest possible message, and we do establish liability proportionality under the agreement led by Senator DODD. 
   We would also preserve contract rights so as to not interfere with parties who have already agreed on Y2K terms and conditions. We would also confirm the duty to mitigate. This is an effort to essentially confirm existing law that plaintiffs have to limit damages and can't collect damages that could have been avoided. This is an opportunity for potential defendants to provide widespread information on Y2K solutions to assist potential plaintiffs. 
   Finally, our proposal would encourage alternative dispute resolution, and it also keeps, as a number of Democrats have discussed with us, all personal injury and wrongful death claims with every opportunity to use existing law to ensure protection for the consumer and for injured parties. 
   I commend my colleague from Connecticut, Senator DODD. He is the Democratic leader on the Y2K issue. Let me also say that what Senator DODD has done, in conjunction with myself and Senator MCCAIN, is he has essentially taken a lot of what we have done in the securities litigation area, a lot of what we have done in the earlier Y2K legislation, and used that as a model. So Senator DODD's proposal, in my view, is very constructive. We now have an agreement that has been entered into by Senator DODD, Chairman MCCAIN, myself, Chairman HATCH, who has been exceptionally helpful on this effort, our colleague from California, Senator FEINSTEIN, and Senator BENNETT, who chairs the Y2K committee. 
   So I am very pleased about this effort that was entered into late yesterday. I say to my colleagues--especially Democrats who were concerned about the statement issued earlier by the White House--this compromise effort that I have outlined--and we also issued a statement on it--responds directly to a number of the concerns that were outlined by the White House, especially the two perhaps most important, which are protection for injured parties as it relates to the opportunity to seek punitive damages where appropriate, and also to ensure that with respect to evidentiary standards, no one could say that this was now raising somehow for all time a change through Federal law. We specifically preserve State evidentiary standards for important claims involving fraud. 
   But I would say, Mr. President and colleagues, this legislation is not going to be a change for all time in our laws. It is essentially a bill, and it has a strong sunset provision that is going to last for 3 years or so. We are trying to make sure, through that sunset provision, that we deal just with those concerns raised by Y2K. Y2K is not a partisan issue. It affects every computer system that uses date information. It was essentially an engineering tradeoff which brought us to this predicament; to get more space on a disk and in memory, the idea of century indicators was abandoned. It is hard for us to believe today that disk and memory space at a premium, but it was at one time. So in an effort to try to make sure during those earlier days there were standards by which programs and systems could exchange information, there was this engineering tradeoff. 
   Now, some say you could just solve the Y2K problem by dumping all the old layers of computer code accumulated over the last few decades. That is not realistic. So what we ought to be trying to do is to make sure that information technology systems are brought into Y2K compliance as soon as possible. That is what the substitute that Senator MCCAIN and I have offered seeks to do, and I believe that substitute has been vastly improved now by the leadership of the Senator from Connecticut, Mr. DODD. 
   I think as this discussion goes forward in the next hour, it is also important to recognize just how dramatic the implications are for this issue. I would like to cite one example which I know a number of my colleagues on the Democratic side can identify with very easily. A lot of my colleagues, led by Senator KENNEDY, have been very concerned about making sure that there is a good prescription drug benefit for seniors under Medicare. It is the view of a lot of us that billions of dollars are wasted. Billions of dollars are wasted every single year as a result of seniors not taking prescriptions in a way so as to limit some adverse interaction. We waste billions of 
   dollars and millions of seniors suffer as a result of not taking these prescriptions properly. And the best single antidotes that we have today are some of the new online computer systems which keep track of seniors' prescriptions and are in a position to help limit these adverse drug interactions. 
   Well, the fact of the matter is, if we have, next January, chaos in the marketplace with our pharmacies and our health care systems and programs that help us limit these problems involving drug interactions, we are going to waste billions of dollars which could be used to get senior citizens decent prescription drug benefits, and we are going to hurt older people needlessly. 
   Now, that has been a problem documented by the General Accounting Office. I raise it primarily because there has been a discussion in the Senate about how this legislation is just sort of a high-tech bill, and maybe some folks care about it in the State of Oregon where we care passionately about technology, or Silicon Valley, or another part of the country. I think we all know that technology is important in every State in our Nation. But I think it is very clear that these issues dramatically affect our entire Nation. It doesn't just involve a handful of high-tech companies; it involves millions and millions of Americans. The reason I have taken the Senate's time to discuss particularly how this would affect older people with their prescription drugs is that I think this is just a microcosm of this debate. I think this is just one small example of what this discussion is all about. 
   Now, the Congressional Budget Office and other experts have estimated that Y2K-related litigation could cost consumers and businesses twice as much as fixing the Y2K problem itself. Now, I think those predictions may, in fact, be exaggerated; maybe they are wildly exaggerated. But I would much prefer to see the Senate craft responsible legislation now rather than to delay. And should the Senate not act on this legislation in an expeditious way, I believe there is a very real possibility that the Senate could be back here in January having a special session to deal with this issue. 
   So I am very hopeful that we can go forward on it. I know that the minority leader, Senator DASCHLE, has worked very hard to be fair and to ensure that there is opportunity for colleagues to raise amendments. He has been working closely with the majority leader, Senator LOTT. Those procedural issues are still to be resolved. 
   I happen to agree with Senator KENNEDY on this matter of raising the minimum wage. I think he is absolutely correct that we ought to raise the minimum wage. But I am very hopeful that we will not see these issues pitted against each other. It is extremely important to raise the minimum wage. I  also think it is extremely important to deal with this Y2K issue in a responsible fashion. 
   I know there are other Members of the Senate who wish to speak on this issue. They haven't arrived on the floor quite yet. I think I will just take an additional couple of minutes, as we await them, to outline some of the changes that have been made since the legislation left the Commerce Committee. At that time, regrettably, it was a partisan bill and did not yet have the constructive changes made by the Senator from Connecticut, Mr. DODD, and did not at that point include the eight major changes that Chairman MCCAIN and I negotiated. I would like to wrap up my initial comments by taking a minute or two to talk about those changes 
   that have been made in the legislation. For example, Mr. President and colleagues, early on none of the bills had a sunset provision in the legislation. There was a great concern that somehow some change in tort law and contract law would be for all time, establishing new Federal standards in this area. It was a feeling on my part and upon the part of other colleagues that it was absolutely critical to have a sunset provision to ensure that we were talking just about problems relating to the Y2K and not creating massive changes in Federal tort law or contract law that would last for all time. 
   None of the original bills contained a sunset date. We now have a 3-year sunset date making it very clear that any Y2K failure must occur before January 1, 2003, in order to be eligible to be covered by the legislation. Most industry analysts agree that Y2K failures are likely to follow a bell curve, a peaking on approximately January 1, 2000, and trailing off in 1 to 3 years. The sunset date that has been added tracks the very best professional analysis we have about the problem. 
   I thank Chairman MCCAIN for adding that in our initial negotiations. It is extremely important to me. I felt a lot of the Members of the Senate on the Democratic side felt that it was critical that this be a set of changes that was limited to a short period of time. That 3-year sunset addition, I think, sends a very powerful message that this is not changing tort and contract law for all time. I am very pleased that it has been added. 
   Second, in the committee there were some vague, essentially new Federal defenses that I and others felt unfairly biased this process in favor of the defendant. Those were removed. Essentially what those original provisions said was that if defendants engaged in what was called a ``reasonable effort'' that they would be protected advocates. Consumers felt strongly that this language was mushy and vague. 
   I agree completely with them on it. In fact, we originally had it in committee, and I opposed it at that time. But at the request of the consumer groups, this mushy, vague language that protects defendants who engaged in something called a ``reasonable effort'' was dropped. 
   We also made changes to keep the principle of joint liability. After the legislation left the committee, we thought it was important to make sure that for cases involving fraud and egregious conduct we kept the traditional principle of joint and several liability. It was also extended to involve insolvent defendants. 
   Senator DODD has continued to help us in this area to ensure there is fairness for injured parties while at the same time making it clear that the defendants don't pay more than the damage for which they are responsible. 
   The legislation continues to have in place what we negotiated after the legislation left the committee. This is incorporated into the announcements we made last night about the important efforts made by Senator DODD. 
   Finally, we thought it was important to make sure contract rights were paramount in this area. This legislation does not involve any changes whatever in personal injury rights. If, for example, an individual is in an elevator and that elevator falls 10 floors to the bottom of a building, and that individual is tragically injured, or dies, all of the personal injury remedies are kept in place. That is not something that would be affected by this legislation. This legislation involves contractual rights between private business parties. I and others felt that it was not adequately laid out in the committee legislation, that the contract rights were paramount in this area. As a result of the negotiations we had after the legislation left the committee, those rights were kept in place. I and others felt that was essential. 
   I see my good friend from the State of Connecticut on the floor. I am going to yield in just one second. But first I want to take a minute and tell him how much I appreciate what he has 
   done. He is, of course, the Democratic leader on the Y2K issue. 
   I am essentially still a rookie in the Senate, and the Senator from Connecticut has been so helpful as we have tried to take this legislation that passed the committee unfortunately on a partisan vote and tried to make it responsive to the many legitimate issues that have been raised by our colleagues on this side of the aisle. The colleagues on this side of the aisle have been absolutely right about saying that the original bill was not adequate with respect to punitive damages. It wasn't adequate with respect to evidentiary standards. It didn't do enough to address the issues that we heard about from the White House late yesterday. 
   As a result of an agreement led by the Senator from Connecticut, we have been responsive to those issues. We have essentially had nine major changes made after the bill came out of committee. The Senator from Connecticut has led the bipartisan effort. I discussed that bipartisan effort earlier involving Senator FEINSTEIN, Senator HATCH, and Senator BENNETT. 
   I want to yield the floor now to the Senator from Connecticut, and thank him for all he has done to make this a bill that I believe can get the support of a significant number of Democrats, because it responds to what we heard from the White House. I thank him as well personally for all of the good counsel and help that he has given me. He is the leader on this issue. He is the one who navigated the securities litigation legislation. I pointed out how he took much of what the Senate learned on the securities litigation in the earlier Y2K bill and made that part of his compromise. I thank the Senator from Connecticut. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor. I look forward to hearing from the Senator from Connecticut. 
   Mr. DODD addressed the Chair.

   Mr. WYDEN. I will be brief. I concur completely with what the Senator from Connecticut has said. I want to ask him one question about the very helpful punitive damages agreement he negotiated with us last night. 
   My understanding is, this agreement tracks very closely with what the Clinton administration has agreed to in the past with respect to product liability. In fact, our agreement seems to be more generous to plaintiffs than what the administration has agreed to in the past. 
   In the past, they seemed to have said we ought to look at something that would have two times compensatory damages. This legislation has three times the damages, to make sure there is a fair shake for the consumer. Is that the understanding of the Senator from Connecticut? I ask because he has been involved in this issue involving punitive damage questions for quite some time. I think he has been very fair to plaintiffs in this area. It seems to me, actually, the Senator has gone beyond what has been talked about in various other discussions that we had. 
   In just this minute I would like to take one more moment to hear the Senator's opinion on that issue which is a key issue for Democrats.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, as always, the Senator from South Carolina has raised a number of important issues. I will take a minute or two to respond. 
   First, it needs to be understood by the Senate that, under the substitute offered by the chairman and myself, a plaintiff can file suit immediately for injunctive relief should they choose to go that route. 
   There have been all kinds of discussion raised and I gather it is always raised by the administration that somehow the rights of plaintiffs are being cut off. The fact of the matter is, under the substitute being offered by the Senator from Arizona and myself, it is possible for a plaintiff to move for injunctive relief immediately. 
   What we are saying is, we ought to look at ways to try to bring about corrections in the private sector by private parties coming together, trying to encourage the alternative dispute resolution, a process which is clearly laid out in our legislation. 
   Our substitute makes it very clear that if a plaintiff wants to file a suit on day one, they can. If they believe they are being jerked around in the marketplace, they can go out on that very first day and seek injunctive relief. We think it would be preferable and avoids causing this bedlam with everybody rushing to court. We think a lot of those approaches can be resolved by the parties coming together. 
   Second, it seems to me those who will look at the substitute will understand in the vast majority of instances private contract law is going to govern. In most other instances it will be State law. In this administration statement, the notion is that somehow we are federalizing everything, where the substitute clearly lays out in the vast majority of cases contract law is going to take the lead in this area. That, regrettably, is a part of the administration's position that simply is not accurate. 
   In fact, I and others raised that issue in the committee. We felt there wasn't a strong enough bias in favor of protecting private contract law. That was a change made after the bill left committee, because a number of consumer and other organizations thought it was very important. 
   I think what is especially troubling about the policy statement that has now been offered by the administration--and this Senator and others are going to continue to work with them--is that they are essentially telling the Senate that over in the Justice Department they know more about the technical issues of running computers and the software businesses than do those 
   businesses that have to do it every single day. 
   The administration statement says this legislation is going to decrease the incentives, that these computer and software and other technology organizations have to be ready to assist customers to be ready for the transition of the next century. 
   The fact of the matter is, all of these groups that have to actually work with computers and software every single day believe this legislation is absolutely critical to their being ready for the transition to the next century. Essentially what we have is folks at the Justice Department on this issue saying they know a whole lot more about the technical issues of the computer business than the folks who actually have to work with these systems every single day. 
   I raise this issue again with respect to defendants who engage in truly outrageous, egregious action. There have been statements made on the floor by others and raised in the administration's letter as well with respect to the question of proportional liability and particularly what you are going to do about those defendants who engage in fraudulent activity. 
   Under the substitute before the Senate, if a defendant is engaged in fraud, it is very clear that joint and several liability stays in place. There are no changes whatever with respect to joint and several liability if, in fact, a defendant is engaged in an egregious type of conduct. We also ensure that joint and several liability is kept when a defendant is insolvent. We felt it was important to make sure the plaintiff would have an opportunity to be made whole in instances where there was an injured party who badly needed a remedy. 
   The fact is that there have been many, many changes made in this legislation since it left the committee. In order to be responsive to the consumer, the chairman of the committee reached out to a variety of parties--myself and others--in order to make those changes. I will take a minute or two to outline a couple of those. 
   Perhaps the most important is the fact that this is a bill with a strong sunset provision. Neither the original McCain legislation nor the Hatch-Feinstein legislation, which has many, many good features, nor the legislation that our colleague, Senator DODD of Connecticut, offered, which also has many good features in it--none of those bills had a sunset provision originally. 
   We felt it was important to make sure that this legislation was not producing a set of changes for all time but it was going to be legislation that specifically targets problems directly related to Y2K so we don't have an open-ended onslaught with respect to product liability issues. 
   I happen to think the Senator from South Carolina made a number of important points with respect to tobacco. I also happen to think there were other issues that were relevant on this debate. I and others in the other body were able to get the tobacco executives under oath to say that nicotine was addictive which certainly helped to open up this issue in order to protect consumers and injured parties. I think the Senator from South Carolina makes a number of important points with respect to the issue of lawyers who stand up for injured parties and consumers. 
   Make no mistake, colleagues, this is not an open-ended tort reform bill. It is not an open-ended product liability bill. It is essentially a 3-year bill to deal directly with a problem that, frankly, could not have been envisaged at the time. At the time many of these decisions were made, there was a real question as to whether there would be adequate space for disks and for memory, so there was an engineering tradeoff adopted a number of years ago to get more space for disks and memory. We find it hard today to believe that at one point disk and memory space was at a premium. It was at that time. 
   Now we are in a position where we have to come up with ways to ensure we make our computer and technology systems ready for the next century while at the same time providing a safety net when, in fact, there are real problems such as frivolous suits. 
   I hope our colleagues will look at the many changes that have been made: The fact that there is joint liability when a defendant knowingly commits fraud, there is joint liability when you have an insolvent defendant in order to make a plaintiff whole, that there are punitive damages when an individual acts in bad faith, 
   that there are not new preemptive Federal standards for establishing punitive damages, that there has been an elimination of the vague Federal defenses for reasonable efforts. 
   I hope our colleagues will look at those changes that have been made. I, for one, am going to continue to work with the administration. I think there  are many in the administration who realize this is a very, very serious problem. But I really have to say to the Senate today, with respect to the policy statement issued today, that there simply are a number of statements in there that, to be charitable, are inaccurate. The fact is, this idea that under our substitute injured persons are having their rights to sue cut off is simply wrong. Under our substitute, a plaintiff, an injured consumer, can go out and file a suit immediately on the very first day. 
   Under the McCain-Wyden substitute, if you feel that you are a wronged party, you can file a suit the first day. We just do not think, as a matter of public policy, that is a particularly good idea. We would like to encourage parties to work together in the private sector. That is what we seek to do through the 90-day period. That is what we seek to do through the alternative dispute resolution system. But for those who think it is important to basically have the right to sue immediately, our legislation does that. We do it in a way that protects, first and foremost, contract law rather than writing whole new Federal standards to govern in this area. 
   Finally, and this is perhaps the area where I have the strongest disagreement with what the administration has offered today, I find it very, very far-fetched to believe that there are folks in the Justice Department who know more about the technical issues of helping those in the technology sector get ready for the 21st century; that those folks would know more about this technical job we have in front of us than people who have to do it every single day in my home State of Oregon and across the country. Those are folks who right now, every single day, come to work saying, What are we going to do about working with our suppliers? What are we going to do about individuals overseas who may have been slow to get ready for Y2K? Those folks know a whole lot more about the challenge of getting ready for the 21st century than do the folks in the Justice Department. 
   I hope we listen to those folks across the country in the small businesses, in the grocery stores and hardware stores, who, by the way, overwhelmingly support this substitute. We have had discussions about somehow the grocery stores and the hardware stores and others are ones that are not supportive of this legislation, who feel their rights are being cut off. The fact is they are overwhelmingly in support of this legislation. 
   A lot of my colleagues, I guess, are saying: Where do we go from here? Is it just going to be impossible to move forward? I am not one who shares that view. I think there is a centrist coalition in the Senate that very much wants to get a responsible bill that meets the needs of consumers and injured parties, and is also concerned about preventing bedlam in the private marketplace next January. We have been meeting on an ongoing basis for several days now. We have had some very thoughtful ideas presented. Senator DODD has some important suggestions; Senator HATCH, Senator FEINSTEIN, and others have made real contributions. I understand our colleague from Massachusetts, Senator KERRY, continues to negotiate on several 
   of the issues that are outstanding. 
   So I am very hopeful that with the continued leadership of TOM DASCHLE and TRENT LOTT on this issue that we can continue to work through some of the outstanding issues. I have tried to respond this morning to areas where I think the administration is simply off base with respect to what the McCain-Wyden substitute is all about, but I want to make it clear I remain open to working with them. 
   But I would say now is the time for the Senate to deal with this issue. If we let this go on, if we just let it fester and take months and months and months and arrive at no resolution of this problem, I happen to think we may well be back here early next January for a special session of the Senate having to deal with this problem. There is not a Member of this body who wants that result. Let us continue to work together. 
   I plan to continue to negotiate with all the Senators I have mentioned this morning, and will continue to try to be responsive to the concerns raised by the distinguished Senator from South Carolina, although I think in the end it is quite clear we have a difference of opinion on this legislation. But this bill is too important to just say: This is it, the end, the administration has given its opinion and let's move on. 
   I think we have an opportunity to proceed under the McCain-Wyden substitute. We have made nine major changes that were requested by various organizations to be responsive to areas where they thought the committee bill was inadequate. We have made it clear we are open to a variety of other suggestions. Senator DODD, in particular, has offered several which I think are very important and ought to be addressed. I hope the Senate will continue to work in a bipartisan way to deal with this issue, because the time to deal with it is now and not next January. 
   I yield the floor.

   I also want to tell him that we have made exceptional progress in the last couple of hours, particularly in dealing  with the number of those issues that were raised in the administration's letter. 
   I really commend Senator DODD for all of his efforts. As you know, he is the senior Democrat on the Y2K Committee. He has done yeoman's work over the last couple of hours, particularly on the issue of punitive damages, which is the issue raised by this administration, and also on evidence standards to make sure that you are fair to the consumer and to the plaintiff. Senator DODD has worked very closely with the chairman of the Commerce Committee and myself, Senator HATCH, Senator FEINSTEIN. It is a bipartisan group. 
   We are going to continue to work in the spirit that the leader has talked about. As a result of the progress in the last few hours, I think we have gone a considerable distance toward meeting the leader's objective. 
   I thank the leader for yielding me the time, and also for his patience in this effort.

   Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I will be brief. I know my friend from North Carolina wants to speak as well. 
   First, as one who strongly supports Senator KENNEDY on this matter of raising the minimum wage, I think he knows that I have worked since my days as codirector of the Gray Panthers to make sure that senior citizens would get prescription drug coverage. 
   I want him to know that I look forward to working closely with him on these issues. I will, before the Senator leaves the floor, talk about why this Y2K issue is so important to those low-income seniors, 
   and on a point that the Senator from Massachusetts has led the fight on. I want to do this briefly. 
</TEXT>
</DOC>

<DOCNO>106-wyden-or-6-19990428</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WYDEN. I thank my colleague. I will make this point very briefly. One of the key concerns that senior citizens now have is the problem of taking prescription drugs in the proper way. We have learned a great deal, for example, about how billions of dollars are wasted as a result of seniors not being in a position to get good information about drug interactions. 
   One of the ways that we are best able to tackle that problem, and save billions of dollars, in order to make sure that seniors have their needs met in terms of prescriptions is to get some of this information online. This is now just beginning to be done. I submit that it is a perfect example of how we should not be pitting the issues relating to Y2K against those affecting low-income citizens. 
   I think the Senator from Massachusetts is absolutely right with respect to minimum wage, and I just say that on the basis of even the example I have given with respect to drug interactions among the elderly, and the billions of dollars that are wasted as a result of people not being in a position to take their medicine in a proper fashion. That is an example of how this Y2K issue really does affect all citizens--even on the question of pay. If the computers break down, it is going to be hard for folks to get their paychecks early next year. 
   So I think the Senator from Massachusetts is absolutely right with respect to the need to raise the minimum wage. And I share his view on the need to help seniors with respect to their prescriptions. But I do think that this question of addressing the Y2K issue in a responsible kind of way is beneficial to all Americans, regardless of their income, in our country. 
   I appreciate the courtesy of the Senator from North Carolina. I want to wrap up with a couple of comments with respect to issues that Members of my party may have about the Y2K legislation. For example, there are a number of Senators on the Democratic side of the aisle who have been concerned about the question of punitive damages. Well, in the last few hours, we have made substantial progress on this issue. I happen to believe that it is critically important that when you engage in egregious conduct, you be in a position to send a very powerful message with respect to punitive damages on these questions of fraudulent activity. 
   In the last couple of hours, a great deal of progress has been made with respect to this issue. Senator DODD, in particular, deserves a great deal of credit. These changes that have been made in the last couple of hours with respect to punitive damages respond directly to what a number of Democratic colleagues have gotten from the administration this morning. 
   The other issue I would like to touch on that was mentioned as well by a number of our colleagues on the Democratic side deals with the question of evidentiary standards. I think it is clear that we do need evidentiary standards that are fair to consumers and are fair to plaintiffs. In the last couple of hours, again, for Democrats looking at this issue, a substantial amount of progress has been made, largely due to the efforts of the Senator from Connecticut. I am very pleased to be able to report that those changes have been made as well. Democratic Senators, I think, will be pleased with some of the other changes as well. I know that early on--and I think this was a concern that the Senator from North Carolina, who has been such a valuable addition to the Senate, had raised--the bill that came out of committee talked about a very ill-defined defense for defendants, essentially saying if they engage in a reasonable effort, that would in some way provide them with a defense from wrongful conduct. That, too, has been eliminated. 
   So I am very hopeful that Members on this side of the aisle will look at the progress that has been made in the last couple of hours. I want it understood that I very much want to work with the Senator from North Carolina on the points that he, I know, is going to raise in connection with this legislation. I want to see this bill go forward. I believe there is a coalition on both sides of the aisle that is now prepared to continue to work in a constructive kind of way to get this legislation done. 
   As one who feels strongly about an increase in the minimum wage, as one who feels that this Y2K legislation, properly done, has the opportunity in it for us to help lower health care costs and make sure seniors don't have these drug interactions that hurt them and waste billions of dollars, I hope that in the name of trying to address both of those issues the Senate will move forward in a bipartisan way. 
   I will just wrap up, Mr. President, by asking unanimous consent to have printed a letter from the American Bar Association on this legislation.

   Mr. WYDEN. Thank you, Mr. President. I thank the chairman of the Commerce Committee for his comments. I will just advise my colleagues where I think we are. 
   First, I think it is important to note that the chairman of the Commerce Committee has made nine major changes in the legislation--all of them proconsumer, proplaintiff--since the time this legislation left the Commerce Committee. I and other Democrats felt it was important. I want the RECORD to show that those are major, substantive changes, and as the chairman indicated, we had some discussions with Senator DODD last night and I am hopeful they are going to bear fruit as well, because Senator DODD has tackled this in a very thoughtful way as well. 
   I also think it is important that our leadership, Senator LOTT and Senator DASCHLE, continue, as they have tried to do, to help us work through some of the procedural issues which are not directly relevant to this legislation, so that it is possible to vote on the McCain-Wyden substitute expeditiously. 
   I want to tell the Senate that now is the time when this can be done in a thoughtful and deliberative way. I don't think the Senate wants to come back next January, when there is a state of panic, as I believe there well could be, over this problem. The time to do it is now. That is what we have been working on in committee. 
   This is not a partisan issue. It affects every computer system that uses date information, and I want it understood how this happened. Y2K is not a design flaw; it was an engineering tradeoff. In order to get more space on a disc and in memory, the precision of century indicators was abandoned. Now, it is hard to believe today that disc and memory space used to be at a premium, but it was. The tradeoff became an industry standard, and computers cannot work at all without these industry standards. The standards are the means by which programs and systems exchange information, and it was recently noted: ``The near immortality of computer software came as a shock to programmers. Ask anybody who was there. We never expected this stuff to still be around.'' 
   One way to solve the problem might be to dump all the old layers of computer code, but that is not realistic. So our goal ought to be to try to bring these systems into compliance as soon as possible and, at the same time--and this is what the McCain-Wyden substitute does--have a safety net in place. 
   This is a bipartisan effort. I would like to briefly wrap up by outlining several of the major changes. The first is that there is a 3-year sunset provision. There are a number of individuals and groups who said, ``Well, this is just an effort to rewrite the tort law and make changes that are going to stand for all time.'' This provision says that any Y2K failure must occur before January 1, 2003, in order to be eligible to be covered by the legislation. 
   Second, there were various concerns that there were vague defenses in the legislation, particularly terms that involve a 
   reasonable effort. We said that that ought to be changed, we ought to make sure there aren't any new and ill-defined Federal defenses. That has been changed. 
   Finally, and especially important, for truly egregious kinds of conduct and fraudulent activity, where people simply misrepresent the facts in the marketplace, we ensure that punitive damages and the opportunity to send a deterrent to egregious and fraudulent activity are still in place. 
   So I think these are just some of the major changes we are going to outline in the course of the debate. I also say that the latest draft also restores liability for directors and officers, which was again an effort to try to be responsive to those who felt that the legislation was not sufficiently proconsumer. 
   I only say--and I appreciate that the chairman of the committee yielded me this time--that I think after all of these major changes, which have taken many hours and, in fact, weeks since the time this legislation came before the Committee on Commerce, we have now produced legislation that particularly Democratic Members of the Senate can support. 
   This is not legislation where, for example, if someone had their arm cut off tragically in a tractor accident, they would not have a remedy. We make sure that all personal injuries which could come about--say an elevator doesn't work and a person is tragically injured. This legislation doesn't affect that. That person has all the remedies in the tort law and the personal injury laws that are on the books. This involves ensuring that there is not chaos in the marketplace early next year, that we don't tie up thousands of our  businesses in frivolous suits and do great damage to the emerging sector of our economy that is information driven. 
   I thank the chairman for the many changes he has made, and I am especially hopeful that over the next few hours the two leaders, Senator LOTT and Senator DASCHLE, can help us work through the procedural quagmire the Senate is in, so we can pass this legislation now, at a time where there is an opportunity to pursue it in a deliberative way. 
   I yield the floor.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WYDEN. I do. I think there is one other important point that needs to be made. It seems to me that the legislation as it stands now makes it very clear that what is really going to govern the vast majority of cases is the written contractual terms between businesses. 
   If you look at page 11 of the subcommittee report, it makes it very clear that the act doesn't apply to personal injuries or to wrongful deaths. What is going to apply are the written contractual terms between businesses. 
   As I recall, the chairman of the Commerce Committee thought originally that in this and other major changes there ought to be a Federal standard in this area. There was a concern that was, again, writing new law and tort law. The chairman decided to make it clear that it was going to be written in contractual terms that were going to govern these agreements between businesses. 
   What is the chairman's understanding of how that came about, and why those written contractual terms were important in this reform?

<TEXT>
   Mr. WYDEN. Thank you, Mr. President. I will be very brief. 
   I specifically want to talk on this matter with respect to the evidence which would be considered in these suits. The sponsors of the substitute have made it very clear in the Senate that we will strike the clear and convincing evidence standard. It is an important point that the Senator from South Carolina has made. 
   What we have indicated is that we think it is in the public interest to essentially use the standard the Senate adopted in the Year 2000 Information and Readiness Disclosure Act which passed overwhelmingly in the Senate. So we have something already with a strong level of bipartisan support, and it is an indication again that the sponsors of the substitute want to be sympathetic and address the points being made by the Senator from South Carolina. 
   But at the end of the day, this is not legislation about trial lawyers or campaign finance. And I have not mentioned either of those subjects on the floor of the Senate. But this is about whether or not the Senate is going to act now, when we have a chance to address this, in a deliberative way, and produce good Government--something which will make sense for consumers and plaintiffs who are wronged and at the same time ensure that we do not have tumult in the marketplace early next year. 
   I am very hopeful we can go forward with this legislation. 
   I thank the Presiding Officer for the opportunity to respond. I yield the floor.

   Mr. WYDEN. I thank the Chair. 
   I have been here many fewer years than the Senator from South Carolina,  but I can tell you, just listening to him over the last few minutes, I sure agree with what he has to say about Social Security, I sure agree with what he has to say about school violence and the connections that are so important in the community between law enforcement, counselors, and the students. I could go on and on. I have supported him on many of those issues in the past and am planning to do so in the future. 
   But I did want to take the floor for just a moment and address a couple of the points that were made with respect to the Y2K issue specifically. 
   I am very hopeful that we can still see the Senate come together on a bipartisan basis to deal with this issue. The fact of the matter is that the year 2000 problem is essentially not even a design flaw. It is a problem because a number of years ago, to get more space on a disc and in memory, the precision of century indicators was abandoned. And it is hard for all of us today to believe that disc and memory space used to be at a premium, but it was back then, and that is why we have this problem today. 
   So what a number of us in the Senate want is to do everything we possibly can to ensure companies comply with the standards that are necessary to be fair in the marketplace, but also to provide a safety net if we see problems develop and particularly frivolous, nonmeritorious suits. 
   Now, with respect to a couple of the points that have been made on the record, this notion that the sponsors, particularly Senator MCCAIN and I, are trying to rewrite tort law for all time is simply not borne out by the language of this bill. This is a bill which is going to sunset in 2003. It is not a set of legal changes for all time. It is an effort to deal in a short period of time with what we think are potentially very serious problems. 
   In fact, the American Bar Association--this is not a group of people who are against lawyers, but the American Bar Association itself has said this could affect billions and billions of dollars in our economy. 
   So this bill will last for a short period of time. It doesn't apply to personal injuries, whatever. If a person, for example, is injured as a result of an elevator falling because the computer system broke down and is tragically injured or killed, all of the legal remedies in tort law remain. 
   This is a bill that essentially involves contractual rights of businesses. We respect those rights first, and only when the marketplace breaks down would this law apply. 
   We have heard a number of comments in the last few hours that this legislation throws out the window the principle of joint and several liability, a legal doctrine that I, following the lead of the Senator from South Carolina, have supported in many instances, particularly when it relates to vulnerable individuals who might be the victim of personal injuries. But this legislation specifically says that joint and several liability will, in fact, apply if you have egregious or fraudulent conduct on the part of the defendant. And, second, it will apply if you have an insolvent defendant so there will be an opportunity for the plaintiff to be made whole. We also make changes relating to directors and officers to ensure that they have to be held accountable. 
   As to the evidentiary standard, the sponsors of this legislation have made it clear that they want to work with Senator HOLLINGS and others who have questions about this standard to change it. What we wish to do is make it comply with the earlier legislation we overwhelmingly passed on Y2K.

   Mr. WYDEN. I thank the Chair. 
   The key sentence is, the Senate is expected to vote upon a bipartisan text for S. 96, the Y2K Act, which we will strongly support. There is no question about the position of the company on this legislation. 
   Finally, we have made nine major changes in this legislation since it passed the committee. I voted against it in the committee because I thought Senator HOLLINGS was absolutely right--that the legislation at that time was not fair to consumers and to plaintiffs. But as a result of the changes that were made, I believed it was appropriate to try to come up with an approach that was fair to consumers and to plaintiffs as well as the small companies involved. 
   There are other negotiations that are still going forward. Senator DODD, for example, who is the leader on our side on the Y2K issue, has a number of good and practical suggestions. Senator KERRY has some thoughtful ideas on this as well. 
   I am very hopeful that we can resolve the procedural quagmire on this issue and quickly get to a vote, up or down. Then as a result of the very useful discussion that we had between the majority leader, Mr. LOTT, and Senator KENNEDY and others, we can move on to the juvenile justice issue. Because I can assure you, as a result of what we saw in Springfield, OR, last year, we wish to have some positive contributions on that. 
   Senator GORDON SMITH and I have a bipartisan bill which has already passed the Senate once. I am hopeful we can deal with this Y2K issue expeditiously and then go on to the topic that millions of Americans, just as Senator HOLLINGS has said this afternoon, are talking about and want to see the Senate respond to. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I will be very brief. I know the Senator from South Carolina has important remarks to make this morning. 
   I have joined with Senator MCCAIN in cosponsoring this legislation that comes before the Senate, after voting against the bill that came out of the Senate Commerce Committee. I have done so because there have been at least seven major changes made in the legislation after it came out of committee so that now when it comes before the Senate it is a balanced bill. It is a bill, in my view, that will ensure that innocent consumers are fully protected while at the same time helping to prevent the kind of chaos we could have in our economy if we have scores and scores of unwarranted lawsuits as a result of the Y2K problem. 
   As we all know, the Y2K issue is not a partisan issue. It affects every computer system that uses date information, every piece of hardware, every piece of an operating support system and all software that uses date-related information. Our goal ought to be to try to bring about Y2K compliance. That is our principal focus. The Senate is already on record in that regard. At the same time, we ought to put in place a safety net to ensure that innocent consumers, particularly small businesses, will have a remedy and will not see their businesses devastated. 
   I wrap up my brief remarks this morning by outlining a few of the changes that Senator MCCAIN and I worked on with Senator DODD, Senator FEINSTEIN, Senator LIEBERMAN, and others, so that the Senate has a sense of the many changes that have been made to ensure consumers get a fair shake and that are in the bill before the Senate today. 
   The first that I think is particularly important is we will make sure there is a sunset provision in this legislation. The original bill contained no sunset provision. There were some who said this is just opening up brand new areas of tort law that are going to exist forever, this is just a backdoor effort to hot wire the legal system and ensure that we are restricting liability suits in the future. 
   That is not the future. There is a sunset date to ensure that we are addressing just legitimate problems that have come about as a result of the Y2K failures. 
   Second, and another area I feel so strongly about, is we ensure, when there are really egregious, outrageous offensive instances of conduct in the private marketplace, fraudulent conduct, that punitive damages will still be available. It is important to us that there not be new preemptive Federal standards in that area. That has been done. 
   Next, we have made changes with respect to the principle of joint liability. This is especially important where you have defendants who are involved, again, in committing these outrageous acts, essentially fraudulent acts. That is kept in place as well. 
   So I do believe this is a bill that is targeted specifically at the kinds of problems that are going to be seen if we do not pass a balanced, responsible piece of legislation. This involves business-to-business activity. I suggest to some of our colleagues this has nothing to do with personal injury issues. If someone is injured, for example, as a result of an elevator accident because computers have broken down, and is maimed or killed, all of those personal remedies will lie. 
   So those are briefly some of the changes since the bill came from committee. We have seen, again, the Senate wants to work in a collegial way on this. My good friend from South Carolina and I have had several spirited discussions on this issue in recent days. He feels very strongly about it. My part of the country has looked at technology as a big part of our economic future. We want to come up with a responsible, balanced bill. 
   The Senator from Connecticut and I have put on the desks of all Democratic Members of the Senate today a letter which outlines a number of the changes that have been made. We heard earlier Senator KERRY is pursuing some discussions as well. So I am hopeful between now and next week we can have a bipartisan bill that is balanced, that comes before the Senate and builds on the work Senator MCCAIN and I have tried to do since the partisan vote in committee. I look forward to working with my colleagues towards that end, and I yield the floor.

   Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, once again the Senate is grieving for one of our communities that has suffered a tragic school shooting. We are all profoundly saddened today by the news out of the State of Colorado. 
   For those of us from my home State of Oregon, this feeling is, unfortunately, too familiar. It was just about a year ago that this same form of evil visited Thurston High School in Oregon. And I want to say, first and foremost, to the people of Colorado that Oregon's heart goes out to all of you today. The people of Colorado are in our prayers. 
   If our experience can be any measure of comfort, I would offer the observation that in Colorado, just as it was in Oregon, the parents and students will find that their neighbors can be an incredible resource of support. There is more strength in our communities than we realize. And while nothing--nothing--can ever ease this sort of pain, that strength does possess a tremendous healing power. 
   Mr. President, why are we seeing these tragedies in our country? We feel so good about the very strong economy. We play a preeminent leadership role in the world. There are so many good things in our Nation. But we send our children off to school in the morning and so often we have to worry that they might be gunned down by a classmate. What has produced this horrible evil? 
   I do not come to the floor of the Senate today to say I have the answers, but I know that we are not 
   doing our job in this body if we do not try to find them. And it seems to me those of us from the States that have seen this horrible scourge--the Senators from Colorado and Arkansas and Kentucky and my own of Oregon--need to sit down together--and soon--and begin a meaningful conversation about the practical and concrete steps that can be taken to prevent these tragedies. We ought to talk with everyone, we ought to talk with Sarah Brady, who has one point of view, talk with the National Rifle Association, who has another point of view. We need to have a concrete dialogue with all who have been part of this national discussion to find a way to stop these tragedies. 
   In the wake of what happened in Springfield, OR, Senator GORDON SMITH and I worked, on a bipartisan basis, to make sure that if a kid brought a gun to school, action would be taken to treat that as a five-alarm warning. Looking at yesterday's tragedy, it seems to me that our bipartisan bill would not have been enough, because these students had never been caught with guns in school before. But the facts appear to be that the students there knew that this group was involved with weapons and that they had been engaged in potentially dangerous activities. We need to find ways to translate this knowledge into concrete approaches so the authorities can take steps to protect our youngsters in our schools. 
   Mr. President, so many Members of this body are parents. Many of our colleagues have been blessed with grandchildren. It chills all of us to the bone to think that this can happen in our communities, and that it has happened too often. 
   The people have elected us to lead. This is a problem which cannot be avoided. I am going to do everything I can, in a bipartisan fashion, with colleagues from other States that have seen these tragedies, to find those practical steps so parents across this country can have the certainty that when they send their youngsters to school they will come home safely at the end of the day. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. WYDEN. I thank the Chair. 
   Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Massachusetts. I know he is waiting to speak as well. I thank him for the chance to follow my colleague, Senator FRIST. 
   For too long the major political parties in this country have been at war on the education issue. Today, with this bipartisan legislation, we are beginning to make the peace and to do it in a way that is good for America's children. 
   I especially thank my colleague, Senator FRIST. He and I have worked together on this legislation for many months. The heart of this legislation is that now we will be able to take the dollars away from various bureaucratic Federal requirements and pour those dollars into our classrooms to help our kids. 
   This legislation involves eight Federal programs and more than $12 billion. What we have found in the course  of our hearings is that again and again across this country we are wasting a substantial portion of that money on various duplicative Federal rules that essentially put our local school districts through what one called to me ``bureaucratic water torture,'' when what they want to do is put those dollars into our classrooms. 
   I happen to think both political parties have made an important contribution in this discussion about education. A number of my colleagues have said, before we spend additional money, we are going to have to spend billions and billions of dollars that the Federal Government allocates today in a more effective way. 
   The Ed-Flex legislation does that. That is why Senator FRIST and I have made it a priority, and that is why we have told our colleagues in the Senate we want that to be the first education bill to come to the floor of the Senate: Before you go to the American people and ask for additional funds, demonstrate clearly you are spending the dollars that are allocated today effectively. That is what this legislation does. 
   I also think a number of our colleagues, led by the distinguished Senator from Massachusetts, Mr. KENNEDY, are absolutely right in saying that additional money is going to be needed for education. It is going to be needed to ensure we have the technology we need for youngsters. It is going to be needed to reduce class size in America, and I think that is an important part of this debate as well. When this legislation is signed into law by the President of the United States, we are going to go on to consider that legislation. I submit to our colleagues, we are in a lot better shape going to the American people to ask for additional funds when we have proven with legislation like Ed-Flex that we can squeeze more value out of the existing dollars that are being allocated. 
   Make no mistake about it, existing funds are going to be liberated with Ed-Flex and are going to help us achieve some objectives that Members of this body feel very strongly about. 
   For example, Members of the Senate on both sides of the aisle very much want to reduce class size in America. Existing dollars using the Ed-Flex program can do that. In fact, in a school a short distance from here, in Howard County, MD, the Phelps Luck Elementary School used the Ed-Flex program to reduce the average student/teacher ratio in math and reading from 25 to 1 to 12 to 1. 
   Some of us believe we are going to need additional dollars to reduce class size in America, but make no mistake about it; under the legislation that Senator FRIST and I have brought to the Senate today, we can use existing dollars to reduce class size in America. I think that is something of value to our colleagues. 
   I will pass on one example from my home State of Oregon from The Dalles High School that I think sums it all up. We found at one of our high schools in rural Oregon that low-income students were unable to take advanced computer courses at a local community college because the high school lacked the necessary equipment and instructors. Yet there was a community college very close by, and we were not able to use the dollars that had to be spent at the high school at that nearby community college without going through all kinds of redtape and bureaucracy. With Ed-Flex, we were able to use those dollars earmarked for the high school at the local community college without any additional cost to the taxpayers. The students were able to go to the community college. They got the training they needed. Ed-Flex, again, showed that with just a modest change in Federal regulation, we could do a better job of educating young people in America. 
   We have had this program, as my colleague from Tennessee has noted, in 12 States. We have debated this on the floor of the Senate for some time. And through that debate, there has not been offered one example, not one in any community or any State, of low-income students being exploited in any way. I cannot recall another Federal program where it has not been possible to show some problem somewhere, but in the course of this debate, which has gotten a bit contentious, as we know, over the last few months, not one example has been produced with respect to how this program in 12 States has been abused. 
   The fact is, it has worked. It has worked everywhere. The scores are up in the State of Texas where they are using it. Class size is down in Howard County where they are using it. Students are getting access to advanced technologies in my home State of Oregon. It has worked virtually everywhere, but it is going to work even better when we pass this legislation. 
   I will close this part of the debate by saying I am especially pleased, and I thank my colleague from Tennessee for his help on this, with the changes in this legislation to ensure that the role of Ed-Flex will be expanded in a variety of areas involving interactive computer technology in our schools. When this Ed-Flex legislation becomes law in my State, which was the very first in the country to pioneer this, it is going to start a new program using Ed-Flex authority so that every second grader in the State of Oregon will be able to use interactive computer technology to learn and improve their reading skills. 
   I am especially pleased that we have been able to add this technology waiver program. This is a good day for the Senate. 
   My colleague, Senator FRIST, thanked so many people when we were on the floor before, but I especially thank Ms. Lindsay Rosenberg of my staff who is with us here today. 
   Bipartisan legislation such as this does not happen by osmosis. It happens because a lot of our staff have spent a lot of weekends and evenings working on this legislation. Today the first bipartisan education bill is coming to the floor of the Senate. It offers a fresh, creative approach to Federal/State relations, one with enormous potential for improving education for all our citizens. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I ask the Senator from Minnesota for 10 minutes to address some of the important issues the Senator raised.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Minnesota. 
   I think he has raised a number of important issues and several that I agree with. During my 3 years in the Senate, I have consistently stated, along with the Senator from Minnesota, that we must do more. It is a moral imperative that we do more in terms of the Head Start Program, child care programs, and the variety of domestic needs that the Senator from Minnesota is talking about. To build support in America for additional funding for those programs, we ought to go to taxpayers and show them that with programs such as Ed-Flex we are squeezing more value out of the existing $12 billion that we are spending. 
   There is no quarrel between the Senator from Minnesota and I about the need for additional funding for these programs. It is absolutely essential. We also happen to agree about eliminating some of the tax boondoggles and get the money. 
   But, if we are going to get support from the American people for additional funding, it seems to me we ought to pass the bipartisan Ed-Flex bill and show that we are squeezing existing value out of the current spending, get dollars out of bureaucracy and get them into the classroom. 
   The one point I would differ with my friend from Minnesota on, and I am happy to discuss this with him, is that in the weeks and weeks that we have been debating on the floor of the Senate, there has not been one example given of how much this program has been abused in the past. This program is operating in 12 States in the country in countless communities, and we are told now we are taking a step backwards with respect to this program though there has not been one example put before the Senate of how this program is being abused. 
   We have plenty of examples of how it works. The fact is, there is one very close to this Capitol Building. Just a few miles from here in Howard County, for example, they have reduced class size by one half. They did not do that by spending extra dollars. You already heard the Senator from Minnesota and I agree on that point. We ought to spend additional funds to reduce class size. But a few miles from here they have reduced class size with existing funds. 
   So we have examples of how this program works. Yet we are told this is a big step backwards while there has not been one example, not one, of how this program has been abused though it has been in place since 1994 in 12 States. It does not change any of the core requirements of title I--civil rights laws, labor laws, safety laws; all the things that are important for vulnerable children, that the Senator from Minnesota and I agree on, are kept in place. What this is going to do, as it did in my home State of Oregon, is make it possible for poor kids, who could not get advanced computing because of Federal redtape, to use Ed-Flex so they can get those skills and get the high-wage, high-skilled jobs the Senator from Minnesota and I want to see poor kids get. 
   I am very hopeful we will see overwhelming support today for this legislation. I think by showing you can use existing dollars more effectively, this is going to lay the groundwork for the objective the Senator from Minnesota and I would like to see, which is additional support for Head Start, child care programs, domestic programs. 
   I look forward, after we pass Ed-Flex and after it works, not talking about who is wrong between the Senator from Minnesota and I, but talking about how we can join together and get additional support for Head Start, child care programs, and these domestic needs, because we can go to the American taxpayer and show that, with Ed-Flex, we use existing dollars in a more efficient way so we build more credibility with them for domestic services. 
   I look forward to working with my colleague towards those ends. I thank him for giving me the time. He feels strongly about it. I do as well. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, first let me thank my colleague from Maine and say that the reason we have come to the floor at this time is there would be an opportunity today for the Senate, after all of the frustrations surrounding the Medicare Commission, to take a major step forward in the cause of Medicare reform, and finance it in a responsible way. 
   What the Senator from Maine and I have done, both in the Budget Committee and with this amendment, is sought to ensure that the Senate would have an opportunity in this bipartisan amendment to ensure for the first time in this session the Senate could make a significant addition to the Medicare program: Start covering prescription drugs for vulnerable older people and pay for it in a responsible fashion. 
   More than 20 percent of the Nation's elderly spend over $1,000 a year out of pocket on their prescription medicine. These are older folks who are walking on an economic tightrope. They balance their food bills against their medical bills, their medical bills  against their housing expenses, and many of these older people end up with a prescription that would involve their taking three pills a day which they cannot afford. So they end up taking two pills at the beginning and then maybe they take one. They get sicker. As a result, this country's inability to finance prescription drug coverage for older people under Medicare, this results in a lot of those older folks having to 
   face hospitalizations, unnecessary surgeries, institutional health care. 
   The reason Senator SNOWE and I have acted as we have: First, to ensure that part of the onbudget surplus could be used for this additional benefit; and, second, to raise the opportunity for additional revenue through new tobacco taxes. We believe that a significant portion of Medicare expenses are due to tobacco-related illnesses. In fact, the evidence shows that perhaps 15 percent of all Medicare costs are tobacco related. 
   In this amendment we have provided a two-step process for ensuring that we will have the opportunity to finance a decent pharmaceutical benefit for low-income older people. The first is the proposition that many Democrats have felt strongly about, and that is to ensure that a portion of the onbudget surplus could be used for this benefit. Second, we have felt that it may take additional funds, which is why we are saying that the Senate Finance Committee would have the opportunity, should they choose to do so, to add to the reserve fund money that would come from a new tobacco tax. 
   I believe, having seen the frustrations of the Medicare Commission and their inability to come up with a bipartisan agreement, the Snowe-Wyden amendment, the amendment that we will vote on today, is a major step forward. 
   When we talk with our older constituents, they tell us that the great gap today in Medicare is prescription drugs. More than 37 percent of older people are responsible for their prescription drug bill. On average, they pay twice as much as those without coverage. The AARP has estimated that fee-for-service beneficiaries with annual incomes below $10,000 are estimated to be spending about 10 percent of their entire income on prescription drugs. 
   I am very pleased to have a chance, after some of the bickering that has surrounded this Medicare issue, to come to the floor of the Senate today and say that with the Snowe-Wyden amendment we are in a position to add coverage for the vulnerable older people of this country and to pay for it in a responsible way. 
   Many of our colleagues know that Medicare offers very little in the way of preventive benefits. We have finally been able to add some mammography coverage, some coverage for those with diabetes. But the fact of the matter is, this drug coverage benefit is perhaps the next best step we can take in terms of preventive health care. 
   What we are seeing with these new drugs and new therapies, they are absolutely key to keeping older people out of the hospital, to making sure we are avoiding unnecessary surgeries. I submit that this legislation, which meets an enormous need in our country, is also a major step forward in terms of preventive health services. 
   I know that there are going to be some on the Republican side and some on the Democratic side who will say that this is not perfection in terms of Medicare reform. Well, I would agree with that. But I also say that the opportunity to take a major step now to helping those 20 percent of the Nation's senior citizens who pay more than $1,000 out of pocket for their prescription drugs is certainly an opportunity that the Senate should move to take advantage of. 
   It isn't a perfect amendment. The Senate Finance Committee is going to have an opportunity to make refinements in it. But for the vulnerable older people, 37 percent of the Nation's elderly that are responsible for their prescription drug bill, this is going to mean that some of those folks are actually going to be able to pay for three pills a day when the doctor tells them that is needed. 
   I want to wrap up by thanking my colleague from Maine. She, like myself, has worked on this issue for many years--really, since our House days. I am so pleased that now we can, after there have been the frustrations surrounding the Medicare Commission, come to the floor of the Senate with a significant Medicare reform that is responsibly financed. We got a 21-1 vote in the Senate Budget Committee, and the addition that we have made today, with the opportunity for additional revenue to be generated for this program with any new tobacco tax, is another step forward. 
   I thank my colleague from Maine for this time. I know she would like to wrap up, and I tell her I very much appreciate the opportunity to, with her, address Medicare reform now in a bipartisan fashion and to meet the needs of some of the Nation's most vulnerable citizens, our elderly. I thank her for this time to speak.

   Mr. WYDEN. In a moment, I will. In the Budget Committee, this received a 21-1 vote. Suffice it to say, for an issue that has been this controversial, which generated so much discussion in the Medicare Commission, to be able to come to the Senate today with a 21-1 vote from the Senate Budget Committee and then to take the additional step that the Senator from Maine and I 
   and many of our other colleagues have taken, like Senator KENNEDY who has fought this battle valiantly for so many years--we have now taken the additional step of saying that any new tobacco tax money could be used for this program, and that strikes me as the kind of bipartisan work that the Senate ought to be doing. It would be one thing if this was a narrowly fought battle in the Senate Budget Committee. Instead, we got a 21-1 vote. 
   Now we come to the Senate floor and say that onbudget surpluses could be used to finance this program for the vulnerable, No. 1. The second is to say that any new tobacco tax revenue could be generated for this program. That is the kind of bipartisan approach we ought to be taking. I thank my colleague from Maine. I know my friend from Massachusetts wants to speak.

   Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from New Jersey for giving me this time, and also, before he leaves, the chairman of the full committee, Senator DOMENICI. Since I have been here, both Senator LAUTENBERG and Senator DOMENICI have worked very closely with me on a special passion I have in terms of public service, which is health care. I thank them for all their assistance. 
   Let me also say to the Senator from Maine, I am so glad she has been willing to put in all this time on this issue because it seems to me, colleagues, that after the Medicare Commission it is especially important that the Senate demonstrate that it is possible to take on this Medicare issue in a bipartisan fashion. The reserve fund that Senator SNOWE and I have developed, that will be perfected tomorrow, is going to allow for a significant step forward in Medicare reform. It is an addition to the Medicare program that is so important to the vulnerable elderly, but also will ensure it is responsibly financed. 
   Suffice it to say, the legislation Senator SNOWE and I have pursued is not  going to be seen as perfection to partisans on either side. But I will tell you the seniors that we represent, and there are more than 20 percent of them who spend over $1,000 a year out of pocket on their prescription medicine, they are going to say this legislation is a significant step forward. 
   We have millions of older people in this country who are walking on an economic tightrope. They are balancing their food costs against their medical bills and their medical bills against their housing expenses. They do not want to see the Senate spend its time bickering about Medicare reform. They want to see, as Senator SNOWE has just said, the Senate get serious about real reform as we have tried to do with the overwhelming vote that we got in the Budget Committee on the question of prescription drugs. 
   I think it is well understood we are literally on the cusp of a pharmaceutical revolution today. A lot of the therapies and the drugs and devices today constitute perhaps the very best health care preventive program we could have in our country, because what they do is prevent unnecessary hospitalizations. They keep older folks out of these acute care facilities. 
   I say to the Senate today, if we can take the first step, the first step in the next couple of days, with this breakthrough in Medicare in terms of covering pharmaceutical services, I think it will also constitute a breakthrough in terms of preventive health care, because I believe a lot of these new medicines can prevent hospitalizations and costly institutional care. 
   As the Senator from Maine has indicated, the heart of our bipartisan proposal is to stipulate that a portion of the onbudget surplus could be used to meet the needs of vulnerable older people. I will also say I think as the Senate Finance Committee goes forward with this issue--because, of course, it will be their job to actually craft a number of the details of this legislation--it will be possible for the Senate Finance Committee to look at a variety of ways to fund this important breakthrough in Medicare reform. But the bottom line is they will have some options in looking at this issue because, as part of the budget process, we will have set out a general outline, the overall parameters of what really would be after the Medicare Reform Commission has reported--and we have seen the frustrations that surround it. We can then say to the country 
   we at least have made the beginnings of real Medicare reform, responsibly financed. 
   I will also say I think as we go forward we ought to make some tough choices with respect to this drug benefit. Perhaps not all of our colleagues agree, but I happen to think the Senate should not say that Lee Iacocca ought to have access to the same kind of prescription benefit as would an elderly woman, a 78-year-old who has Alzheimer's, an income of $13,000 a year, and a prescription drug bill out of pocket of $2,000. I do not think we ought to treat those two the same. But that is an issue we can talk about as this legislation goes forward. 
   I indicated I would be brief. I want to wrap up by thanking our colleague from Maine, Senator SNOWE. She and I have been active in these senior issues since our days in the House of Representatives. I want to tell her I think it is especially helpful that she has been willing to come forward and lead this kind of bipartisan effort after the frustrations of the Medicare Commission so we can show the country we are at least making a beginning. 
   I know a number of our other colleagues care greatly about this issue. Senator KENNEDY from Massachusetts has been a leader in this effort to extend prescription drug coverage as well. He and I both feel strongly that the key to getting started with this issue is to use a portion of the onbudget surplus to make sure seniors, vulnerable seniors, will have access to this benefit. 
   I think there is a reason that the Senate Budget Committee voted 21 to 1, I believe, for this benefit. We are going to refine it in the next day or so, but I think we are showing the country we can expand coverage for the vulnerable and do it in a responsible way. I hope our colleagues will support our effort in the next day or so as we move to a final vote on that. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, online consumer purchases are exploding, having topped more than $8 billion last year. But the goldrush in cyberbuying is likely to carry along with it a boom in cyberfraud. As with telemarketing fraud, fraudulent schemes over the Internet are increasingly aimed at seniors--some of our most vulnerable citizens. Congress can help head-off this cybercrime by extending our current telemarketing laws to encompass fraud on the Net. That is the purpose of the legislation I am introducing today. 
   In response to the staggering $40 billion consumers lose in telephone fraud each year, Congress passed the l998 Telemarketing Fraud Prevention Act. I strongly supported that effort. The new law builds upon the four federal laws enacted since the early 1990s that deal directly with telemarketing fraud. The 1998 law stiffens penalties for telemarketing fraud by toughening the sentencing guidelines--especially for crimes against the elderly, requires criminal forfeiture to ensure the booty of telemarketing crime is not used to commit further fraud, mandates victim restitution to ensure victims are the first ones compensated, adds conspiracy language to the list of telemarketing fraud penalties so that prosecutors can find the masterminds behind the boiler rooms, and will help law enforcement zero in on quick-strike fraud operations by giving them the authority to move more quickly against suspected fraud. 
   The 1998 law is a good step forward but it's not enough to deal with today's digital economy. As more Americans--and especially seniors--go online, cyberscams are proliferating. The Congressional crackdown on telemarketing fraud will only encourage cyberscammers to migrate to the Net unless the law gets there first. That is the purpose of the legislation I am pleased to introduce today with Senator BAUCUS. 
   The Telemarketing Fraud and Seniors Protection Act, which I introduced last year as S. 2587, simply extends current law against telemarketing fraud to include the same crimes committed over the Internet. The approach expands the existing law applicable to mail, telephone, wire, and television fraud to fraud over the Internet, and its enforcement would follow the same division of labor there is today between the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and the Department of Justice. The bill would apply the same tough penalties that Congress enacted in l998 to cyberscams. The growth of Internet telephony makes it more attractive for cyberscammers to set up shop offshore, beyond the reach of U.S. law. My bill would address this problem by allowing law enforcement to freeze the assets and deny entry to the United States of those convicted of cyberfraud. 
   The bill takes special aim against those attempt to defraud one of our most vulnerable groups--our senior citizens. Seniors are the target for more than 50 percent of telemarketing fraud. Although telemarketers convicted of fraud face stiff penalties--a minimum of 5-10 years in jail and restitution payments to their victims, we also need to better educate and inform senior citizens on how to avoid becoming victims of telemarketing fraud in the first place, and how to assist law enforcement in catching the perpetrators. 
   The legislation would also authorize the Administration on Aging, through its network of area agencies of aging, to conduct an outreach program to senior citizens on telemarketing fraud. Seniors would be advised against providing their credit card number, bank account or other personal information unless they had initiated the call unsolicited. They would also be informed of their consumer protection rights and any toll-free numbers and other resources to report suspected illegal telemarketing. 
   Mr. President, the Federal Trade Commission is off to a good start against cyberscammers. Some of the operations the FTC has targeted are not companies at all, but merely websites that promise consumers everything from huge new consulting contracts to the elimination of bad credit reports. They may use scare tactics to frighten consumers into sending important personal financial information and hundreds of dollars for services the consumer will never see, or attempt to lure consumers with the promise of helping them cash in on the Internet explosion. The FTC also has a strong operation going against junk e-mailers. My legislation will complement and strengthen the FTC's effort to target telemarketing fraud over the Internet and especially when such fraud is aimed at seniors.

   Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss an issue that is vital to improving health care in America--specifically, whether the States are actually going to use a portion of the billions of dollars they received in tobacco settlement funds to keep America's youngsters from starting to smoke. The Senate has discussed this issue over the last few weeks, but I think it may be appropriate to have a new context as we go forward with these discussions. 
   To get an indication of how the tobacco industry believes it is doing and why the Senate ought to be concerned about this issue, you can take a look at how the tobacco industry assesses its executives' job performance. Recently, the public got a look at information concerning the 1998 compensation packages for several of the CEOs of the major tobacco companies. The combined compensation package for the CEO of Philip Morris and the CEO of RJR equals $36 million. 
   Last week, Mr. President, you and I marked up the Federal budget in the Budget Committee with our colleagues, but even when you spend a week dealing with the Federal budget, $36 million certainly sounds like a lot of money. 
   I am not against CEOs being compensated for their work. My guess is that the CEOs, in this case, earn their salaries. I don't think they would be pulling down $36 million a year unless they were doing a pretty good job of keeping the ashtrays filled in America. 
   Now, the combined compensation packages for just these two CEOs is more than 39 of our States and the District of Columbia would have received under the legislation Congress voted on last week. Let me be clear. Two of the tobacco CEOs were making more money in 1998 than the vast majority of our States would have received for programs to keep young people from getting started with tobacco. 
   For example, my home State of Oregon would receive just over $15 million under the legislation which was considered last week. That is less than half of the CEOs' compensation. The State of Wyoming would have received $3.61 million, 10 percent of the combined compensation packages. I believe that the traditional targets of tobacco in harvesting new smokers--women, children, and minorities--are certainly worth 10 percent of the combined compensation for 1 year of these two executives. 
   Let us also remember that it is not just the money the tobacco industry is spending on high-priced executives that the Congress should be concerned about. There is another threat to our children, and that comes from the $5 billion the tobacco industry spent last year on advertising and marketing. That is $96.2 million every week, or $13.7 million every day. Again, that is far more than many of our States would have received to protect young people from smoking. 
   Last year, in the Senate Commerce Committee, I wanted to make sure that the individuals who had historically been targeted by the tobacco companies would have been eligible to receive funds for tobacco control and prevention programs. I wanted to make sure that just as the tobacco companies have poured billions of dollars into advertising in the inner cities and for ads targeted to children, the Federal Government would make a special effort to prevent smoking in those communities.  
   I continue to believe the Federal Government needs to play an activist role in assuring that populations which historically have been targeted by the tobacco industry would be armed with good information and good preventive kinds of services, so that the tobacco companies would know that our communities are fighting back. 
   Let me give you an example of some of the steps that the tobacco companies may be pursuing in the days ahead to circumvent efforts by the Federal Government such as those we discussed last week. 
   We know the tobacco companies are now test marketing cigarettes which produce less smoke so that individuals around the smoker will not be bothered in the same way as they were so often in the past. Yet, one of the cigarettes, the Eclipse, made by RJR, is showing even more signs of being dangerous to the smoker. With the Eclipse, the evidence shows that smokers may actually be breathing in glass fibers in addition to other carcinogens. 
   I think it is important that the Senate understand this as we go forward with further discussions about how the tobacco settlement funds are going to be used. If the Federal Government wishes to waive its portion of the billions of dollars involved in the tobacco settlement, let's make sure that at least a portion of this money--at least a modest portion--is used to protect future generations of Americans against the tobacco industry. 
   I hope the Congress won't pass up another opportunity to protect America's youngsters. I urge my colleagues to continue to try to assure that some portion of the dollars secured in the tobacco settlement are actually used for health services for American's children.

    Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, the legislation I am proud to be a principal cosponsor of again today is a referendum on whether Congress will tolerate acts born out of prejudice. Every hate-filled attack, whether the target is a young gay man in Alabama or Wyoming or an African American man in Jasper, Texas, is an attack on all Americans. We must not allow such acts to stain our national greatness. 
   Our nation is committed to the ideal that all men and women are created equal, and protected equally in the eyes of the law. But some people aren't getting the message. It is high time to drive that message home. 
   The 1999 Hate Crimes Prevention Act will put bigots and racists on notice: hate and bigotry will not be tolerated in America. 
   This bill will close the loopholes in the current hate crimes laws. Right now, there's a patchwork of hate crimes laws in states across the country. This bill will provide a unified, Federal approach in how to deal with these despicable crimes. 
   It puts an end to the double standard where Federal authorities can help states and localities prosecute crimes motivated by ethnicity, religion, race, and color, but not those motivated by gender, disability, or sexual orientation. This bill would finally extend federal hate crime laws to cover attacks against women, gays and lesbians, people with disabilities. 
   It also removes the current straightjacket on local law enforcement seeking Federal help to prosecute hate crimes. Current law targets hate crimes that are committed against victims who are performing a federally protected act, like voting, or eating in a restaurant. But a hate crime is a hate crime, regardless of what the victims are doing when they're attacked. 
   With this legislation, we could prosecute under Federal law the thugs who murdered James Byrd, Matthew Shepard, and Billy Jack Gaither, as well as other victims. 
   No one is suggesting that the Federal government should override local law enforcement authorities. This bill will complement, not supplant, the work of local law enforcement in investigating and prosecuting hate crimes. It gives these local authorities more tools in prosecuting these crimes. If they need assistance in prosecuting a hate crime, then Federal authorities would be available to assist them--to make sure that justice is served. 
   Of course, no legislation can ever make up for the loss of any victim of a hate crime. But we can honor their memories by doing our best to make  sure that crimes like these never happen again.

   Mr. WYDEN. Thank you, Mr. President. 
   Mr. President, I am going to speak for a few minutes, and then I am going to yield some of our time to the Senator from New Jersey, the cosponsor of this resolution who has very strong feelings on this matter as well. We appreciate him coming over, as well, this morning. 
   Mr. President, a unilateral declaration of Palestinian statehood is irresponsible political brinkmanship, a provocative act that literally dares the State of Israel to respond, and it directly contravenes the spirit of the historic Oslo accords. 
   Six years ago, at those accords, the Israeli and Palestinian people took significant steps towards achieving peace and stability in the Middle East. Together there was a commitment to work and cooperate to produce a lasting peace through open and honest negotiations. 
   Despite that very promising beginning, the peace process is now on dangerously thin ice. The greatest risk to stability in the Middle East today is a repeated threat by Palestinian leaders to unilaterally declare statehood once the historic Oslo accords expire on May 4. Not only would such a declaration run counter to the spirit of the accords, but it would truly send a chilling message to all those who want meaningful peace in the Middle East. 
   That meaningful peace is why Senator BROWNBACK and I in our bipartisan resolution today have garnered the support of 95 Members of the U.S. Senate to stand in strong opposition to a unilateral declaration of a Palestinian state. We believe that step would constitute an ill-conceived plan that would truly short circuit the peace process. It would be bad news to all those who value stability in the Middle East. 
   The question of achieving Palestinian statehood while maintaining Israel's security lies at the heart of the conflict between Israel and the Palestinian people. It is not going to be resolved overnight with a press release. It is going to take careful face-to-face negotiations and real commitment from both sides. 
   Both Israeli and Palestinian leaders made a commitment in the Oslo accords to go forward with the negotiated process. Chairman Arafat said so himself in a letter to Prime Minister Rabin in 1993. In his own words, he said, ``All outstanding issues relating to permanent status will be resolved through negotiations.'' He needs to be held to this promise. Israel has held up its end of the bargain. Mr. Arafat must do the same. 
   A rash move such as unilateral declaration would derail these negotiations and risk a dangerous escalation of this conflict. This sheer defiance of both the Oslo accords and the peace process would be the diplomatic equivalent of drawing a line in the sand, which invites a response and a potential escalation of this conflict. 
   On the playground, fights begin when the schoolyard bully balances a stick on his shoulder and dares someone to knock it off. A unilateral declaration of statehood employs the same kind of school-yard bullying--it dares the State of Israel to respond. And when Israel does respond by taking reasonable and necessary steps to ensure its security, these actions would be used as an excuse to further escalate this conflict. 
   How long would it be before we have Israeli defense forces and Palestinian militiamen standing eyeball to eyeball across the disputed boarder waiting for the other to blink, if there is a unilateral declaration of statehood? 
   How long before tensions rise so high that the smallest spark ignites more violence? 
   How long before we are faced again with the disturbing images where both Palestinian and Israeli mothers are shown mourning their children slain in some senseless act of violence? 
   The people of the Middle East have been down that road before. They have tried the old ways in resolving conflict through violence and bloodshed. Now they want the opportunity to use peaceful negotiation to resolve their differences. Let us not sabotage the prospect of peaceful resolution with a unilateral declaration. The Oslo peace process is a valuable opportunity to begin healing centuries-old wounds. A unilateral declaration of statehood would only reopen those old wounds and eventually lead to yet more bloodshed. 
   No one wants to see diplomats being replaced by armed soldiers. No one wants to see open dialog give way to angry threats. The peace process will be far better served by an open hand extended in friendship than by a fist clenched in anger. 
   Mr. President, the resolution that we will be voting on today is vitally important to keep the peace process moving forward. With overwhelming bipartisan support in the Senate, we have the opportunity to send a clear, unequivocal message that we stand united in our opposition to a unilateral declaration of statehood. This resolution will hopefully make Palestinian leaders think twice about scrapping the peace process. 
   I am pleased that the President of the United States indicated his opposition to a unilateral declaration of statehood. The reason so many Members of the Senate join us today in this bipartisan resolution is we wish to drive this message home even further. 
   The President is going to be meeting with Chairman Arafat in several weeks to discuss this important issue. By the Senate making this unequivocal assertion this morning, we can strengthen his hand as he goes forward using the Oslo peace process to make sure that there are no end runs around the critically needed negotiations. 
   I am optimistic that a peaceful resolution can be found in the Middle East. Last month, Israeli and Palestinian authorities committed themselves to try to change the images they have of each other and to break through the mistrust that has divided them for so long. 
   They decided to exchange columns in each other's newspapers and to hold joint briefings for Israeli and Palestinian journalists. These are positive steps toward peace, and I'm hopeful to see more of this kind of cooperation in the Middle East. 
   But even an incurable optimist like me knows that it would be difficult to take further positive steps after a bad-faith attempt to unilaterally declare independence. 
   Palestinian statehood is a complex issue that must be dealt with carefully. It cannot be resolved through force or fiat. The prospect of peace in the Middle East is just too important to risk in a game of political chicken. If the Palestinian leadership is truly serious about peace, they will abandon the prospect of unilateral statehood.

   Mr. WYDEN. Thank you, Mr. President. 
   Mr. President, as an Oregonian, I am especially proud this evening that a program that began in my home State--we were the first to get an Ed-Flex waiver--on the basis of this vote in the U.S. Senate, this program that began in my State is going to be expanded across the country. 
   I would like to spend just a couple of minutes of the Senate's time this evening, and first begin by thanking my colleagues who put so much effort into this. 
   Senator FRIST is here this evening. He and I have been living and breathing this legislation for well over a year. 
   I think it is worth noting that this began in the Senate Budget Committee. Senator DOMENICI worked on a bipartisan basis with a number of us. And this legislation began with hearings in the Senate Budget Committee. 
   I thank the Senator from Tennessee for the opportunity to work with him. 
   I also see Senator JEFFORDS here. He was especially gracious to me this afternoon. He pointed out that from time to time it felt a little lonely on their side. But I want to assure him that I think that this is truly bipartisan. 
   Senator DASCHLE every step of the way was enormously supportive in this legislation. I thank Senator KENNEDY. He had to leave this evening. But he worked very closely with us, especially on the accountability provision. 
   Now, shortly after dealing with the impeachment matter, the Senate can show that we have dealt with the premier domestic issue of our day--the premier domestic issue of our day--education, in a bipartisan fashion. It is always possible in the Senate and just about anywhere else to find something on which to disagree. The Senate ultimately resisted that proposition, and we went forward with something we could agree on, which is the principle that you ought to squeeze every dollar of value out of the Federal budget for education in order to help the kids, to help them raise their scholastic performance, to deal with the issues that were debated on the floor of the U.S. Senate. 
   I think my only regret is that to some extent in the last hours of this discussion it became a debate about whether you are for more resources for education or whether you are for more efficiently allocating the dollars that are currently obligated. I think that is a false choice. 
   I happen to believe that we are going to need some additional resources for the key education areas. We want our young people to get a good quality education so they will be ready for the high-skill, high-wage jobs of tomorrow. 
   But the single best way to go to the taxpayers when additional resources are needed is to show the taxpayers that you are efficiently spending the dollars that are currently obligated. 
   That is why Ed-Flex is so important. All across the country we saw that without Ed-Flex what you have is sort of a ``one-size-fits-all'' approach to education. Folks inside the beltway will say, ``Well, what works in Coos Bay, OR, is what we ought to do in the Bronx, and what works in the Bronx ought to 
   be done in the State of the majority leader, the State of Mississippi.'' That doesn't make sense. 
   We ought to hold school districts accountable. But we also ought to give them the freedom to be innovative and creative and make those dollars stretch so that we can serve more poor schoolchildren. 
   The fact of the matter is that there is a school very close to the U.S. Capitol that has cut class size in half with Ed-Flex using existing dollars. They didn't spend $1 more, not one, and they cut class size in half. 
   In my home State of Oregon, in one rural district, the poor kids weren't able to get advanced computing, because their school district didn't have the technology and they didn't have the instructors. There was a community college close by with Ed-Flex. Without any additional expenses to the taxpayers, those kids could go to the community college and get the skills they needed. Again, we see a concrete example of how with just a little bit of flexibility we can better serve the poor kids of this country. 
   We were on the floor of the U.S. Senate, I guess, for the better part of 2 weeks dealing with Ed-Flex, and not one single example of abuse was ever shown on the floor of the Senate--not one. But there were plenty of examples of how this program worked. I just cited one close by the Capitol that cut class size in half. In Texas, the scores went up with better use of technology. From one end of the country to the other, we see how this program has worked. 
   I know that my colleagues wish to speak tonight on this issue. But I just wanted to take a minute or two to talk about why I think this is a particularly good day for the U.S. Senate. There is no issue more important than this. 
   I see the majority leader is here. I want to express my thanks to him, and to TOM DASCHLE. 
   The fact is that this important legislation could have blown up 15 or 20 times in the last few days. And Tom DASCHLE and TRENT LOTT said that this was too important to let that happen. 
   Senator KENNEDY and Senator JEFFORDS hung in there as well, with Senator FRIST, who constantly came to the floor and just appealed to let this bipartisan idea, which every Governor in the country wants, to go forward. We were able to get it done.  
   I suspect the conference on this legislation will not be for the fainthearted. There are certainly differences of opinion on a number of the issues. 
   But this is a very good day for the U.S. Senate, and a good day for American families, because we have shown that we could tackle important issues. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor. 
   Mr. JEFFORDS addressed the Chair.

   Mr. WYDEN. I appreciate the Senator yielding. It has been a great pleasure for me to have a chance to work with him, on a bipartisan basis, for this legislation, and I feel it will be very helpful if he can just take a minute and outline the breadth of support for this legislation. Because, certainly, when we began this discussion, I don't think most Americans could have told you anything about Ed-Flex. We joked most people would think this was the instructor at the Y, the new aerobics instructor. 
   But the fact is that just a few miles from this Senate Chamber, a school is using Ed-Flex and the existing dollars to cut class size in half. That is going on today using existing dollars. Not spending one penny more of Federal funds, we are seeing a school close to the United States Capitol cut class size in half. 
   If you listened to this debate--and I happen to be for the hiring of the additional teachers--you would get the impression that the only way you could cut class size in America was to spend more Federal money. 
   I happen to think we do need to spend some additional dollars, which is why I support the Kennedy and the Murray amendments. I also share the  view of the Senator from Tennessee that we can cut class size now, using existing dollars. 
   I think it would be very helpful, given the fact that we are so close now to the agreement--I really commend the minority leader, Senator DASCHLE, and the majority leader, Senator LOTT, because they have gotten us right to the brink of having an agreement so we can go forward with this legislation--if my friend and colleague could just outline for the Senate the breadth of support for this legislation. I appreciate him yielding to me for this time.

   Mr. WYDEN. Thank you, Mr. President. 
   Mr. President, I would like to follow up briefly on this Ed-Flex issue, first to thank the minority leader, who is clearly making a very strong effort to work this out and be conciliatory. 
   I would also like to thank the majority leader, Senator LOTT, who is making such an effort as well. 
   I want to advise our colleagues that we are going to work 
   through the weekend to try to come up with a way that is fair for all concerned. 
   I think Senator DASCHLE made it clear these Democratic amendments are critical, it is important there is an opportunity they be discussed, and--conciliatory on the part of the leader--that there would be time agreements. I think the majority leader has made a very sensible statement of why this bill is a priority. 
   It is critically important that the more than $11 billion that go out in programs covered by Ed-Flex is spent wisely. What we have found in the 12 States that are now using Ed-Flex is that a few miles from here, just a few miles from here, existing dollars now allocated under title I are being used to cut class size in half to make sure that kids can get the education they need. 
   For those of you who think that the Senator from Washington, Senator MURRAY, is making an important contribution in terms of the extra teachers, I want it clear that I support that. It is needed. But I support just as strongly--and I would say this especially to my Democratic friends--the proposition that we use money that is now allocated wisely. And we are not doing that today. 
   Under current law, for example, poor kids who want to get access to advanced computing aren't able to do it in a lot of instances because these programs put them into a regulatory straitjacket. In a lot of instances, we could boost the test scores up for poor kids. We haven't been able to do that because of some of the bureaucracy associated with these programs. 
   Last night we had a discussion about what these programs mean to parents. I happen to agree with the distinguished Senator from Massachusetts, the parents don't focus on Ed-Flex in bureaucratic terms. They do focus on results. I can assure you, the parents of those youngsters a few miles from here who have had their class size cut in half as a result of Ed-Flex are very appreciative of that. Because of Senator KENNEDY and Senator Hatfield, in 1994 we began this effort to pass Ed-Flex. It is time to expand it. 
   Around this country there has not been one example of an abuse associated with Ed-Flex--not one. But there are plenty of examples of why Ed-Flex is working for poor kids from coast to coast. Go see those kids in the State of Maryland--our friend, Senator SARBANES, is here--where they have used those dollars to cut class size. Or come to my home State of Oregon where, because of bureaucratic rules, it was not possible for poor kids to get advanced computing at their schools. 
   I know a number of my colleagues would like to speak, and I want to let them have that opportunity. But just know--because of the very conciliatory offer that has been made by the minority leader, Senator DASCHLE, this morning, and the majority leader, Senator LOTT, I believe is also trying to accommodate both sides--those of us who are sponsoring this legislation are going to work throughout the weekend to see if we can get a sensible time agreement that is fair to both sides. 
   As the Democratic sponsor of Ed-Flex, I want to again state to my colleagues, I think the contribution of our friend from Washington, Senator MURRAY, is important and the Boxer amendment on afterschool programs is critically important--but it is just as important to show that those $11-plus billion that are now allocated in title I and other programs are being spent wisely. In fact, for those colleagues who share my view that we need more financial assistance in these key areas, I submit the best way to make the case for getting additional funds is to show taxpayers you are spending more wisely the dollars that are allocated at this time. 
   I look forward to some long hours over this weekend, working with our colleagues on both sides of the aisle. Education, in my view, is the premier issue of our time. I think that is why the Members of the Senate feel so strongly about it. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. WYDEN. Thank you, Mr. President. 
   Mr. President, I am sure that many Americans who are watching this debate hear the words ``Ed-Flex'' and wonder what in the world is the U.S. Senate talking about? My guess is that we probably have some folks thinking that Ed-Flex is the new guy who has been hired to run the aerobics class at the local health club. But since my home State of Oregon was the first to receive an Ed-Flex waiver, I would like to take a few minutes to tell the U.S. Senate why Ed-Flex makes a real difference and especially why it has been a valuable tool to improve the lives of poor children. 
   To begin with, Ed-Flex represents a new approach in Federal-State relations. Right now, there are two schools of thought on the relationship of Washington, DC, to the States. One side says everything ought to be run at the Federal level, because folks locally can't be trusted to meet the needs of low-income people. The other side says the local folks ought to be able to do it all, because everything the Federal Government touches turns to toxic waste. 
   Ed-Flex represents a third-wave approach, and we have pioneered it in a variety of areas, including health, welfare and the environment, and now in education, in addition. 
   We told the Federal Government in each of these areas that we will meet the core requirements of Federal law. The Federal Government ought to hold us accountable, but, at the same time, the Federal Government ought to give us the flexibility to make sure that we can really meet the needs of our citizens--in this case, the poor children--rather than building up bureaucracy. 
   Ed-Flex has been good for students, but especially good for poor students. There are no examples of abuse, Mr. President--not one. We have asked the opponents of this legislation to give us even a scintilla of evidence of an abuse, and they cannot cite one example for a program that has been used in 12 States. But I will tell you there are plenty of examples where this program has worked for poor children. 
   In Maryland, one low-income school used Ed-Flex to reduce class size. Class size dropped under this Ed-Flex program from 25 students to 12. And the last time I looked, a fair number of Members of the U.S. Senate wanted to see class size drop. 
   In our home State, Ed-Flex helps low-income high school students take advanced computer courses at the community college. Before the waiver, Federal rules would only allow high school students to take computer courses offered at the high school. If a student wanted to take an advanced computer course, but the school didn't have the equipment or the people to teach advanced computing, those poor kids were out of luck. But we found a community college that was just a short distance away with an Ed-Flex waiver where we could take the dollars that 
   would have been wasted because there were no facilities at the high school, and the poor kids learned at the community college. No muss, no fuss. But we did what the Federal Government ought to be trying to do, which is to help poor children. 
   In Massachusetts, a school with many low-income kids who are doing poorly in math and reading received title I funds in 1997; but they were denied title I funds the next year because of a technicality. This meant that low-income children who were getting special help with title I funds in 1997 could not get those funds in 1998 for one reason, and that was bureaucratic red tape. But when they got an Ed-Flex waiver, they could use the dollars to serve low-income children and make sure that they could use that help until they had addressed the mission of the program. 
   Ed-Flex doesn't serve fewer poor kids; it serves more of them, and it serves them better. 
   In the State of Texas, the State has used Ed-Flex, and the achievement scores confirm that Ed-Flex has improved academic performance. After only 2 years under the waiver, statewide results on the Texas assessment of academic skills shows that schools using Ed-Flex are outperforming the districts that aren't. These are poor school districts with low-income children, and reading and math scores are rising using Ed-Flex. At one high-poverty elementary school, student performance improved almost 23 percent over the 1996 math test scores; 82 percent of them passed. The statewide average was only 64 percent. Poor kids did better. Poor kids did better under Ed-Flex. 
   Now, this legislation protects the poor in other important ways. The civil rights laws, the labor laws, safety laws, all of the core Federal protections for the vulnerable, are not touched in any way. The Secretary of Education has complete authority to revoke a waiver if title I requirements are not met. Under current law, a State must have a plan to comply with title I. This legislation requires a plan as well. 
   Let me outline a number of specific protections that pertain to the poor in this legislation. First, under current law, title I funds can only be used in school districts that are for the low-income. Our legislation keeps this requirement. You cannot get an Ed-Flex waiver and move it out of a low-income school district to somewhere else. You have to use those dollars in a low-income school district. They can't be moved elsewhere. 
   Second, not only does the legislation keep the core requirements of title I, it strengthens them. For example, under current law, States are not required to evaluate whether they are meeting title I goals until 2001. Ed-Flex says to the States: Why should you wait for 2 years to show that you are serving the poor and disadvantaged? Develop high standards for serving the poor now, demonstrate that you meet the accountability requirements, and put more education dollars in the classroom to serve poor kids and their families now, rather than waiting until 2001. 
   Now, opponents of Ed-Flex have not been able to offer any examples--not even one--of how the flexibility waivers have been abused, and that is because the Secretary of Education has watch-dogged these Ed-Flex waivers; and we can cite examples of how it works, and they can't cite any examples of how it has been abused. That is why the Education and Labor Committee in the last Congress approved this legislation by a 17-1 bipartisan vote.  
   Senator KENNEDY, the ranking member of the committee, said,  
   Under Ed-Flex, the Secretary of Education allows Massachusetts and other States to waive Federal regulations and statutory requirements that impede State and local efforts to improve learning and teaching. With that flexibility comes stronger accountability to improve student achievement.  
   Since that time, since those eloquent words of Senator KENNEDY, in a 17-1 vote in the Labor Committee, after lengthy debate, the sponsors felt that it was important to work with those who have had reservations about this legislation, and we have made six additional changes in the legislation to strengthen a bill that had virtual unanimous bipartisan support. We have strengthened the requirements for public participation so that there is public notice. We put in place a requirement that States include specific, measurable goals, which include student performance, 
   a requirement that the Secretary report to the Congress after 2 years on how Ed-Flex States are doing. The Secretary must include how the waiver is affecting student performance, what Federal and State laws are being waived, and how the waiver is affecting the overall State and local reform efforts. 
   There is a requirement that the Secretary review State content and performance standards twice, once when deciding if the State is eligible to participate and again when deciding whether or not to grant approval for a waiver. This is to make sure that there is no compromising title I. The Secretary of Education reviews twice whether or not to go forward with an Ed-Flex waiver. 
   We have always altered the legislation to ensure that local review cannot be waived under Ed-Flex; that is, any school or school district receiving title I funds is still subject to punishment and still has to answer to a local review board. Those provisions that protect the poor cannot be waived. 
   Mr. President, it is no accident that every Governor, every Democratic Governor, believes this will be a valuable tool to them to make existing programs work better. 
   I think the Senator from Minnesota has made an important point in talking about how additional dollars are needed for some of these key programs to serve the poor. But the best way to generate support for that approach is to show that you are using the dollars that you get today wisely. That is what Ed-Flex allows. It is a fresh, creative approach to Federal-State relations, one that has enormous potential for improving the delivery of services to the poor and all Americans. 
   So I say to the Senate that we have a chance to take a new, creative path with respect to Federal and State relations where one side says all the answers reside in Washington, DC, and the other side says, no, they all reside at the local level. The third path that is being taken by Ed-Flex, that is being taken by my State in health, in welfare, in the environment, says to the Federal Government: At the local level, we will meet the requirements of Federal law, Federal education law. We will be held accountable. But in return for holding us accountable, give us the flexibility so that we can ensure that we come up with solutions that work for Coos Bay, OR, and The Dalles, OR, and you don't take a ``one-size-fits-all'' cookie-cutter approach and say that what is done in the Bronx is what is going to work in rural Oregon. 
   Before I wrap up, I would like to pay a special tribute to our former colleague, Senator Hatfield. I served in the House when Senator Hatfield took the lead in 1994, working with Senator KENNEDY and others, to promote this approach. In my view, his record alone, standing for years and years for civil rights laws, for health laws and safety laws, would suggest that there is a commitment by the sponsors of this legislation to ensure that this helps the poor, not hurts the poor. 
   If there was one example, Mr. President, even one, of how an Ed-Flex waiver has harmed the poor, I know I would immediately move to address that and to ensure that our legislation didn't allow it. But we have no examples of how in any of those States the poor have been exploited or taken advantage of. We have plenty of examples of how Ed-Flex has worked in Texas where the scores have gone up, in Maryland where it has reduced class size, in Oregon where poor kids who couldn't get advanced computing under the status quo were able to use Ed-Flex dollars to get those skills that are so critical to a high-skill, high-wage job. 
   So I urge the Senate today to vote for the motion to proceed, vote for the bill, empower the communities across this country to earn the right to use Federal education dollars to serve the vulnerable in our society most effectively. This is not the sole answer to what is needed to improve education, public education, in our country, but it is an important step, because it shows the people of the country that we can use existing Federal funds more effectively, that we can be more innovative in serving poor kids. It seems to me that step does a tremendous amount to lay the foundation to garner public support for areas where we need additional funds. 
   We are going to need additional funds for a number of these key areas that the Senator from Minnesota is right to touch on. But let's show the taxpayer that we are using existing dollars effectively, as we have done in Oregon, as we have done in Texas, as we have done in Massachusetts, in line with objectives that, as far as I can tell, are widely supported on both sides of the aisle. 
   I see the Senator from Tennessee has joined as well, and the Senator from Minnesota was kind enough to give me time from his allocation. I would just wrap up by thanking the Senator from Minnesota and also say that I very much appreciated working with the Senator from Tennessee on this legislation. I think it is clear that the country wants to see the U.S. Senate work in a bipartisan way on this legislation. 
   This bill had exhaustive hearings in the Senate Budget Task Force on Education. It was debated at length in the Education and Labor Committee, where it won on a 17-to-1 vote in the last 
   session of the Senate. Since that time, as I have outlined in my presentation, additional changes have been made to promote accountability. 
   I urge my colleagues to support the legislation. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. WYDEN. I thank the chairman. 
   Senator FRIST has said it very well. Mr. President, and colleagues, all we want to do under Ed-Flex is to make sure that these dollars get into the classroom to help poor kids and not get chewed up by bureaucratic redtape. 
   Ed-Flex is not a block grant program. It is not a voucher kind of scheme. The people who are advocating Ed-Flex in my home State of Oregon do not want a Federal education program to go away. Quite the contrary, they want those programs. They know that we need those dollars to serve low-income students. What we want is, we want some freedom from some of the Federal water torture and bureaucratic redtape that so often keeps us from using those dollars to better serve the poor. 
   I would just hope, Mr. President, and colleagues, that during the course of the afternoon colleagues look at the requirements that protect the poor families and the poor children that cannot be waived under the Ed-Flex statute. Specifically, it is not possible to get a waiver if you are trying to waive the underlying programs of each of the critical services that is made possible under title I. You cannot do it. And as I stated earlier, you can only use those dollars in a low-income school district; you cannot move those dollars out of a low-income school district and take them somewhere else. 
   So there is a reason for the Governors and all of the Democratic Governors supporting this legislation. I happen to have some sympathy for the Senator from Minnesota about the need for additional dollars for a variety of human services. But the best way to win support for that additional funding is to show that you are using existing dollars well and effectively. That is what Ed-Flex does. 
   I am very pleased to have had a chance to team up with Senator FRIST of Tennessee who has worked very hard to bring both parties together. And I thank the Senator from Vermont for the time. 
   I yield the floor, Mr. President.

   Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, the distinguished Senator from Massachusetts has given, in my view, a very important address to the U.S. Senate. I want to take a few minutes and try to respond to a number of points. The Senator has made a number of points that I certainly agree with as a Democratic sponsor of this legislation, along with the Republican sponsor, Senator FRIST. But there are a number of areas where I think the record indicates that we ought to take another look. 
   For example, the distinguished Senator from Massachusetts has said that, in some way, the States are being free riders here, that they are asking the Federal Government to waive various regulations, but the States are somehow not willing to do that. As our colleagues will see on page 6, line 7, it is specifically required that the States are willing to do some heavy lifting and also be part of this effort to show that they are going to try to ratchet out of their systems some of the foolish bureaucracy. This ought to be a two-way street and I think the distinguished Senator from Massachusetts is absolutely right in insisting on that. What is thus required today, the legislation spells out on page 6, line 7, that the States are not going to be able to be free riders. They are going to have to waive some of these mindless regulations as well. I think that is an important point for the U.S. Senate to consider as we go forward. 
   Now, another area that has been raised is this question of smaller class size. I think the Senator from Massachusetts again is absolutely right in saying that we do need additional funds to reduce class size in America. I have, on several occasions, voted for just those kinds of measures to provide additional funds to reduce class size. But I think it is important to note that Ed-Flex, now in 12 States, is helping us to reduce class size using existing law. The Senator from Massachusetts is correct; we do need additional funds to reduce class size, but let us not pass up the opportunity to use existing law, existing Ed-Flex opportunities to reduce class size. For our colleagues who would like to have a good example of how Ed-Flex helps to reduce class size, we can turn to the Phelps Luck elementary school in Howard County, MD. There they put a special priority on reducing class size with their Ed-Flex waiver. They were able to lower the student-teacher ratio from 25-to-1 to 12-to-1. 
   As we go forward with efforts to try to get additional funding that we need to reduce class size in America, which we know is so critical in improving student performance, let us not pass up the opportunities to use the Ed-Flex program to make it possible with existing dollars to reduce class size in America. 
   Third, Mr. President and colleagues, there have been questions raised about whether the dollars are going to get to the neediest children, and particularly with respect to title I, which is one of the seven programs that are eligible for Ed-Flex but certainly is an especially important program to all of us. 
   What we have done--and we have outlined it here--is we have kept in place every single one of the core requirements with respect to title I protecting our neediest kids. It is off the table, folks, in terms of waiving any of those core requirements. You can't do it; it is off the table. And although it is hard for Members of the U.S. Senate to see these charts, we specifically outline the requirements that cannot be waived. 
   In addition, with respect to title I--I think there is some confusion perhaps at this point with respect to how the Ed-Flex funds can be used--under current law, you can only put those dollars into low-income school districts. That is the only place they can go. We keep that requirement. So today, and under this Ed-Flex legislation that is before the U.S. Senate, it is not possible to flex any dollars away from a program to help low-income youngsters and send them packing to another district that will not need them as much. 
   I would like to spend a little bit more time on this question of accountability, because this is an area where the sponsors of the legislation have been very open to trying to address the concerns of those who have begun to look at this program and may not have been familiar with it in the past. 
   But I want to say that we have made six changes in the legislation since it came out of the Senate Labor Committee last year by a 17 to 1 margin. In addition to the public notice and opportunities for citizen comments that the distinguished chairman of the committee, Senator JEFFORDS, touched on, there are requirements for specific measurable goals, which include student performance, which Senator KENNEDY is right to focus on. There are reports that would be required for the Congress every 2 years on how the Ed-Flex States are doing. 
   And then I am especially pleased that we have required now that a State review a State content and performance standard twice: First when it is decided that the State is eligible to participate, and again when deciding whether or not to grant approval for the waiver. This makes it clear that a State must be in compliance with title I. If it is not in compliance with title I, it isn't going to get a waiver. If at any point it has been given a waiver and it is not in compliance with title I, the Secretary has the authority to come forward and revoke it. 
   So the accountability provisions have been especially important to the sponsors of this legislation. And this idea that somehow Ed-Flex has relaxed the standard is simply not true on the basis of the clear language of the bill. These requirements are kept in place. We have added six requirements for accountability since the legislation came out of committee. 
   I would like to wrap up by giving the U.S. Senate an example of how I got into this issue, because I think it is important to get beyond some of the rhetorical arguments about this legislation and talk about real people, real people who benefit, especially the low-income kids of our country. 
   We have a high school about an hour from my hometown in Portland. They wanted poor kids to get help with advanced computing. The problem was that the school didn't have the 
   instructors who could teach advanced computing and they didn't have the equipment. So under current law, those youngsters, low-income youngsters, wouldn't have had the opportunity to pick up those skills to put them on the path to high-skill, high-wage jobs. 
   But in this rural district an hour from my home town is a community college just a short distance away that would make it possible, with instructors and equipment, for those poor kids to get help with advanced computing. So instead of students who couldn't get what they needed without additional funds, without additional redtape and bureaucracy, what this town did in rural Oregon was simply say we are going to use the dollars that we aren't equipped for at the local high school to make sure that the kids get advanced computing at a community college just a short distance away. 
   That is what Ed-Flex is all about--taking this regulatory straitjacket off some of the thousands and thousands of school districts across the country. They can't use the money for pork barrel projects. They can't use it to waive standards. They have to comply with accountability. But they can teach advanced computing to poor kids. That is why it is going to make a difference when we extend this to 50 States. 
   I am looking forward to working with our friend and distinguished colleague, Senator KENNEDY, who knows so much about this issue, on his amendment with respect to the achievement standards. My understanding is we are getting fairly close on that. I want to make sure, in particular, that we can incorporate what the schools call the student performance standards, so it includes some of the things like dropout rates and issues like that in addition to the tougher test scores. But I think Senator JEFFORDS spoke for all of us a minute or so  ago where I think we are getting close, and I want Senator KENNEDY to know that we are going to go forward in good faith and try to work that amendment out. 
   Finally, the last point I want to make deals with the parental involvement issue. We keep in place all requirements for parental involvement--all of it. But it seems to me, Mr. President, and colleagues, that if we are talking about the best way to get folks involved in a convenient, accessible kind of way, it is to have these Ed-Flex programs that empower local communities to set up opportunities for folks to participate. 
   I know that people in rural areas who are 3,000 miles away from Washington, DC, find it a lot harder to come to one of the useful hearings and forums that are held by the distinguished Senator from Massachusetts. I can get to them. I find them very, very useful. But I can tell you that folks in rural Oregon would much rather be empowered to participate at the local level than to try to say we are going to in some way skew more of the parental involvement back to Washington, DC. 
   At the end of the day, what Ed-Flex is all about is a third path with respect to Federal-State relations. We now have two camps on this issue. There is one camp that says only the Federal Government has the answer, that those folks at the local level can't chew gum and walk at the same time, do not trust them, and run these programs at the Federal level. Then there are a group of people 180 degrees the other way. They say that everything the Federal Government touches turns into toxic waste, just give us all the money at the local level, and we can't possibly do any worse with those dollars than the Federal Government does. 
   What Ed-Flex is all about--and in Oregon, particularly with Senator Hatfield's leadership, we have done it in health, in welfare, with the environment--what we have said is that Ed-Flex is a third path. And we have told the Federal Government, in areas where we have received waivers, that we will meet all the requirements of the Federal laws, all of them, and the Federal Government can hold us accountable; but in return for that commitment to comply with all of the Federal laws, give us in Oregon the chance to tailor the approaches that we are using to meet the individual needs of our community. 
   I feel very strongly that poor kids need the funds that are available under title I. I will fight as hard as any Member of the Senate to make sure that there is no compromise there. But I do think that in coming up with approaches to best meet the needs of kids at the local level with respect to title I, what works in rural Oregon is going to be different than what works in the Bronx, and the opportunity to get away from that one-size-fits-all approach while holding communities accountable is what Ed-Flex is all about. 
   So I think this is an important debate. I said earlier most Americans have no idea what Ed-Flex is all about. I bet a lot of people at this point think Ed-Flex is a guy who is teaching aerobics at the local health club. We are going to have to spend some time talking about this issue to show why it is actually beneficial in the real world in terms of serving poor kids and meeting the needs of the communities. I think we can do that. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor. 
   Mr. REED addressed the Chair.

   Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, as we speak, rescue crews are fighting valiantly to contain the damage from the wreck of the tanker New Carissa off of Coos Bay, Oregon three weeks ago. But the clock is ticking, the water is rising, and time is running short. An environmental disaster of truly alarming proportions is staring my state in the face. 
   Thousands of gallons of fuel oil have already leaked out of the wrecked ship and thousands more may be spilled along our precious coastline within days, if not hours. 
   As Oregonians struggle to make the best of a bad situation, it is not too early to start talking about how we prevent the next addition to the legacy of New Carissa. It seems clear to me that we need to look at the pernicious practice of foreign flagging. How many gallons of oil need to spill and how many miles of coastline have to be destroyed before we stop allowing unseaworthy vessels manned by untrained crews into our coastal waters. 
   It seems easier to register a supertanker in some foreign countries than it is to register an automobile in Portland, Oregon. As long as this so-called Flag of Convenience system continues, it's only a matter of time before the next New Carissa runs aground on a local beach. Yet our maritime policy continues to allow it. 
   Grave concerns have also been raised about the amount and quality of information being released to the public about this disaster. People who live in the area simply have not been told what to expect. That is unacceptable. When disaster strikes, government has an ironclad responsibility to give people as much information as possible. 
   Today, I am introducing legislation that focuses on avoiding disasters like the New Carissa. We need to stop playing Russian roulette with our coastal resources and the communities that depend on them. 
   Congressman DEFAZIO has authored companion legislation in the House of Representatives, which was adopted as an amendment to the Coast Guard Reauthorization Bill. 
   This legislation requires all vessels, foreign and domestic, to notify the Coast Guard when they intend to enter our country's territorial waters, allows the Coast Guard to bar them from entry if there are safety concerns, and gives the Coast Guard the authority to direct the movements of such vessels in our waters in hazardous situations. This bill would have given the Coast Guard the ability to block the New Carissa from allowing its deadly course of sailing so close to shore during a hazardous gale, a practice that local pilots shun. 
   In other words, had this bill been in place, the Coast Guard would have had the ability to stop this tragedy before it occurred, instead of having to clean up after it.

   Mr. WYDEN. Mr. Chief Justice, our leaders, Senators LOTT and DASCHLE, my colleagues, my friends. 
   I doubt that I will ever know what the President of the United States was up to when he lied to Betty Currie about the nature of his relationship with Monica Lewinsky. Did the President lie to Ms. Currie because he didn't want her to know the truth about the affair? Did the President lie because he wanted her to defend him to the White House staff? Did the President lie because he wanted her to repeat those lies under oath? I doubt that I am ever going to get the real answer to those questions. 
   But I believe I do know why it has been excruciatingly difficult for the U.S. Senate to get to the bottom of the Currie controversy and several others that we have been wrestling with for weeks now. If I might paraphrase a legal doctrine, this impeachment has become the fruit of a poisonous tree. This impeachment is a deadly plant that has flowered in the toxic soil of partisanship.  
   Given the highly contentious nature of the charges against the President, there is no question in my mind that the congressional leadership should have first established a bipartisan process for investigating the serious allegations. 
   It is my view that had the Founding Fathers decided that the first step in the impeachment process would be taken by the U.S. Senate, I, Senator LOTT and Senator DASCHLE would have produced a truly bipartisan inquiry, and we would have been able to find common ground on several of the key issues. I don't think it would have produced a string of 100-0 votes, but I believe that we would have had a more bipartisan result than what we are going to see at the end of these deliberations. But this process began elsewhere. And I only want to make one comment about the House. 
   In my view, the House didn't even try to locate the common ground. And I use that word ``try'' specifically because it is one thing to work your head off and not be able to bring people together. We have all been there. But that is not what went on in the House. They didn't even try to come together. It has been well documented, for example, that the Speaker of the House and the House minority leader went for months at a time without even talking to each other. I am not going to assign fault to one or the other, but the fact is that by the end of last year, our two major political parties were at war with each other over the allegations against the President. 
   This toxic partisanship is not, in my view, what public service is all about. I am a Democrat, for good reasons; and there are sincere, important differences of philosophy on issues between Senators on the respective sides. But I have always felt doing what is right is more important than adhering to party dogma, and that is what I wanted to do in this matter. 
   The framers of the Constitution tried to give us a heads-up, a warning about how the impeachment process could become unduly partisan. 
   Alexander Hamilton, in Federalist 65, said that the types of crimes for which impeachment is the appropriate remedy are ``political.'' And he added, ``the prosecution of them, for this reason, will seldom fail to agitate the passions of the whole community, and to divide it into parties, more or less friendly, or inimical, to the accused.'' 
   Thomas Jefferson, after almost having been kept from office in a partisan maneuver to replace him with Aaron Burr, set a deeply moving tone for looking beyond partisan confrontation in his first inaugural address. 
   My colleagues and friends, it doesn't have to be all partisan all the time. There is an alternative to slash-and-burn Government. And it is a topic, I regret to say, that I know a fair amount about. 
   I won a very, very bitter Senate campaign against a man I am proud to call my friend, my colleague, Senator GORDON SMITH. Our part of the country had never seen a campaign so relentlessly negative. The whole country was watching the race to succeed Bob Packwood, but our campaign didn't enlighten very many people. It brought out the worst in us. I was so disgusted with it and what I had become, that with only a few short weeks to go in the campaign I got rid of all my ads and basically started over. 
   Shortly after Senator SMITH won his election, we got together and talked about how we regretted the bitter nature of the campaign and what we had become. We decided from that point on we would put the greater good, that of the people of Oregon, before any differences we might have. The New York Times has started to call us the ``odd couple''--a Jew from the city, a Mormon from the country. What kind of odds would you have given for that kind of relationship? But it works. 
   The votes that we are going to cast now are in little doubt. So I wish to express my concern that as the Senate completes its work on impeachment that we have the ability to come back and tackle our other constitutional responsibilities in a bipartisan fashion. 
   The public is tired of us being at each other's throats. They are tired of beltway politics that places toxic partisanship over the public interest. GORDON SMITH and I found out the hard way, and they are right. 
   Perhaps even at this late hour we can find our way to a little miracle and wrap up this impeachment debate through a bipartisan statement that makes it clear that each of us finds the President's conduct repugnant. If we miss that chance, let's keep looking for every possible opportunity to come together. 
   Senator FRIST and I have a bipartisan education bill. No speeches about that now, but every Governor in the country is for it. My point is that this impeachment process has brought us to a critical moment in our history. We can either rise to the occasion by forging new and healthier ways to deal with our differences, or we can sink from the collective weight of a partisan mess that we have all helped to create. 
   In arriving at my decision in this case, I kept coming back to the reality that Congress has not once removed a President, not once in 211 years. The Constitution places the burden for such a grave step very high. Such a showing is not only to protect our Nation from partisan prosecution, but also to impose safeguards that are necessary, given the severity of the potential punishment--a political death penalty, as House Manager LINDSEY GRAHAM said. 
   When I say ``punishment,'' I am not only referring to the punishment imposed on the President, but in particular to the destructive impact of such an action to our Nation as a whole. The House managers did not, in my view, prove their case beyond a reasonable doubt. In my opinion, they didn't get particularly close. 
   As stated earlier, I do find the President's lying to Betty Currie about his relationship with Monica Lewinsky to be very, very disturbing. The House managers have a hunch that the President's intent was criminal. To borrow from House Manager GRAHAM, they think it is likely he was up to no good. My friends, hunches are not impeachable, nor should they be. If the evidence required to convict a President of the United States in an impeachment trial is allowed to be less than that required in a shoplifting trial, the constitutional foundation for the Presidency will disintegrate before our very eyes. That is something that a few future Presidents in this body ought to consider for just a moment. 
   Today I am going to vote to acquit on both counts. But I don't want that to be my final contribution today. 
   I had a lot of farfetched dreams as a boy, but never once did I dream that I could serve with all of you on the floor of the U.S. Senate. My parents fled Nazi Germany, and not all of my family got out. We lost family in Hitler's brutal Kristallnacht. So you might understand how I grew up revering the greatness of America and the institutions of our democracy. 
   I will tell you, I never, ever believed that some skinny fellow with modest oratorical skills and a face for radio--(laughter)--could have a chance to serve in the United States Senate. 
   What I want to be able to tell my grandchildren is that this was the point in American history where we drew a line in the sand and said ``no more'' to the excessive partisanship. A time when we said ``no more'' to a brand of politics that each of us knows is bringing out the worst in good people. We have good leaders in the U.S. Senate--in TRENT LOTT, in TOM DASCHLE--who have shown, in the last month, just how hard they are willing to work to bring us together. 
   My friends, let the toxic partisanship end. Let it end here, and let it end now.

    Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with Senator MCCAIN, the Chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee, and Senators BRYAN and SNOWE in introducing today the Airline Passenger Fairness Act of 1999. The purpose of our legislation is to assure that consumer protections don't end when a passenger pulls into the airport parking lot. Travelers ought to enjoy the same kinds of rights in the air as they do on the ground. But as airline profits have soared in recent years, passenger rights have been left at the gate. 
   We are well aware that legislation cannot resolve every problem air travelers may encounter. Our bill does not impose a federal mandate for fluffier pillows or a Constitutional right to a bigger bag of peanuts, just the right to basic information and the ability for consumers to make decisions for themselves. 
   The Department of Transportation's (DoT) Air Travel Consumer Reports just issued its final tally of consumer complaints for 1998. Consumer complaints about air travel jumped from a total of 7,667 in 1997 to 9,606 last year, an increase of more than 25%. In just three months last year, one airline alone denied boarding to 55,767 passengers. The 10 largest U.S. carriers combined denied boarding to more than 250,300 passengers from July-September 1998. One industry expert estimates that sometimes as many as 130-150% of the seats on a flight are sold. Clearly, all is not well. 
   The price of an airline ticket is one of the great mysteries of modern life. A ticket costs one price when purchased over the phone and another if purchased online, one if purchased in the morning and another three hours later. It practically defies the law of physics. 
   With this bill, we are putting the airlines on notice that business as usual is no longer acceptable for American air travelers. No longer can a passenger be bumped, canceled or overbooked with impunity. 
   Under this bill, consumers will be able to get full information about all the fares on all the flights. Airlines will no longer be able to withhold basic information on air fares, creating confusion and preventing consumers from comparison shopping. It will also make sure that when a consumer pays for a ticket, they can use all or part of it for whatever reason they choose. Airlines will have to inform a ticketed passenger when a flight is overbooked, as well as when the problem is when a flight is canceled, delayed, or diverted. 
   The legislation will work by building on current rules and regulations. Today, the Department of Transportation can investigate ``anti-competitive, unfair or deceptive practices'' by an airline. If the Department finds that an airline has engaged in such practices, DoT can issue civil penalties or take other actions to assure compliance. Our legislation will empower consumers to seek DoT action against carriers that fail to respect the common sense consumer protections spelled out in the bill. 
   To date, DoT has tended to look at this authority primarily on an industry-wide basis, or whether one airline has engaged in an unfair practice against another. Our bill brings this attention down to the consumers' level. It gives the Department the authority to investigate and punish violations of passenger rights. Under our proposal, airlines will no longer be able to deny consumers basic information without paying a price. 
   This bill will also put market forces to work to bring prices down. Today, a traveler cannot get much basic information. Poor information makes for poor decisions; poor decisions prevent the market from operating smoothly and set the stage for higher prices. Just last year, according to one national media report, there were more than a dozen fare hikes, and in late January, the media reported the major U.S. carriers raised leisure fares four percent and business fares two percent. Informed consumers engaging in real comparison shopping will put pressure on the airlines to make fares as low as possible. 
   There's been a lot of talk lately about ``air rage.'' In my view there is no excuse for violent or abusive behavior by anyone. But when people are treated like so many pieces of cargo, it's not surprising that some of them will lash out. One pilot at a major U.S. air carrier said recently: ``What's happening is the industry's own fault. We've got to treat passengers with respect. We've made air travel a very unpleasant experience.'' 
   It's time to make sure air travel works better for everyone. It can if air travelers have the same basic protections as other consumers. The corner grocer cannot sell a customer a product at one price and then sell the next customer in line the same product at a higher price. The neighborhood movie house cannot cancel a show just because only a few people show up. The Airline Passenger Fairness Act will bring similar consumer protections to air travel and ensure that air travelers have the information they need to make informed decisions.

    Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, my colleague from Oregon Senator GORDON SMITH, and I are introducing this legislation today to correct an inequity in the payment formula for Medicare+Choice plans. In states like Oregon, with historically low cost health care systems, these inequities leave many Medicare beneficiaries with few or no choices in their health care services. 
   The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 contained a promise to provide seniors with more choices, but that promise has gone unfulfilled because of these inequities. 
   The legislation that Senator SMITH and I are introducing today will fulfill that promise by fully funding what is known as the ``blend'' portion of the formula used to determine payment rates. The legislation brings parity to areas that have been historically efficient in delivering health care services. Under the current system, the Medicare payment formula has not rewarded these areas for their efficiency and low costs. As a result, beneficiaries in these areas have not received the range of benefits available in areas with less efficient and more costly health care systems. 
   This legislation also assures beneficiaries will no longer be penalized because they live in a rural or low-cost area. We must assure that seniors living in Oregon and other low cost areas receive the full promise of Medicare+Choice. 
   With managed care playing a larger role in Medicare, this bill is needed now more than ever. Nearly 100 plans elected to drop out of the Medicare program for 1999. Many of those plans served seniors in low cost and rural areas, leaving too many beneficiaries not only without choice but also out in the cold. Other managed care plans made benefit changes that limit the promise we all had hoped would occur through Medicare+Choice. 
   We need to make sure that all seniors are included in the Medicare+Choice promise and that managed care plans in Oregon, Iowa and other low-cost areas are no longer penalized because of their historic efficiency. Senator SMITH and I urge our colleagues to support this bill.

    Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, the legislation I introduce today will help the people of the Pacific Northwest address one of the most important natural resource issues in the region: the restoration of our majestic salmon runs. This bill will lend a much-needed hand to Oregonians and other Northwesterners who have been working together to find common sense solutions to preserve this precious natural resource. 
   As many people know, any effort to recover these salmon runs must be both creative and comprehensive, due to the complex nature of the salmon life cycle. Salmon are hatched in fresh water, migrate down streams and rivers to the sea to grow and mature, and then return to the streams of their birth to spawn. This complex life cycle exposes the fish to many hazards which threaten their survival. If we are to achieve our goal of restoring salmon runs to healthy levels, we must identify and address the various causes of salmon mortality. 
   One of the hazards facing salmon and other fish is the diversion of water from streams and rivers to irrigate agricultural crops. Migrating juvenile fish, including endangered salmon and bull trout, are killed when they are diverted from rivers and streams along with water used for irrigation. 
   The common-sense solution to this pervasive problem is to safely screen the points of water diversion: to allow water through while keeping fish out. Despite existing State and Federal programs to assist with the installation of fish screens, unscreened diversions continue to be a significant problem for endangered fish in the Pacific Northwest. 
   My home state of Oregon has identified fish mortality caused by water diversions as a priority problem. One of Oregon's primary goals relating to salmon restoration is to encourage the installation of fish screens and passage devices for water diversions on streams and rivers. Oregon has developed a cooperative program to assist in screening smaller diversions used on family farms. However, the State cannot afford to provide similar assistance for larger sized diversions. That's where the Federal government can help. 
   This bill gives the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers new authority to help irrigators make their water systems safer for fish. Participation by irrigators in the program will be voluntary and will require a sharing of the cost. 
   I believe this legislation will be very effective because irrigators from Oregon and the other Northwest states have told me they want to make their water systems more fish-friendly, but  they need help to do so. This bill will give them the help they need and will greatly benefit the current efforts of local irrigation districts and watershed councils to conserve and protect our fish runs. 
   I am pleased that this legislation is cosponsored by Senator GORDON SMITH and has support from all the Northwest irrigation groups and literally dozens of Northwest and national conservation and sport fishing groups, including National Audubon Society, Natural Resources Defense Council, Oregon Trout, Trout Unlimited, American Rivers, Pacific Coast Federation of Fishermen's Associations, and Northwest Sportfishing Industries Association. 
   Despite our best efforts to restore these salmon runs, they continue to decline year after year. We need a fresh approach to this problem--one that involves the participation of the local folks who are affected by conservation efforts. This bill takes that approach. 
   Of course, a fish screen program alone is not the missing clue to solve our salmon problem. But this program, along with others like the Clean Water bill I introduced last session with Senator BURNS are pieces of the complete puzzle. 
   Ultimately, it will take the integrated efforts of all interests in our region to recover our salmon successfully. State, Tribal and local governments, local watershed councils, private landowners and the Federal government will all need to work together. Initiatives like this fish screen bill will help forge the partnerships upon which successful salmon recovery will be based. I urge your support for this legislation, so that the people of the Pacific Northwest can continue their important work to restore this precious natural resource.

    Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce the Education Flexibility Partnership Act of 1999 with my colleague Senator BILL FRIST of Tennessee. This bill encourages innovation in our schools by expanding the Ed-Flex demonstration program from a handful of states to all states. Mr. President, education dollars should be spent in the classroom, not the front office. That common-sense philosophy is at the heart of an exciting new education program known as education flexibility, or Ed-Flex. 
   In the raging debate over the federal government's role in education, Ed-Flex defines a third-way approach--allowing local schools to receive federal assistance while being freed from the burden of unnecessary, time-consuming Washington resolutions. Local school boards, principals, teachers, and parents have the flexibility to find creative solutions that make sense in their own communities, and are held accountable for achieving real results. Ed-Flex accomplishes this by giving states the authority to grant waivers from federal regulations to individual schools or local education agencies, in exchange for agreeing to meet specific targets for student improvement. 
   In other words, a school that agrees to meet high standards can receive federal aid without having to worry about complying with the hundreds and hundreds of pages of regulations, and filling out the voluminous forms that usually go along with that assistance. Virtually every school district in the country, for example, employs staff whose job is to make sure that the schools are in compliance with rules for the government's Title I program. Ed-Flex could allow school districts to use fewer compliance officers and hire more teachers instead. 
   Ed-Flex is currently being tried as a pilot program in a dozen states around  the country, and the results have been impressive: 
   Oregon community colleges and high schools work together to streamline their vocational education programs. As a result, more students are learning technical skills, such as computer programming, and graduating from high school. 
   The Phelps Luck Elementary School in Howard County, Maryland has used its waiver to provide one-on-one tutoring for reading students who have the greatest need in grades 1-5. They also used their waiver to lower the average student/teacher ratio in mathematics and reading from 25 to 1 to 12 to 1. 
   Achievement scores from Texas, the state which has implemented Ed-Flex most broadly, confirm that Ed-Flex can improve academic performance. After only two years of implementation, preliminary statewide results on the Texas Assessment of Academic Skills show that districts with Ed-Flex waivers outperformed districts that didn't take advantage of the program by a full three points in reading and more than two in math. 
   For African-American students, the gains were even greater. At Westlawn Elementary School in LaMarque, Texas, for example, African-American students improved almost 23% over their 1996 math test scores, after the school put an Ed-Flex waiver into practice. 
   Ed-Flex will help schools raise achievement levels by giving them a powerful weapon to cut through the red tape that sometimes keeps teachers and principals tied up in knots. This frees them up to focus full time on giving children the best possible education. The Ohio Department of Education wrote in an annual report that Ed-Flex helps create an environment which ``encourages creativity, thoughtful planning, and innovation.'' And in Oregon, the nation's first Ed-Flex state, the program has brought ``greater flexibility and better coordination to federal education programs.'' 
   At the heart of all this innovation is accountability. Schools need to demonstrate that what they are doing produces results. If it doesn't, Ed-Flex provides an opportunity to move on to something else that might be more effective. Parents and taxpayers should rightfully demand that schools be responsible for meeting the goals that are set for them. 
   Last year, Senator FRIST and I introduced legislation to expand Ed-Flex nationwide, and broaden its use in the states where it's already in place. With the support of a bipartisan group of 21 cosponsors, the bill passed almost unanimously through the Senate Labor Committee. In the House, Representatives CASTLE and ROEMER introduced a companion bill with 25 cosponsors. Unfortunately, the bills fell victim to legislative gridlock at the end of the 105th Congress. But today, at the beginning of the 106th Congress, we are reintroducing the bill with an eye toward its passage. The National Governors' Association has made expansion of Ed-Flex a top priority, and both President Clinton and Education Secretary Riley have announced their support for Ed-Flex. The time for action is near. 
   Every hour school officials spend filling out a government form is an hour that could be spent giving special attention to a child. Every dollar spent on complying with unproductive mandates from Washington, DC, is a dollar that could be spent on something that works. With a good education more important than ever, and confidence in our schools at an all-time low, it's time to try something different. Flexibility and accountability can be the key to a brighter future. Congress should expand Ed-Flex, and allow a flurry of creativity across our entire country to give our children a brighter future.

   Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, today I introduce a measure to bring critically needed relief to Marina Khalina and her son, Albert Miftakhov, who suffers from cerebral palsy. Marina and Albert are Russian immigrants who have made a new home for themselves in the state of Oregon. They love their new life in America, but they face deportation unless Congress steps in and helps them become citizens of this country. 
   Marina and Albert have been valuable members of their community in Oregon and would make model citizens. They are both people of exceptional moral character. Neither has been arrested or convicted of any crime. Although Albert often has had to miss school for medical operations, therapy, and other treatments, he consistently has been a good student. Marina has worked tirelessly in the United States to support her family and to cover her son's staggering medical costs, which will include additional surgery in the future. Through hard work, determination, and courage, Marina has made sure that Albert receives the medical care he requires. 
   Forcibly removing them and sending them back to Russia would result in extreme hardship for both of them and would make it virtually impossible for Albert to receive proper medical attention. Albert would be unable to lead a normal life due to the current inability of Russian society to understand and accommodate disabled persons. Even the most basic medical treatment, surgical intervention and physical therapy would be either unavailable or extremely difficult to obtain in Russia. 
   Although life has not been easy for Marina and Albert, they have both shown bravery in the face of adversity. This bill will allow Marina and Albert to stay in the United States so that Albert can receive the care he needs to lead a normal life. I urge you to support this legislation.

   Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, twenty-five years after enactment of the Clean Water Act, we still have not achieved the law's original goal that all our nation's lakes, rivers and streams would be safe for fishing and swimming. 
   After 25 years, it's time for the next generation of strategies to solve our remaining water quality problems. We need to give States new tools to overcome the new water quality challenges they are now facing. 
   The money that has been invested in controlling water pollution from factories and upgrading sewage treatment plants has gone a long way to controlling these urban pollution sources. In most cases, the remaining water quality problems are no longer caused by pollution spewing out of factory pipes. Instead, they are caused by runoff from a myriad of sources ranging from farm fields to city streets and parking lots. 
   In my home State of Oregon, more than half of our streams don't fully meet water quality standards. And the largest problems are contamination form runoff and meeting the standards for water temperatures. 
   In many cases, conventional approaches will not solve these problems. But we can achieve water temperature standards and obtain other water quality benefits by enhancing stream flows and improving runoff controls. 
   A major problem for many streams in Oregon and in many other areas of the Western United States is that water supplies are fully appropriated or over-appropriated. There is currently no extra water to spare for increased stream flows. 
   We can't create new water to fill the gap. But we can make more water available for this use through increased water conservation and more efficient use of existing water supplies. 
   The key to achieving this would be to create incentives to reduce wasteful water use. 
   In the Western United States, irrigated agriculture is the single largest user of water. Studies indicate that substantial quantities of water diverted for irrigation do not make it to the fields, with a significant portion lost to evaporation or leakage fro irrigation canals. 
   In Oregon and other States that recognize rights to conserved water for those who conserve it, irrigators and other water users could gain rights to use conserved water while also increasing the amount of water available for other uses by implementing conservation and efficiency measures to reduce water loss. 
   The Federal government can play a role in helping meet our nation's changing water needs. In many Western States, supply problems can be addressed by providing financial incentives to help water users implement cost effective water conservation and efficiency measures consistent with State water law. 
   And, we can improve water quality throughout the nation by giving greater flexibility to States to use Clean Water Act funds to control polluted runoff, if that's where the money is needed most. 
   Today, I am pleased to be joined by my colleague, Senator BURNS, in introducing legislation to authorize the Clean Water State Revolving Fund program to provide loans to water users to fund conservation measures or runoff controls. States would be authorized, but not required, to use their SRF funds for these purposes. Participation by water users, farmers, ranchers and other eligible loan recipients would also be entirely voluntary. 
   The conservation program would be structured to allow participating users to receive a share of the water saved through conservation or more efficient use, which they could use in accordance with State law. This type of approach would create a win/win situation with more water available for both the conservers and for instream flows. And, by using the SRF program, the Federal seed money would be repaid over time and gradually become available to fund conservation or other measures to solve water quality problems in other areas. 
   My proposal has the support of the Farm Bureau, Oregon water users, the Environmental Defense Fund and the Oregon Water Trust. 
   I urge my colleagues to support giving States greater flexibility to use their Clean Water funds for water conservation or runoff control when the State decides that is the best way to solve water quality problems and the water users voluntarily agree to participate.
