 Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, on October 9, 1998, the Senate, by a vote of 98-0, passed the International Religious Freedom Act. As the sponsor of the International Religious Freedom Act, I am providing this statement which gives some guidance as to what I tried to accomplish in crafting this Act. 
Background 
With enactment of the International Religious Freedom Act, there will be a major increase in the amount of information on the nature and extent of violations of religious freedom in foreign countries, in the actions taken by the U.S. government in response to those violations and in the scrutiny of the steps taken by the U.S. government to combat them. Sadly, events around the world demonstrate the need for the International Religious Freedom Act. 
It has been reported that more than half of the world's population lives under governments that place restrictions or outright prohibitions on the ability to practice one's religion. While the end of the Cold War saw a significant increase in religious freedom in many countries, in others there has been no change. Totalitarian governments either continue to stamp out religion or subject it to state controls through arrest, torture, beatings, imprisonment and unemployment. 
One such government has used massacre, starvation, and forced resettlement as a tool in the effort to crush resistance in its mostly Christian region. There have been reports of the crucifixion of Christians, although these reports cannot be confirmed. What has been confirmed is the revival of slavery, abduction and mutilation. Displaced refugees have been confronted with forced conversion or starvation. 
In other countries, reports abound of attacks by extremists or by government forces on Christians, and on their homes, businesses, and churches. Converts to Christianity are imprisoned and tortured. In several countries no overt practice of any religion but the state religion is permitted, and conversion is illegal. These prohibitions affect virtually every religion around the world. 
The International Religious Freedom Act 
This is the backdrop which led to the International Religious Freedom Act. The International Religious Freedom Act was crafted with four core principles. First, the International Religious Freedom Act is comprehensive both in the scope of covered violations, and in the full range of tools it provides to address the violations. By crafting a definition of violations of religious freedom that focuses on the most common types of violations as well as the most egregious, the Act attempts to resolve the problem before these violations escalate into torture, imprisonment and even death. 
Second, the International Religious Freedom Act was crafted to require action while preserving necessary flexibility for the President. The International Religious Freedom Act contains a menu of options, including eight diplomatic and seven economic measures, from which the President must choose for each country that engages in violations of religious freedom. The Act also allows the President to calibrate any economic measure. The President can, for instance, suspend or limit foreign assistance, rather than cut it off entirely. The Act gives the President an additional option of taking commensurate action for any of the 15 options if the President determines that by doing so he can further the policy of the United States set forth in this Act. Finally, the President can exercise a waiver if important national interests require it, or if it would be harmful to those the Act seeks to help. 
The provisions of the International Religious Freedom Act give the President economic and diplomatic tools to use that will best fit the situation and most appropriately deal with the problem. These tools can be modified based on the level of persecution in the country, the country engaging in the persecution and our relationship with that country. This flexibility ensures that the International Religious Freedom Act will be more effective. The goal of the International Religious Freedom Act is not to punish countries but to change behavior. 
Third, the International Religious Freedom Act promotes long-term change through several means, including comprehensive human rights and religious freedom training for U.S. officials and representatives, both in the Foreign Service and in the Immigration and Naturalization Service. The Act authorizes U.S. assistance for the development of legal protections abroad, broadcasting and scholarly exchanges to promote religious freedom, and awards for meritorious Foreign Service Officers. 
Fourth, the International Religious Freedom Act establishes several positions to ensure a permanent profile on and attention to religious freedom. It establishes an Ambassador at Large for International Religious Freedom which is a permanent diplomatic position to spearhead U.S. advocacy for religious freedom internationally. The Act also establishes a Commission for International Religious Freedom to ensure accountability, and to provide independent policy recommendations as the Act is implemented. The Annual Report further provides accountability by reporting the actions of the U.S. government. 
The following is a commentary on several sections of the International Religious Freedom Act.  
Section 101. Ambassador-at-Large for Religious Liberty: This section creates a high-profile diplomat under the Secretary of State, vested with the authority to continually and forcefully raise the issue of religious persecution in bilateral and multilateral forums. The Ambassador is responsible for ensuring advocacy for, and high-quality reporting on, religious freedom by American Embassies around the world. The Ambassador also is to make policy recommendations to the President and the Secretary of State to advance the right to religious freedom abroad. 
Section 102. Reporting: This section strengthens existing reporting requirements. The Ambassador is to assist in the preparation of the sections on religious freedom in the State Department Human Rights Country Reports, and embassy personnel are directed to seek out and investigate reports of violations of religious freedom. 
This section also creates an Annual Report on International Religious Freedom. This report details the status of religious freedom in each country around the world, and provides a comprehensive accounting of the violations of religious freedom, how severe they are and where they occur. The report is to give an indication of trends towards improvements in protecting religious liberty, and trends toward the deterioration of that protection. The report will also include information regarding U.S. government actions taken to promote religious freedom abroad. The U.S. government, when compiling this report, must work with non-governmental organizations (NGOs), when appropriate, to ensure that each report contains the most accurate information. 
The Annual Report must also include information on the forced conversion of minor U.S. citizens living abroad. It has come to my attention that our government has done little to resolve cases of the victimization of minors who have been taken to a foreign land, subjected to forced religious conversion, and prevented under the laws of those nations from returning to the United States where they would enjoy religious freedom. 
In some cases, especially for girls, this amounts to a life sentence of living abroad. In some countries, women may not travel abroad without the permission of their father or husband. The State Department should work to secure the rights of its citizens--including those living abroad, and the Commission on International Religious Freedom should monitor these cases. 
Each year, the Secretary of State, working with the Ambassador, must present this report to Congress by September 1. An Executive Summary highlighting the countries of greatest concern with regard to religious freedom and countries demonstrating significant improvement in the protection of that right is to accompany the report. A classified, more detailed addendum may be provided to Congress. 
Section 103. Internet Site for Religious Liberty: To assist NGOs around the world, the Act establishes a State Department Internet site posting the Annual Report, the Executive Summary and other international documents on religious freedom. 
Section 104. Religious Freedom Training: To ensure awareness by Foreign Service officers of the nature and scope of violations of religious freedom, the Act amends the Foreign Service Act of 1980 to require training in human rights, including violations of religious freedom, as standard training for Foreign Service officers. Training is mandatory for officers with reporting responsibilities and for Chiefs of Mission. 
Section 105 & 106. Contacts with NGOs: Embassies are required to seek out religious NGOs and meet with imprisoned religious leaders where appropriate and beneficial. These contacts will not only help our government gather the facts accurately as it prepares the Annual Report, but also will prove valuable as our government seeks to formulate policies to promote religious freedom around the world, as described in section 403. A Sense of the Congress directs embassies to craft a strategy for the promotion of religious liberty. 
Section 107. Equal Access to U.S. Embassies: The Act grants access to U.S. citizens (and, at the embassy's discretion, to nationals) to U.S. missions abroad for religious activities on a basis no less favorable than for other nongovernmental activities unrelated to the conduct of the diplomatic mission. For instance, it is inconsistent that permission be granted by U.S. missions to allow the dispensing and social consumption of alcoholic beverages and the serving of pork products, contrary to local law, while discouraging such permission for holding religious services. The fact that several other foreign consulates afford access to worship for their citizens disproves the suggestion that diplomatic interests preclude similar provision for Americans by the State Department. Many other social and American community activities without discernable diplomatic purpose will no doubt continue, and in most cases should continue. Religious service access requests under section 107 may receive no less consideration than these other activities occurring on U.S. mission premises. 
Section 108. Prisoner Database and Issue Briefs: To prompt advocacy at every possible opportunity, the bill directs the State Department to maintain country-specific lists of religious prisoners and issue briefs on policies restricting religious liberty, to be provided to executive branch and Congressional leaders for use in meetings with foreign dignitaries. In compiling these lists, the Act gives the Secretary of State the discretion to decide whether including a name on the list harms or helps the prisoner. 
Sections 201 to 206. The International Religious Freedom Act establishes a United States Commission on International Religious Freedom. This Commission, which is bipartisan in composition and will include both presidential and Congressional appointees, will ensure that the President and the Congress receive independent recommendations--and where necessary, criticism--of American policy in support of international religious freedom. 
The Commission consists of 10 persons (including the Ambassador at Large, who sits as an ex officio, non-voting member), chosen for a period of two years; the Commission sunsets in four years unless reauthorized. The innovative appointment structure established in this Act ensures that five commissioners will be selected by the President's political party and four commissioners by the other political party, no matter which political party controls the White House or either house of Congress. While this Act appropriately defers to the President's constitutional authority in conducting policy toward foreign states, it is the intent of Congress that the Commission hold policy makers accountable to the purposes of this Act, and, thus, ensure the Act's effectiveness. 
The Commission will review the ongoing facts and circumstances of violations of religious freedom (both from government reports and from other sources) and make policy recommendations. While the Commission's annual report on May 1 will stand as its main formal duty under the sequence of requirements established by the Act, it is the intent of Congress that the Commission be diligent in monitoring violations of religious freedom on an ongoing basis and make its policy recommendations on a timely basis and with an urgency and specificity appropriate to circumstances. 
Section 301. This section is a Sense of the Congress that there should be at the National Security Council a Special Advisor on International Religious Freedom, who monitors persecution and serves as a resource and policy advisor for executive branch officials.

Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, in my floor remarks preceding the passage of the International Religious Freedom Act of 1998 on October 9, 1998, I recognized three persons for their many hours of work and their important leadership roles in guiding this legislation to passage--Steve Moffitt of my staff, John Hanford on the staff of Senator Richard Lugar, and Cecile Shea with Senator Joseph Leiberman. 
I would like to take this opportunity to add to this honor roll the names of several additional congressional staff whose efforts were essential to the crafting and historic passage of this legislation. Often when legislation is passed into law, we, who work in Congress, never have the full benefit of seeing the aid and blessing which our efforts bring to others. This will assuredly be the case for this small group of staff who worked with such dedication and excellence for the passage of the International Religious Freedom Act. Their work has now received the unanimous acclaim of both Houses of Congress, as the Senate voted 98-0 in favor of this bill, followed the next day by a unanimous voice vote in the House. But, more importantly, I hope that these individuals will rest in the satisfaction that their selfless efforts will, for decades to come, redound to the benefit of countless persons around the world imprisoned, tortured, or otherwise persecuted or restricted in the practice of their religious beliefs. This is an extraordinary and noble service which they have rendered to persons of faith throughout the world, and I believe that it is important that we, as a congressional body, recognize their role in this historic achievement. 
First, I wish to recognize two House staff members for their brilliant and tireless work, beginning at the very inception of the International Religious Freedom Act and carrying all the way through to its final passage. Laura Bryant of the office of Congressman Bob Clement and William Inboden, formerly with Congressman Tom DeLay, were two of the original `visionaries' for this bill, and their compassion for suffering believers as well as their expertise on issues of religious persecution are reflected on every page of the bill. I am deeply grateful for their extraordinary contribution to this landmark legislation. 
In the Senate, I wish to express special commendation to Jim Jatras, Foreign Affairs Specialist with the Republican Policy Committee. Mr. Jatras is one of the most distinguished analysts of foreign policy on Capitol Hill and is a person to whom I have often turned for expert counsel. In the case of the International Religious Freedom Act, Mr. Jatras contributed vitally, both to the substance of the bill and to the process of negotiation which led to its passage. 
I wish, also, to express warmest thanks to Elaine Petty, with the staff of Senator Connie Mack, who was a leading original cosponsor of this act. Ms. Petty contributed many hours of work over the past 6 months toward the passage of this bill, and her efforts were especially important in discussions with other Senate offices and outside groups. 
Special commendation is reserved for the remarkable expertise demonstrated by Art Rynearson, Senior Counsel with the Office of Senate Legislative Counsel. Mr. Rynearson labored through numerous drafts of this bill, and distinguished himself by his command of the process of legislative drafting, by his patience and perseverance, and by his commitment to excellence in creation of U.S. law. The Senate staffers which worked most closely with him have expressed deep gratitude for his spirit of teamwork on this year-long endeavor. 
In addition, I wish to express gratitude to Polly Craighill, who also serves on the staff of Senate Legislative Counsel. Ms. Craighill stepped in at a critical moment in the development of this act and provided expert assistance requiring personal sacrifice on her part. 
Finally, I would like to recognize the important contributions made by several of the senior staff at Congressional Research Service. Larry Eig, Legislative Attorney, Joyce Vialet, Refugee Affairs Expert, Vita Bite, Foreign Affairs Expert, Jeanne Grimmet, Legislative Attorney, and Dianne Rennack, Foreign Affairs Expert, all made important contributions to the careful work of researching and scrutinizing issues involved in the content of this bill.

Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I wish to speak on the nomination of Dr. Jane Henney to be Commissioner of FDA. 
Mr. President, the nomination of the FDA commissioner is one of the most important nominations the Senate has considered this year. The FDA regulates products comprising twenty-five cents of every dollar spent by consumers in this country. It deals with literally life and death issues on a daily basis. Given the significant impact the FDA has on the life of every American, it is important that the Senate exercise caution to ensure the next Commissioner is qualified and capable of leading the Agency. 
I have let Dr. Henney know, and I let Secretary Shalala know, that I had some concern with FDA as it has been administered for the last few years. The FDA should be a non-partisan science based Agency which focuses solely on its mission to ensure the safety of food and to expeditiously review drugs and medical devices which are intended to save and extend lives. And for this reason I felt I needed personal assurance from Dr. Henney that under her leadership the FDA would focus on its Congressionally mandated mission. 
FDA is supposed to be an agency that works to improve our health, that works to make sure that drugs and other medical devices are safe and effective. What we have found, under Dr. Kessler's regime, particularly during the Clinton administration, was that the FDA was involved in a lot of political activity. Under the leadership of David Kessler, the Agency too often became a tool of the Administration to push its liberal political agenda. One area where this was particularly offensive was the FDA's attempt to regulate tobacco. 
Let me give an example of where I believe they exceeded their authority. In my State, just recently--I tell my colleagues, this is going to happen in every State--an FDA talking paper announced that `FDA Partners With Oklahoma To Protect Children From Tobacco.'  
The Food and Drug Administration has contracted with the Oklahoma State Dept. of Health to enforce the FDA's new regulation that prohibits retailers from selling cigarettes and smokeless tobacco to children under 18. 
I will go on: 
Under the contract, the State of Oklahoma will receive [$312,000] to conduct approximately 4,500 unannounced retail compliance checks over the next 12 months. 
It goes on: 
The FDA will seek a fine of $250 for the second violation, $1,500 for the third [violation], $5,000 for the fourth, and $10,000 for the fifth. 
So, if a convenience store doesn't comply and they don't check IDs--and they have to check IDs up to age 27. In Oklahoma, it is legal to smoke when you are 18--but if a youngster, who is maybe 19, working in a convenience store, doesn't check somebody's identification who might be 26 or 27 years old, they can be fined up to $10,000. Somebody might say, `Where is this idea originating? It is legal for them to smoke, but if they don't check IDs of somebody up to age 27 they can be fined $10,000?' 
This is implementing FDA's regulation. FDA's regulation, in my opinion, is unconstitutional. They don't have the authority to write the law. 
The Constitution says in article I, section 1: 
All legislative Powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress of the United States, which shall consist of a Senate and House of Representatives. 
Where did this regulation come from? It came from FDA, and it came from the FDA Administrator, working with the Clinton administration, to basically implement a very, I think, political agenda. I might mention that the regulations are being contested in court, and most of those regulations are being thrown out. In fact, on August 14, 1998, the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that Congress did not intend to give the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) the authority to regulate tobacco. In a 2-1 decision the Appeals Court tossed out a 1997 federal district court ruling that gave FDA only limited power to regulate tobacco. `The FDA has exceeded the authority granted to it by Congress.' So said Circuit Judge H. Emory Widener Jr., on behalf of the three-member panel. 
I happen to favor regulation on tobacco, but I think Congress needs to act on it. The FDA does not have the authority to create it out of whole cloth, which is certainly what they did. I favor some decent regulations. I don't favor the idea of having a team of people making 4,500 unannounced retail compliance checks all over my State and the Federal Government spending over $300,000 implementing this type of plan, or having the regs be so ridiculous we are going to be checking IDs up to age 27. I don t support regulations that allow the FDA to fine people and businesses who don't comply, up to $10,000 per violation, basically, fining them out of existence. That doesn't make sense.

Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, another area where I have seen FDA become very involved in the political arena deals with the abortion drug RU-486. I have a press release that is dated May 16, 1994. The headline is: `Roussel Uclaf Donates U.S. Patent Rights for RU-486 to Population Council.' 
The first paragraph says: 
</TEXT>
</DOC>

<DOC>
<DOCNO>105-nickles-ok-3-19981020</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, this is an administration that had FDA go out and recruit a company that manufactures RU-486, a French company, to donate its patent rights to a group which is an abortion proponent in the United States and then was doing everything they could to expedite the process. 
RU-486 is an abortion pill which terminates the life of a human embryo between FOUR weeks and NINE weeks. It is NOT a contraceptive as some would have us believe. It is a drug which will stop the beating heart of an unborn child. 
In January 1993, President Clinton issued a memo to Sec. Shalala directing her to promptly `assess initiatives by which HHS can promote the testing and manufacturing of RU-486 in the US.' 
Thereafter, the FDA engaged in negotiations with Roussel Uclaf, French manufacturer and holder of US Patent rights, regarding the testing and marketing of RU-486 in the US. 
In May 1994, Shalala issued this press release, I mentioned, announcing the deal and promising FDA would do everything it could to `quickly evaluate the drug.' FDA pushed the drug through the review process in a fraction of time required for most drugs. 
FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research reported that the median total review time for new drug applications in 1996 was 14.8 months. FDA review time for RU-486 was only 6 months. 
At a time when the agency was struggling to approve drugs which cure diseases and save lives, the Agency was focusing a great deal of time and effort on a political agenda which would end the life of an unborn child. 
I am offended by that, and I asked Dr. Henney: 
Are you going to be promoting an abortion drug? Is that what an FDA Commissioner is supposed to do? Is that their purpose? 
I thought the purpose of FDA was to make sure drugs were safe and effective and that medical devices are safe and effective so people can have some confidence in these products. I didn't know it was the purpose of FDA to recruit companies to bring abortion drugs to into this country. That is clearly not their purpose.

<DOCNO>105-nickles-ok-4-19981020</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, the concluding sentence of her letter says: 
If I am confirmed as Commissioner, I would not solicit a manufacturer for RU-486. 
She also says: 
As a general matter, I believe the Agency should only solicit product applications in extraordinary circumstances in which there is a clear public health need. 
Certainly trying to recruit a manufacturer and provider of abortion drugs doesn't fit in that category, and I appreciate her statement she will not solicit a manufacturer of RU-486. 
It bothers me that the Secretary of Health and Human Services and this Clinton administration have done so much to circumvent the process, to use FDA in the process. I think it is politicizing an agency that is supposed to be focused on its mission to protect the public health and to expeditiously review drugs and medical devices that will save and extend life. 
Mr. President, I also met with Secretary Shalala a couple of times and wanted assurances from her that the Department of Health and Human Services would interpret the law as written, would enforce the law as written and not try to rewrite it. 
Unfortunately, we found out that the Department of Health and Human Services was trying to redefine the Hyde amendment which Congress defined. They were trying to redefine it to broaden the exceptions. 
The Hyde amendment, as most of my colleagues know, says we will not have Federal funding for abortion except for in cases of rape, incest or to save the life of the mother. There is not a mental health exemption in that. Many people have tried to put it in. The administration has. But we clearly defined it, Congress defined it as the Hyde amendment, no mental health exception. 
I have a letter from Secretary Shalala that says this activity will cease and they will interpret the Hyde amendment as written. 
We also found, Mr. President, that under the Kidcare Program HHS had misinterpreted the abortion language. We made it very clear in three different sections in that law that abortion was not going to be a fringe benefit which we were going to provide for teenagers. We made the language very, very clear. 
Much to my consternation, we were contacted by officials of the State of Virginia who said HHS was trying to mandate that they have abortion services covered even though it was certainly their wish and option that they didn't want that to be the case. 
After meeting with Secretary Shalala, and after an exchange of several letters, she finally assured me that wasn't the case. I will insert her letters and mine and Representative Bliley's letter into the Record. But we now have assurances from Secretary Shalala. I will read the last part of her letter sent to me on October 15:  
States are not required to provide abortion services, including abortion services for which coverage is permissible under title XXI of the Social Security Act, under any of the S-CHIP-- 
That is the State Children's Health Insurance Program-- benefit package options in section 2103. No State will be denied approval of its S-CHIP plan because its benefit package under section 2103 does not include coverage of abortion services, including abortion services for which coverage is permissible under title XXI. 
Thank you for your interest in this matter. 
I am pleased that Secretary Shalala agreed with us that she would interpret the law as written, and that includes both the Hyde language and language in the Kidcare program dealing with abortion. I am pleased that I have assurances from Dr. Henney that if she is confirmed Commissioner of FDA, she will not recruit manufacturers and providers for an abortion drug, including RU-486.

Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, it is my intent to support the nomination of Dr. Henney. After meeting with her a couple of times, and having discussions on these and other issues, I am confident that she will be a very able administrator who will not play politics. In my opinion, she doesn't have a political agenda, and I believe she will try to administer the Food and Drug Administration as a professional organization to make sure that drugs and medical devices are safe and effective for America's population, and that she won't try to implement legislation through regulation.

Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Texas. I want to make a couple of comments in regard to the legislation that my colleague and friend, Senator Wyden, alluded to dealing with assisted suicide. 
Mr. President, I introduced legislation to correct a mistake that Attorney General Reno made in June of this year when she overruled the Drug Enforcement Act and its interpretation that controlled substances could not be used for assisted suicide. 
Let me make sure that everybody understands the picture of this. The Controlled Substance Act is a Federal law. It is not a State law; it is a Federal law. It is a Federal law that controls very strong drugs--drugs that are illegal, drugs that can kill, drugs that are very addictive. They are controlled by Federal law. They can't be used except for legitimate medical purposes. That is what is defined in the Federal law in the Controlled Substance Act. They can only be used for legitimate medical purposes. 
What constitutes a legitimate medical purpose? History has it that a legitimate medical purpose is, or can be, the alleviation of pain, to reduce pain, give comfort. It can be used for palliative care, but it is never--let me restate this--the Drug Enforcement Agency, which is in charge of enforcing this act, has never been used for assisted suicide. These drugs are strong drugs. If they are abused, used in heavy quantities, they kill people. 
Unfortunately, some people want to use these drugs for assisted suicide. The Drug Enforcement Administrator, Mr. Constantine, a year ago, in November, wrote a letter to Congress and said that assisted suicide is not a legitimate medical purpose.

Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, the letter says they have reviewed it, and assisted suicide is never a legitimate medical purpose. These drugs can only be used for a legitimate medical purpose. 
The State of Oregon, by referendum, passed a law that says assisted suicide is OK. They had a couple of them. The State of Oregon can do what it wants, but that doesn't overturn Federal law. What if the State of Massachusetts said they were going to legalize heroin? That is a controlled substance. Does that make it legal? No. There is a reason why we have a Federal law dealing with these very strong drugs, and it is called the Controlled Substance Act. And just because one State has a referendum or petition or the legislature passes a bill, it doesn't overturn Federal drug law, period. 
For some unknown reason, the Attorney General--and I 
still don't know why--gave one of the most absurd rulings in June, where she said, well, we still believe we have control of the Federal Controlled Substance Act, so assisted suicide is illegal for some States, except for those which have legalized it. Now, that is an absurd conclusion. I guess if you take that to its conclusion, any State can do whatever they want on these substances. That is absurd. Why have a Federal law? Why have a Federal law in any way, shape, or form. 
Now we have several States--and Oregon is the pioneer in this--like Michigan and other States that are saying they want assisted suicide. I just beg to differ. I don't think that should be the purpose. The whole purpose of these drugs is to alleviate pain. For those organizations that say we are not sure if we support this bill because maybe it would have a chilling impact on pain, that is false. They haven't read the bill. If they want us to help write it in a stronger way--we put very clearly in the bill that these drugs can be used to alleviate pain. We encourage use of these drugs for the alleviation of pain, for palliative care. But they are licensed by the Federal Government and should not be used to kill people. They should not be used for assisted suicide. These are federally controlled drugs. 
Are we going to give that kind of license? What happens if somebody does it? Tradition has it and history has had it that the Drug Enforcement Agency, if somebody misuses these drugs--one, they have to get a Federal license to distribute the drug, and if they misuse them, they lose that license. I think it is only appropriate to do so. They should not have the ability to distribute these drugs if they are going to use these drugs for assisted suicide. 
So I say to my colleagues and anybody who has an interest in this that I want to work this out. I met with the Secretary of Health and Human Services today, Secretary Shalala, and we talked about this. We need to make sure that these drugs can be used for palliative care. We also need to make sure that they are controlled by the Federal Government. They should not be used for assisted suicide. 
Mr. President, let me make a couple of general comments. This is about this administration, and it is about life in general, or maybe their lack of respect for life. 
On two or three issues, I think this administration seems quite bent on devaluating life. I am talking about unborn children, where the administration has been eagerly trying to bring forth the distribution of RU486, an abortion pill that aborts fetuses up to 9 or 10 weeks, where there is a beating heart; they want to legalize that. There wasn't a pharmaceutical company in the country that wanted to make the drug, and the administration bent over backwards trying to recruit this drug coming into the country. 
Now, you find the administration, through the Attorney General, coming up with a ruling that is totally contrary to the Drug Enforcement Agency's history of controlling controlled substances and saying, oh, well, we think assisted suicide is OK. Even though the President of the United States says he is against it, his administration and the Attorney General say maybe it is OK if the State says it is even though the drugs are controlled by the Federal Government. So you have the administration recruiting people to bring in abortion drugs for young people--an administration that wants to fund and subsidize abortion for unborn children, and then an administration now that, through the Attorney General's ruling, says we think these drugs that have been controlled by the Federal Government, under Federal law--we think it is OK if States want to legalize the use of these federally controlled drugs for assisted suicide. I don't think that makes sense. 
I think it is pathetic when you think that the Federal Government's purpose should be to protect people, and they are actually trying to bring in drugs that will kill unborn children. And, then, also at the same time, `Oh, yes. You can use these very strong drugs to kill senior citizens.' It is hard to believe that they would take that position. That is the position of this administration. They are wrong. Hopefully, this Congress will vote. 
I might mention that this is not the first issue that we have had with this. We passed legislation in the last Congress. We passed it unanimously through the Senate. It was my bill, or my language, that said no Federal funds were to be used for assisted suicide. Now we have people saying, `Well, we want to use Federal drugs for assisted suicide.' I think not. 
We are going to vote on it. We are going to have significant debate on it. I look forward to that debate. I regret we are out of time to get a significant debate on it this year. 
I look forward to working with my colleague from Oregon. I understand trying to represent one's State. I believe very strongly in States rights. But I don't believe so strongly in States rights that if the State of Oklahoma wanted to legalize heroin, or other controlled substances--I don't think that supersedes Federal law. 
I would tell my colleague from Oregon that if the State of Oklahoma said, `We think we want to legalize assisted suicide and have it be public,' I say that is fine, you can do it with any drug that is controlled by the State, but not drugs controlled by the Federal Government, because we don't want Federal Government policy to be that we are going to basically acquiesce in assisted suicide. That should not be Federal policy. 
Again, there is a Federal Controlled Substance Act. It is not State. The State could do whatever they want. But not with Federal law, not with Federal drugs, not with the Federal Drug Enforcement Administration, which controls the licenses and controls the use of these substances. The act is written OK. The act says these substances can only be used for legitimate medical purposes. I agree with that. If anybody thinks that legitimate medical purpose is assisted suicide, I disagree with that. That is not in the law. The Attorney General's reading of the law is totally contrary to that of the Drug Enforcement Administration. I believe she is wrong. 
We will give all Members of this body a chance to vote on it in the not-too-distant future--if not this Congress, certainly the next Congress. 
I thank my colleagues, particular my colleague from Texas, for allowing me to proceed to respond to my colleague from Oregon. 
I yield the floor. U.S. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE, 
Drug Enforcement Administration, Washington, DC, November 5, 1997. 
Hon. Henry J. Hyde, House of Representatives, Washington, DC.  
Dear Congressman Hyde: Thank you for your letter of July 29, 1997. In that letter, you requested the Drug Enforcement Administration's (DEA) view as to `whether delivering, distributing, dispensing, prescribing, filling a prescription, or administering a controlled substance with the deliberate intent of assisting in a suicide would violate the Controlled Substance Act (CSA), applicable regulations, rulings, or other federal law subject to DEA enforcement, notwithstanding the enactment of a state law such as Oregon's Measure 16 which rescinds state penalties against such prescriptions for patients with a life expectancy of less than six months.' 
I apologize for the delay in responding to you. As you know, the CSA authorizes DEA to revoke the registration of physicians who dispense controlled substances without a legitimate medical purpose. Historically, DEA's experience with the phrase `without a legitimate medical purpose' has focused on cases involving physicians who have provided controlled substances to drug addicts and abusers. The application of this phrase to cases involving physician-assisted suicide presented DEA with a new issue to review. 
Since receiving your inquiry, my staff has carefully reviewed a number of cases, briefs, law review articles and state laws relating to physician-assisted suicide, including the documents referenced in your letter. In addition, my staff has conducted a thorough review of prior administrative cases in which physicians have dispensed controlled substances for other than a `legitimate medical purpose.' Based on that review, we are persuaded that delivering, dispensing or prescribing a controlled substance with the intent of assisting a suicide would not be under any current definition a `legitimate medical purpose.' As a result, the activities that you described in your letter to us would be, in our opinion, a violation of the CSA. 
Because physician-assisted suicide would be a new and different application of the CSA, a number of issues remain unresolved. For example, suspicious or unnatural deaths require a medico-legal investigation. The first priority in such an investigation would be a comprehensive forensic inquiry by a state or local law enforcement agency, which is traditionally supported by the efforts of a medical examiner, forensic pathologist, and/or coroner. At the conclusion of this stage of the inquiry, the evidence often is submitted to a grand jury or similar process for a determination of potential criminal liability of the person who assisted in the death. 
This initial determination as to the cause of death is not DEA's responsibility. Rather, DEA would have to rely on the evidence supplied to us by state and local law enforcement agencies and prosecutors. If the information or evidence presented to DEA indicates that a physician has delivered, distributed, dispensed, prescribed or administered a controlled substance with the deliberate intent of assisting in a suicide, then DEA could initiate revocation proceedings on the grounds that the physician has acted `without a legitimate medical purpose.' 
In addition to moving to revoke a physician's registration for dispensing controlled substances `without a legitimate medical purpose,' please also be aware that the CSA provides a number of other grounds upon which DEA might revoke the registration of a physician who assisted in a suicide. For example, DEA will revoke the registration of any physician whose state license to practice medicine has been revoked for assisting suicide. Similarly, DEA has authority to revoke the registration of any physician whose acts in assisting a suicide result in a conviction under state controlled substances laws. 
DEA must examine the facts on a case-by-case basis to determine whether a physician's actions conflict with the CSA. If the facts indicate that a physician has acted as set forth in your letter, however, then DEA would have a statutory basis to initiate revocation proceedings. 
I trust that this response addresses your inquiry. If you have any further questions, please feel free to contact me. 
Sincerely, 
Thomas A. Constantine, Administrator.  
Mr. GRAMM addressed the Chair.

Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I compliment my colleagues on their fine remarks about our colleague, Senator Bumpers. I already made a speech complimenting him for his service to the Senate. I noticed my speech had several things in common with the speech of Senator Daschle. I alluded to the fact of Senator Bumpers' sense of humor, which all of us have enjoyed, Democrats and Republicans, and I also referred to the fact that he had the longest microphone cord in the Senate. He has used it extensively, and we have all enjoyed that as well.

Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I want to make several comments concerning some of the negotiations that are going forward. I remind my colleagues in the Congress that the Constitution gives the Congress, not the President, the authority and the responsibility to appropriate money, to pass bills. As a matter of fact, article I of the Constitution says: 
All legislative Powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress of the United States. . . . 
Not in the executive branch, in the Congress, in the people's body. 
It also says under article I, section 9: 
No money shall be drawn from the Treasury, but in Consequence of Appropriations made by law. 
Again, made by Congress. I think some people in the administration think that they are Congress now, that they can write appropriations bills. That is not constitutional. The President has his constitutional authority, and if he wants to veto appropriations bills, he has a right to do so. Let him exercise that right. He doesn't have a right to write appropriations bills. 
For some reason, some people have gotten this idea that the administration is an equal partner. They are an equal branch of Government, but we have different functions in Government. The executive branch can submit a budget, they can confer, they can consult, but Congress passes the appropriations bills, and we need to do so. 
Now we have the President making ever-extending demands: `Well, I'm not going to sign that bill if you don't spend so much money.' Fine. Very good. He vetoed the Agriculture Department appropriations bill because he said we didn't spend enough money and didn't spend enough money under the guise of emergency agriculture assistance. 
He requested $2.3 billion for emergency assistance. We appropriated $4.2 billion, and he vetoed it and said, `We want to spend $7 billion.' In a period of a couple of weeks, he more than doubled his demands. He has a right to veto the bill; fine. He doesn't have a right to write the bill. 
Many people in his administration, maybe the President himself, seem to think, `We are going to write the bill; we're just not going to sign it; if they don't give us more money, we are going to shut down the Government.' Fine, he can shut down the Government. 
I stated to the press, and I will state it again, this Congress will pass as many continuing resolutions as necessary, and it may last all year. We may be operating under continuing resolutions all year long. I personally don't have any desire, any intention of funding all of the Presidential requests that are coming down the pike, for which, all of a sudden, he is making demands. I hope that our colleagues will support me in that effort. 
I am not in that big a hurry to get out of town. I heard the President allude to that in a very partisan statement that he made yesterday with Members of Congress: `We need to keep Congress in.' Mr. President, we will stay in. We will pass resolutions continuing Government operations at 1998 levels, this year's levels. We will pass that as long as necessary. 
We passed one for a week. We passed one for 3 days. We may have to pass another one. We may have to pass it for the balance of this year, maybe into next year, whatever is necessary. But I do not intend on being held hostage. The President said, `Well, give me more money; I want to spend the surplus, whether it be for education, whether it be for Head Start.' He has a whole laundry list. He calls them investments, but, frankly, they are a lot of new social spending. I don't have any desire to spend that money. 
I am quite happy and willing to stay here all year, all year next year, if necessary, but I don't want us to succumb to his demands. I have no intention of succumbing to his demands. I am, frankly, bothered by the fact that at this stage in time, the President is really ratcheting up the partisan rhetoric. Frankly, that is not the right thing to do if he wants to work together. 
It is interesting, the President made a very nice bipartisan speech saying, `Yes, I compliment the Congress, they worked together and we passed the International Religious Freedom Act.' I was involved with that. We worked with the administration. We did do bipartisan work. It took bipartisan work. But you don't get that kind of cooperation on the budget when you have the President making all kinds of partisan statements. I will give you an example. 
In his radio address given to the Nation today, the President said:  
This week, unfortunately, we saw partisanship defeat progress, as 51 Republican Senators joined together to kill the HMO Patients' Bill of Rights. 
One, I just disagree with that. The majority of Republican Senators--as a matter of fact, unanimous Republican Senators--said, `We are willing to pass a Patients' Bill of Rights,' not defeat one. `We are willing to pass one.' 
We made that offer to our colleagues on the Democratic side. We made it several times in June and several times in July. We said we were willing to pass this bill. As a matter of fact, we wanted to pass it before the August break. We made unanimous consent requests and said, `We will pass either your bill or our bill. You have the best bill that you can put together. You worked on yours for months; we worked on our bill for months. Let's vote, let's pass it, let's go to conference with the House.' 
But, no, the Democrats wouldn't agree with it. The Democrats kept us from passing a Patients' Bill of Rights. You don't pass a bill this complicated the last day of the session. Senator Daschle offered some amendment and said, `Oh, let's run this through.' That was nothing but for show. 
Yet we even find an e-mail from the House Democrat events coordinator that said, `Hey, let's put on a real show; let's have everybody get together; Senator Daschle can orchestrate this; we will have a bunch of colleagues.' 
Sure enough, they had a bunch of colleagues go over in some show of support on the last day of the session. Bingo. 
If they wanted to pass a Patients' Bill of Rights, they should have said `Yea, we agree, we will pass them, find out where the votes are.' The Democrats would never agree to a unanimous consent request to pass Patients' Bill of Rights. 
They are the ones who killed the bill. When the President said, `. . . we saw partisanship defeat progress . . .' he forgot to say the Democrats wouldn't agree to a process to pass the bill, which we offered in June and several times in July. He forgot to mention that. It kind of bothers me because, again, he says, `We want bipartisanship,' and he makes a partisan statement on a national radio address. 
I have also heard the President state, `We can't have a tax cut because we're going to reserve every dime of the surplus to protect Social Security.' All the while--he knows it and we know it--he has his staff members running around the Congress saying, `We want more money and we want to declare everything an emergency so it won't count on the budget, so it won't be part of the budget agreement' that he adopted and agreed to in 1997. `We want more money.' 
The totals are right in the $18 billion, $20 billion-plus range. `We want more money for a lot of things and, oh, yes, it is all off budget; it doesn't count; it's an emergency.' What a great game. 
Again, I remind my colleagues that the Congress is responsible for passing appropriations bills, and we need to pass them. If he vetoes them, fine, he can shut down the Government. We can pass continuing resolutions, and we can do that as much as necessary. 
The President in his weekly radio address said: 
Our Nation needs 100,000 new, highly qualified teachers to reduce class size in early grades. 
He said, `We need more teachers, more buildings.' 
The President said: 
So again today, I call on Congress to help communities build or modernize 5,000 schools with targeted tax credits. 
Mr. President, I want more money for education. I want a lot better education, but I really don't want the President of the United States or some bureaucrat in the Department of Education deciding which school in Oklahoma gets a new teacher or which building in Oklahoma is going to be rebuilt or which classroom is going to be modernized or updated. 
Why should we have that decision made in Washington, DC? Why should Federal bureaucrats be involved? Maybe our schools in Oklahoma need more teachers or maybe they need new buildings or maybe they need new computers. Why don't we trust Oklahomans to make that decision? Why don't we trust the parents and the teachers and the school boards? No, this administration does not trust local school boards, local teachers, parents, Governors to be making that decision. 
He wants to mandate it from Washington, DC. This is a new demand. Guess what? We have had votes on these issues. He did not win. The President's program did not win. We had two or three votes earlier this year. He did not win on the school building program; did not win on the 100,000 new teachers. But yet this is a new demand, that he is going to try to get it, he is not going to sign the bill unless we fund it. 
I am going to tell you right now, at least as far as this Senator is concerned--and maybe I do not control the conferences--but I do not have any intention to ever fund those programs. I think decisions on hiring teachers and building school buildings should be made in the local school districts, by the local school boards, by the parent/teacher associations, by the Governors--not by those of us in Congress or, frankly, by some bureaucrat in the Department of Education. 
So maybe we will be here for a long time. Again, the President has the right to veto the bill. Fine. Let him veto the bill. Maybe we will be operating on continuing resolutions for the rest of the year. If that is what happens, that is what happens. I will, again, repeat that we will pass enough continuing resolutions as necessary to keep Government open. 
Maybe we will have to pass one every day. Maybe we will have to pass one every week. Maybe we will have to pass one every month. But we are not going to shut Government down. We are not going to demand anything. We will pass the continuing resolutions to keep Government operating at fiscal year 1998 levels as long as necessary. We will stay here. We are happy to stay next week. We are happy to stay the following week. We are happy to stay all year, if that is necessary. But I hope, and I believe, we are not going to succumb to this last-minute politicization of, `We want more money. Let's spend the surplus.' 
I have even heard, in the President's radio or in his speech yesterday--`We've got the first balanced budget in 29 years. Our economy is prosperous. This budget is purely a simple test of whether or not, after 9 months of doing nothing, we're going to do the right thing about our children's future.' 
`We want more money' is basically what he is saying. I also heard him say we should save the surplus for Social Security. Now he is talking about new investments. In his speech yesterday, he said we need new investments for everything I have mentioned, but he also runs through a whole list of other new spending, social spending, that he is trying to crowd through in the last minute. 
I do not have any intentions of succumbing to these demands. I hope my colleagues will not. I just say this, with all respect, how the President could demagog that we cannot have a tax cut because of the Social Security surplus and then in the next minute, propose to spend the so-called surplus on all these investments is beyond me. I just have no intention whatsoever of going along with that. 
I think we should abide by the budget. I do not think we should squander the surplus with new Federal spending. Some of us were interested in tax cuts because we knew that if we did not allow taxpayers to keep their money, that Congress and/or the administration would say, `Well, let's have more spending.' There is a real propensity around the place to spend money. 
I just hope that our colleagues will resist that temptation. I hope that they will resist these new overtures by the administration that seems to think they should be an equal body with Congress in writing appropriations bills. I think we should have legitimate negotiations but, frankly, that does not make people equal partners. 
We have equal branches of Government with divisions of powers. Again, the Constitution says that Congress shall write the laws and Congress shall appropriate the money. We need to get on with our business and do that, send the appropriations bills to the President. If he vetoes them, fine, then let's pass a continuing resolution to keep Government open.

Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I have given accolades to a couple of my colleagues for their service in the Senate, including Senator Bumpers. I see Senator Ford is on the floor. I have had the pleasure of serving with Senator Ford for 18 years on the Energy Committee. We worked together on a lot of things. And, in my opinion, some of the most significant legislation that passed Congress, in my tenure, we have worked together on. 
One was the Natural Gas Deregulation Act that President Bush signed after about 6 years of negotiations and hard work, but probably one of the most difficult pieces of legislation that we have passed. 
And if you go back on the history of natural gas regulation and deregulation, it was a very, very difficult task. It was a pleasure for me to work with Senator Ford in that respect. We worked together on other issues as well. 
I compliment him for his 24 years of service in the Senate. Anyone that spends almost a quarter of a century of service in the Senate, I think, is to be complimented. I compliment him for his leadership and for his representation of the people of Kentucky. Again, it was a pleasure and honor for me to serve with him. I compliment him and wish him every best wish as he returns to his State of Kentucky. 
I yield the floor.

I have already complimented Senator Lieberman for his leadership and his partnership in making this happen. But also I mentioned last night Senator Specter worked tirelessly on this; Senator Coats did as well. Senator Feinstein came in and negotiated with us and I think made some important changes. 
I also just quickly would like to thank a couple of staff people. Cecile Shea of Senator Lieberman's staff worked tirelessly on this legislation; John Hanford of Senator Lugar's staff and Steve Moffitt of my staff have put in maybe more hours on this piece of legislation than most any I have seen. Others who helped were Laura Bryant and Willie Imboden. 
Also, I thank Senator Helms for his support and leadership, as well as Congressman Wolf for leading the effort in the House of Representatives. They have assured us that they will pass this legislation as soon as they receive it. 
So I thank my colleagues and I yield the floor. And I yield the remainder of my time.

Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I am disappointed that our colleagues on the Democrat side of the aisle really have tried to play politics with this issue. Many of us were very, very serious about trying to pass a positive bill that dealt with HMO organizations, with health care. We studied the issue for a long time. Senator Daschle said after they realized the polls, they introduced the bill in July. We worked 7 or 8 months trying to put a bill together that would be a responsible, positive bill to meet certain objectives. One, not increase the number of people in the uninsured category. Unfortunately, I think that would have happened under the Kennedy bill. It would have dramatically increased the cost of insurance and, therefore, dramatically increase the number of people who are uninsured. We said, What can we do that would be a positive impact on helping people have affordable health care and maybe provide some coverage and protections for those people who don't have it from their States, and so we put together a package to do that. 
We didn't come up and say, hey, trial lawyers, what would you like? Under the Democrats' bill, really, it was a bill that would greatly enhance attorney fees. It gave people the right not only to sue the HMO and the health care provider, but also the employer as well. The net result is that lots of employers would have dropped plans, increased the number of uninsured. That would not have helped anybody. It would have been a serious mistake. We didn't want to pass legislation that would increase the number of uninsured by 1 million people. That would have been a mistake. 
So we were willing to take it up. Our colleagues have said, wait a minute, we want to vote today. Today may be the last or second to last day we are going to be in session. In June or July, we offered to do this. Or we tried to get it done this September where we would have a reasonable time limit, where we would vote and pass legislation. Unfortunately, I think Senator Kennedy and others didn't want to do that because they didn't have the votes. 
Their proposal didn't have the votes. It had a lot of rhetoric, but it didn't have the votes. They never would take yes for an answer. We were willing to take up their proposal. We were willing to take up our proposal. We were willing to have a couple of amendments on each side. They could have drafted those amendments any way they wanted to. They could have addressed every issue they wanted to, and we could have passed legislation. We could have done it in time to go to conference with the House and maybe work out a responsible and reasonable bill that could be enacted into law. Unfortunately, they wouldn't take yes for an answer. 
So they played games trying to turn it into an election year issue. I can see it right now. People will try to run ads--maybe in my State--and say, `Nickles opposed Patients' Bill of Rights.' But the truth is, we had 50 cosponsors on this side of the aisle who cosponsored a Patients' Bill of Rights that, in my opinion, and the belief of the majority of the body, was far superior to the bill that was proffered by our colleagues on the Democratic side of the aisle. It is unfortunate to me that they wouldn't take yes for an answer. They wouldn't agree to a unanimous consent request that would have allowed us to pass legislation and, instead, resorted to some type of shenanigan where they tried to get a vote and then have the galleries filled with people in the House. 
And so, `Oh, yes, we are really working to do this,' when all they were looking for was an election year ad not to pass real legislation.

Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I want to again thank my colleague from Pennsylvania for his support of this bill and for his leadership on the bill that passed the House of Representatives. 
I will mention and compare a little bit between the House bill and the Senate bill. 
The House bill passed with an overwhelming vote. It came down very hard with punitive actions against countries that had gross violations of religious freedom, or had a lot of punitive action towards those countries that participated in really the most atrocious type of religious persecution--death, torture, imprisonment. 
Again, I compliment Representative Wolf and Senator Specter for bringing that issue to the attention of the American people, maybe to the world's attention, because a lot of people didn't know that people were going to jail, that they were imprisoned for long periods of time, they might be tortured, they might be actually killed for their religious beliefs. This bill goes a little bit further than that. It might be a little milder on the sanctions side because it gives the President a lot of options, and I would agree and I happen to think that is the right action, but we also provide that we should recognize violations of religious freedom including violations such as assembling for peaceful religious activities, for speaking out on one's religion, for changing one's religious beliefs, for possessing or distributing religious materials or raising one's children in the religion of your choice. 
In other words, we believe religious freedom should be a basic right for all Americans, for all people worldwide, and the United Nation's declaration includes such freedom. Countries that join the United Nations say, yes, we believe in religious freedom, but yet we find these things happening all the time. 
As Members of the Senate and Members of the House, many of us have been engaged in trying to protect religious freedom when we find that maybe our constituents are denied access, denied the opportunity to worship, maybe put in prison because they share their faith or they wish to worship in a particular country and they find that it is not even available. So our bill goes a little bit further than the House bill in the fact that we include a lot of other violations of religious freedom. 
I might mention a few other things, Mr. President, maybe outline some of the things that our bill does in comparison--not necessarily a comparison with what the House did but an explanation of what our bill does.

I will tell all my colleagues there has been a significant amount of work that has gone into this bill. Questions have been raised. We tried to alleviate some of those concerns. 
I also wish to thank Senator Biden, Senator Feinstein, Senator Hagel, Senator Gramm, and others who have raised questions and who have worked with us to try to solve some of those. 
This bill creates a position with Ambassador rank called Ambassador at Large for International Religious Freedom. This Ambassador will serve as a full-time, high-level, single-issue diplomat working with the State Department, trying to find out what religious persecution is happening in various places around the world and to represent the administration. 
We also set up a Commission on International Religious Liberty. This is a 10-member, bipartisan commission with appointments from Congress and the President. It will provide an outside independent voice investigating religious persecution incidents, raising the profile of religious persecution while making substantive policy recommendations to the Congress and the White House. 
On this commission of 10-members, the Ambassador at Large will be a nonvoting member. The President or the executive branch will be entitled to three commissioners and in Congress the President's party in each House will be entitled to an additional position on both sides for a total of five, and the opposing party, in this case it would be the Republicans--Democrats control the White House--the Republicans would be entitled to two appointments from both the House and the Senate, for four. 
This commission, being an independent commission, will have the authority to investigate, to conduct hearings to find out what is happening with religious freedom around the world, and be able to make a report to the administration on their recommendations on how to alleviate religious persecution. 
I might mention our goal is not to punish any country that is violating or persecuting anybody because of their religious beliefs. The goal is not to punish anybody. Our goal is to change behavior. Our goal is to eliminate religious persecution. Our goal is to expand religious freedom worldwide, and we have gone to great lengths to do that. 
Our bill says the commission will make its recommendations to the President and to Congress by May 1. There is also an additional report that is made by the State Department on the advice of the Ambassador at Large, and the State Department gives a country-by-country review of religious freedom. They report that yes, there has been progress in some countries or no, there has not been progress, but rather significant persecution in basically all countries with whom we have relations. 
I might mention we have human rights reports right now, human rights reports that cover these countries. But for the most part, in many cases, we have been silent on religious freedom in those countries. So now we will be talking about an annual report on religious freedom and persecution. 
And then we talk about responses, what can we do if we find that some countries are violating individuals' or people's religious freedom. Under the proposal, we have some positive things to promote religious freedom. 
The International Religious Freedom Act has several measures to promote religious liberty abroad. We have USAID funding for legal protection of religious freedoms in restrictive countries. International broadcasting can be used to promote religious freedom. Fulbright exchanges, for example, of religious leaders and scholars and legal experts can be used. Religious freedom awards and performance pay for meritorious Foreign Service officers; equal access to embassies for U.S. citizens at the embassy's discretion for nationals for religious activities on terms not less favorable for other nongovernmental activities; training for Foreign Service officers and refugee and asylum personnel to ensure the promotion of religious liberty, and accurate reporting of religious persecution and relief for victims of persecution. 
We also have steps to directly target those agents and those countries that are responsible for religious persecution, and we have several of those. Some people have said, well, those are various sanctions. And these people, talking about sanctions, they usually think, well, we are going to have a wheat embargo. That is what happened during the Carter administration when the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan. I don't see that happening. 
There are several items, so-called sanctions. We have 1 through 15, and I might mention the first one is a private demarche. The second one is an official demarche. Those can be letters to the embassy: We have reports of people being persecuted; we hope you don't do that anymore. It might be a call to the Ambassador. It might be a call to the Secretary of State or to the diplomatic personnel that there are reports of religious persecution; we want that to be changed. Or it could be more serious. We could cancel a scientific visit. We could have cancellation of a cultural exchange. We could deny one or more State visits. We can cancel State visits. We can do several things. 
And then we go into the possible range of economic sanctions. Some people say, well, wait a minute, should you do this? Let's talk about it. These economic sanctions are only for the most egregious or the more, what we define under our bill as particularly severe violations of religious freedom. And particularly severe violations of religious freedom deals again with torture, imprisonment, deals with death, again the most egregious forms of religious persecution. And in those areas we have some economics--the withdrawal, limitation or suspension of development assistance. We have direction of the director of OPEC or TDA or EXIM not to approve guarantees, or we have the withdrawal, limitation or suspension of security assistance. I might mention it says `limitation.' It wouldn't have to be 100 percent. It could be 5 percent or it could be a little bit more. 
Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I thank the Chairman for his work and support of this very important legislation. 
I also thank Senator Kyl for his dedicated work on this issue. I was pleased to join him as an original cosponsor of this bill, because I believe that this is a fundamental issue of freedom for all senior citizens. Every senior citizen should have the fundamental right to pay out of their own pocket for the health care they want from the physician they choose. 
President Clinton has repeatedly stated, most recently in his State of the Union address, that `all Americans should have the right to choose the doctor they want for the care they need.' But apparently, the administration does not believe this should apply to Medicare beneficiaries. In fact, during the debate on the Balanced Budget Act (BBA) of 1997, the administration repeatedly stated their opposition to giving his unfettered freedom to senior citizens. 
Finally, the administration agreed to drop their objections to this provision if the BBA would grant seniors only limited freedom with certain restrictions. In the spirit of compromise, the BBA included a limited provision to allow physicians to enter into private contracts for Medicare-covered services. Unfortunately, the provision in the BBA did not go far enough. 
Under BBA 97, in order to enter into these contracts, a physician or other provider would have to opt out of Medicare for two years and sign an affidavit, approved by HCFA, to ensure that no Medicare patients were treated. But the two-year exclusion presents the doctor with a difficult choice: either treat the patient on a private contract and drop all other Medicare patients for two years; or refuse to treat the patient in favor of current Medicare patients. This is a difficult decision that neither a physician or beneficiary should be required to make. 
Now, one can argue that the reforms in the BBA were a step forward for Medicare private contracting. If is true that HCFA had interpreted Medicare law, prior to the passage of BBA 97, as effectively prohibiting private contracts. In fact, HCFA had gone as far as threatening physicians and other providers with fines and exclusion from Medicare and even criminal prosecution. So if HCFA's interpretation was correct, perhaps the provisions included in BBA 97 were a step forward. 
On the other hand, many respected Medicare experts have suggested that HCFA did, in fact, misinterpret the Medicare statute. In other words, Medicare law did not prohibit private contracts, but rather it was silent on the issue. As I read the Medicare law, prior to BBA, I see nothing that prohibits Medicare beneficiaries and providers from entering into these private arrangements. So if this interpretation is correct, the provisions included in BBA could be viewed as a step backward. 
In either case, the right thing to do is to allow seniors unfettered, unrestricted access to the doctor of their choice. The Kyl legislation does just that. It would extend this right to Medicare beneficiaries with no limitation, allowing Medicare beneficiaries to be treated for Medicare-covered services by the physicians of their choice on a `case-by-case' and a `patient-by-patient' basis. No doctor who chooses to enter into a private contracting arrangement with a senior would be faced with fines or expulsion from the Medicare program. 
Opponents of private contracting make two primary arguments against this legislation: unethical doctors will take advantage of seniors to increase their income; and it will result in excessive fraud and abuse in the Medicare program. 
The argument that perplexes me the most is the concern that unethical doctors would take advantage of vulnerable seniors and use private contracts to increase their annual income. If I were a Medicare beneficiary I would be offended by the notion that I am unable to make my own financial and medical decision. Senior 
citizens are some of the most frugal and well informed health care shoppers in the country. Additionally, if I were a physician, I would be offended by the assumption that most doctors are unethical in their professional activities. Any physician that were to engage in unethical or coercive practices faces tremendous risks, including the loss of their medical license for ethical violations. 
I assume that those who believe physicians will use the Kyl legislation to line their pockets would also be concerned with new federal coverage mandates on private health insurance. Every federal coverage mandate we place on health insurance providers increases the cost of health insurance and increases the revenues of physicians. But I haven't heard many members who are concerned that federal mandates which require insurance companies to pay for a variety of treatments may increase the profits of physicians. Do we assume that physicians and other practitioners will be ethical when an insurance company is paying the bill and unethical when a vulnerable senior is paying the bill? The fact is that the opponents of this legislation simply want more control over the health care of senior citizens. 
The bill also contains strong consumer protection standards to ensure that Medicare beneficiaries are not exploited. Private contracts must be in writing, signed by the beneficiary, and identify the services covered by the contract. It prohibits private contracts in emergency situations, unless the contract was entered into before the onset of the emergency medical condition. 
Private contracts may only be entered into on a prospective basis and may not apply to services rendered prior to the signing of the contract. Such contracts must also notify the beneficiary that Medicare is not responsible for the payment of any services covered under the contract and that the beneficiary has the right to have such services provided by other physicians or practitioners to whom Medicare payment would be made. 
Other opponents of this legislation argue that private contracting will result in double billing and outright fraud. Perhaps the opponents haven't looked closely at the extensive anti-fraud measures included in this legislation. The legislation prohibits double payments by requiring physicians and practitioners entering into private contracts to submit to the Secretary such information as may be necessary to avoid any payment under Part A or Part B for services covered under the contract. Fraudulent billing would be detected and punished through existing fraud and abuse laws and standard auditing procedures used by Medicare and private plans. If Medicare did pay for a service, the patient would receive a statement and could easily notify Medicare of the payment error. 
Mr. President, this legislation adequately addresses the concerns that have been raised by the opponents. The integrity of Medicare system is not at issue here. The defining issue is really quite simple. This is a fundamental issue of individual freedom. Do you support giving senior citizens the freedom to pay out of their own pocket for the health care they want from the physician they choose? Or do you support limiting that freedom and restricting the health care choices available to senior citizens? I hope my colleagues will join Senator Kyl in supporting this legislation and supporting individual freedom for every senior citizen.

Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I was running through the potential sanctions, sanctions that would only apply for countries that were guilty of particularly severe violations of religious freedom. And particularly severe violations of religious freedom under our bill means: `Systematic, ongoing, egregious violations of religious freedom, including violations such as torture, cruel, inhuman, degrading treatment or punishment, prolonged detention without charges, causing the disappearance of persons by the abduction or clandestine detention of those persons, and other flagrant denials of the right to life, liberty or the security of persons.' 
And so, Mr. President, we define that. That is really bad the actors. In those cases, our bill says that we would have economic sanctions. I was just discussing those. That would include the withdrawal, limitation or suspension of development assistance. It says `limitation.' It didn't say `automatically all of it be limited, but at least some withdrawal or some limitation. 
It gives the President the flexibility--a whole range of options. Also it would direct the director of OPEC or TDA or EXIM not to approve guarantees, extensions or credits to the governments involving gross violations to religious freedom. 
It also would have a sanction that would allow the withdrawal, limitation or suspension of security assistance. Again, it could be suspension. It could be limitation. 
Also, another option would be instructing U.S. directors of international financial institutions to vote against loans to governments involving gross violations of religious freedom. 
Another sanction option would be to prohibit the licenses or authority to export goods or technology to governments determined to be responsible for such persecution involving gross violations of religious freedom; another prohibiting any U.S. financial institution from providing credits totaling more than $10 million in any year to governments involving gross violation as to religious freedom; and one final one prohibiting the U.S. Government from procuring goods or services from foreign governments involved in gross violations. 
We have given the President a multitude of options, a range, which could reduce economic assistance or economic loans to those countries. Also, I might mention, we give the President the option to waive these sanctions. We have modified that to accommodate some of the concerns that some of our people have. The sanctions can be waived to further the purposes of the act. 
If persons involved--maybe the commission that studied this, maybe it is the Ambassador, maybe the State Department--said, `Wait a minute, some of these sanctions might do more harm than good,' the sanctions could be waived. It might result in greater persecution of individual beliefs by some governments. Our Government would have the option to waive these sanctions. Or we modify it to include that the sanctions could be waived for national security interests. We modified that to say `for important national interests' the sanctions could be waived. 
We have in this bill an ambassador-at-large for international religious freedom; we have a commission of high-level people appointed by Congress and by the President to study and to make recommendations to the Congress and to the President, the Commission on International Religious Liberty, to make recommendations on what can be done to promote religious liberty worldwide; and we have given some tools and options to encourage positive behavior, positive efforts as well as some punitive efforts to try to modify behavior. 
Our purpose in this bill is not to punish any country. Our purpose is to modify behavior to improve religious liberty worldwide. We don't want to be picking up the paper as we did earlier this year when the New York Times, for example, on May 11, had an article that said a Pakistani Catholic cleric was buried. It said a Roman Catholic bishop committed suicide last week apparently to protest religious discrimination. Religious discrimination and persecution must be pretty severe if a bishop would commit suicide to protest the degree of persecution. 
Other people have talked about Christians being sold into slavery in Sudan, or other countries where Christians, Jews, or other individuals were placed in prison merely for practicing their faith. 
I want to thank again my colleagues who worked with me on this legislation. I mentioned Senator Specter earlier. I mentioned Senator Lieberman who has worked with me in countless meetings for hours trying to work out this legislation. Senator Coats from Indiana is on the floor and will be called upon momentarily. No one has worked harder. I told him some time ago I feel that he is one of the best Senators I have had the opportunity to work with, and I mean that in all sincerity. He is a person with very strong religious beliefs and convictions, and his efforts to see this bill pass to make sure that we improve religious liberty worldwide are very much recognized, very much appreciated by this Senator, and I think by all Senators. I also would like to thank my colleagues, Senator Biden and Senator Feinstein, who have also worked with us in putting this legislation together. 
I want to thank a couple of other people who have also worked in this effort. Steve Moffitt of my staff put in a lot of energy and a lot of the effort. John Hanford has put in years trying to enact measures to protect people who have been persecuted worldwide for religious beliefs. Also, on Senator Lieberman's staff, Cecile Shea has worked countless hours on this. I thank them for their efforts. 
I see my colleague from Indiana is on the floor. I am happy to yield him such time as he desires on this legislation. 
How much time remains?

I want to reiterate my statement that Senator Coats was there from the beginning, and he was there at almost every meeting saying, `Let's get this done,' and, `Let's forge the consensus,' `Let's make the compromise,' and he helped make it happen. 
He is also very correct in complimenting Senator Lieberman for making it happen. I mentioned that earlier. Senator Lieberman has been with us on this bill for a long time. He has worked with us. He has helped us craft the bill and helped make compromises to make sure it is enacted. 
I also thank our colleague from California, Senator Feinstein, whom we met with last night at length to be sure, again, that this bill would be acceptable and we could get it through. We did. We made a change. We changed the waiver provision from `national security' to `important national interests,' which, again, is something the administration wanted. 
I think it is still compatible with our goals and objectives of passing a good bill that will help move countries, that have been persecuting people because of their religious beliefs, away from that behavior. 
I thank my colleague from California for her work, and also the Senator from Delaware, Senator Biden, who worked with us, as well, in negotiating with us, and helped us craft a package that I am confident we will pass tomorrow with an overwhelming vote. 
I am confident the House, likewise, will pass the bill, as we will pass it in the Senate, and this bill will be on the President's desk and will become law. As a result, I think it will save lives and it will help alleviate persecution of individuals because they are practicing their faith. 
Again, I thank all of our colleagues on both sides of the aisle for making this happen. 
I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, it is almost kind of sad in a way to think that Dirk Kempthorne will be leaving the Senate after only one term in the U.S. Senate. It has been a pleasure to work with Dirk, to be with him, to get to know him, to get to know his family, his wife Pat. But I will just say Dirk Kempthorne is a Senator's Senator. He is a person who comes from the great State of Idaho. 
He brought a great deal of, I must say, refreshing energy to the Senate. He served as mayor of Boise City for 7 years. He was elected to the U.S. Senate in 1992 and proved something unconventional: He could get a lot done in his first term in the Senate. Most people have the idea you have to be in the Senate a long time before you can get anything accomplished, but he proved quite the opposite. 
He proved to be a very effective legislator. He proved to be a person who could work on both sides of the aisle, that he could work with Democrats and Republicans and make things happen. 
He was the principal sponsor of a bill that most of us have claimed some part to, the unfunded mandates bill that President Clinton signed and it became law. It was strongly supported by States, Governors, mayors and commissioners and others who said, `Let's quit passing unfunded mandates on to the States, cities and counties.' 
He has been instrumental in leading the fight in needed reform in the Endangered Species Act. He has been a tireless worker on the Armed Services Committee. 
He has always kept his priorities straight. His family has always been first and foremost. His love for his State is very evident. 
Now he will return to the State of Idaho. He is running for Governor. I am very confident he will be elected Governor, and I am quite confident he will be one of the outstanding Governors in the country. I appreciate his service and his friendship. He has been an outstanding Senator. I hate to see him leave the U.S. Senate, but I do wish him, his wife and his family best wishes as he leaves the Senate and returns to his State and continues his public service in a different capacity, and that will be as Governor of the great State of Idaho.

Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I also wish to pay my compliments and accolades to Senator Dan Coats of Indiana. I have had the pleasure of knowing Dan Coats. He actually was elected to the House of Representatives in 1980, the same year I was elected to serve in the U.S. Senate. He had something unusual happen. 
When Dan Quayle was selected as Vice President and elected in 1988, Dan Coats was appointed to take his place in 1988. 
That almost sounds like it was easy, but it turned out he had to run for reelection in 1990; and he won. But that was only for a partial term, and so he also had to run for reelection in 1992. So he had the unenviable task of having really challenging races both in 1990 and in 1992 for the U.S. Senate. He won both, and deservedly so, because he has been an outstanding U.S. Senator. 
I remember Dan Quayle telling me, `You're really going to like Dan Coats.' Dan Quayle and I were good friends. And Dan Coats and I have become very good friends. And he was exactly right. Dan Coats and his wife, Marcia, his family, are not only good friends of our family, but I would say anybody serving in this body--anybody--whether they be on the House side or the Senate side, cannot help but like Dan and Marcia Coats. They are a couple--they are a couple--in the greatest tradition of the Senate. 
His wife Marcia has been active in the Senate wives' groups and active with the prayer groups that many of our wives are involved with. They go to functions together. They are athletically involved. They both play tennis. They both play golf. They both have a good time. They keep their priorities straight. They both have a very strong belief in God and in their families, and work comes down somewhere below that. 
He has done an outstanding job as a Senator for the great State of Indiana. I would say he has done an outstanding job as a Senator for all of us in America, whether it be his work on the Armed Services Committee, whether it be his tireless efforts on welfare reform in the Labor Committee, his efforts to try to reduce poverty, his efforts to alleviate suffering amongst kids. 
Many of our colleagues are not aware of it, but he is national president of the Big Brothers program, which could probably be a full-time job for anybody, but he is able to do that. He has been a Big Brother. He actually was a Big Brother in a town for a youngster who did not have a dad, did not have a mentor. Dan Coats became his mentor--as a matter of fact, became his best man at his wedding. 
What a great compliment for an individual who, of course, had unlimited demands on his time, was willing to take time out and serve as a Big Brother to a youngster who did not have a dad, and he did it for years. Ultimately this young man became quite a success, a success in his own right, and I think in large part because of the time and attention and love that Dan Coats gave to him. He selected Dan Coats as his best man at his wedding, which is quite a compliment. 
Dan Coats was recently selected as Christian Statesman of the Year by a national organization. They had a big banquet honoring him, and it was well deserved. I have the pleasure of knowing Dan Coats in many respects. His belief in God, it is sincere, it is real. He is the embodiment of a Christian statesman. And so that award was well deserved. 
He has been leader, as many of us know, of the Senate Prayer Breakfast that we have ongoing in the Senate that goes back for years and years. He has been chairman or president of that group for us for the last year or so and has done a good job--done an outstanding job in every respect. 
So he is absolutely a dear friend, and I hate to see him leave the Senate. He has served now in the Senate since 1988, so only for 10 years. But he also served 8 years in the House, and before that he served a couple years in the Army. So he has given a lot of years in public service, and he deserves, I guess, a chance to do something else. 
But I am confident--absolutely confident--that whatever he does will be a great service to this country. He has been a real blessing to this body. He and his wife have been a real blessing to this country. And it is with great regret that I see Dan Coats join the group of retiring Senators. But I do wish every best wish to him and his family, and I compliment them for their outstanding service to their State, to their country, to God, and to their family. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I would like to pay a brief tribute to my friend and colleague and neighbor from the State of Arkansas for his 24 years of service in the Senate. 
I have had the pleasure of working with Senator Dale Bumpers since I was elected to the Senate 18 years ago. So I am completing three terms. He is just completing four terms. Twenty-four years in the Senate is a long time. But I think the Senate has been blessed by his humor, his levity. The camaraderie that Senator Bumpers has brought to the Senate floor and to the Senate group has been enjoyable, educational, and humorous, to say the least. 
I have had the pleasure of serving with Senator Bumpers on the Energy Committee where he has been ranking member for the last several years. We have worked together on a lot of legislation. We passed some good legislation, I might add, as well. So I compliment him for his years of service. 
He served 4 years as Governor of Arkansas; I think he was elected in 1970; and elected to the U.S. Senate in 1974. It seems like he has been in the same chair for years. He has been the same Senator who will still get excited on a speech and pull his microphone cord to the limit. Maybe he might test the limit of the cord as much as anybody I know in the Senate--a very good speaker, a very good friend who has served his State very well. 
We worked together on several pieces of legislation, including legislation that dealt with the exchange of lands, both for the Forest Service and for protecting lands in both Arkansas and Oklahoma, that would not have happened if it had not been for his good work and leadership. And frankly, he was a pleasure to work with on that bill, and many other pieces of legislation throughout our careers. 
So I certainly wish Dale Bumpers and his wife Betty every best wish in their days ahead. He has made a valuable contribution as a Member of the U.S. Senate and as a Member of our Senate family. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor. 
Mr. JEFFORDS addressed the Chair.

Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, Senator Bryan and I have been working for nearly a year to address concerns within the motor carrier industry with respect to the Fair Credit Reporting Act. I would like to thank Senator Byran for his leadership on this important legislation. We have been working to ensure all involved parties are in agreement with the changes to the Fair Credit Reporting Act in this bill. 
The Consumer Credit Reporting Reform Act of 1996, which passed as part of the Omnibus Conciliation Appropriations Act of 1997, contained reforms to the Fair Credit Reporting Act which are in conflict with the reality of how the motor carrier industry hires safe, responsible drivers. 
We have reached an agreement with consumer groups, including U.S. PIRG, the chairman and ranking member of the Banking Committee, the Federal Trade Commission, and the credit industry which will not reduce consumer protections but will ensure a fair process for the regulated community. I would like to thank everyone for their help throughout this process on this important legislation. 
This legislation will more appropriately address the manner in which the trucking industry hires safe, responsible drivers. If an individual applies for employment by mail, telephone, or electronic means, the employer can notify the potential employee orally, in writing, or electronically, that a consumer report may be obtained for employment purposes. The applicant must then consent to the procurement of that report. 
This legislation will also allow an employer within the trucking industry, if the potential employee has applied for employment by mail, telephone, or electronically, to take adverse action based on the report and then notify the consumer within three business days that adverse action has been taken. 
In addition, this bill also includes a provision that will allow criminal convictions to be reported past 7 years. This information is critical to employers in the areas of child care, education, and household services. 
And finally we have included technical amendments to the Fair Credit Reporting Act that, again, the Federal Trade Commission and the regulated community are in agreement with. 
It is essential that this commonsense legislation pass the Senate this year and I encourage my colleagues to support this bill. I want to again thank everyone for their support on this issue and I thank my colleagues Senator Sarbanes, Senator Bryan, Senator Mack, and others on the Banking Committee for their leadership on the Fair Credit Reporting Act.

Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, first I wish to congratulate and compliment my colleague from Virginia for a very thoughtful speech, and also for his homework in this area, and the fact that he spent some time traveling to this troubled region of the world. 
I had the pleasure of traveling with Senator Warner and Senator Dole, I believe in 1991. We met with Mr. Milosevic and we traveled into Kosovo. I became convinced that Mr. Milosevic was a tyrant. I still believe he is. He needs to be stopped. We need to have affirmative action to stop him. We have had strong words from this administration. We have had very little action. I am not convinced they have a plan that will fully complement their desires, so I am concerned about that. 
But I am also working with other colleagues in this body to try to see that the United States and NATO stand up to Milosevic and try to develop a plan that is workable. I appreciate the fact that my colleague from Virginia is willing to speak out and lend his experience and education in this area. Maybe together we can come up with something that will work and stop the atrocities, but also avoid some of the pitfalls that could easily have happened in Bosnia, where some of us were concerned about the cost and the expense. 
Some of us felt misled by this administration when they said we would only be in Bosnia for a short period of time. We stated that wasn't the case. We knew that wasn't the case. We knew we wouldn't be limited to 1 year. Frankly, they misled Congress and they misled the American people as far as the commitment in Bosnia. I want to avoid that repetition of that as it pertains to Kosovo. 
I appreciate my colleagues' comments.

Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, to conclude the dialog on Kosovo, the administration gave most Members of the Senate a briefing yesterday, but they have a lot of work to do. They have a lot of work to do if they are going to convince the Congress, if they are going to convince the American people. They have a lot of leveling with the American people as far as the expense, as far as the obligation, as far as what the next step is after the first phase. They haven't answered those questions. 
That is not exactly what I call `consulting with Congress.' Maybe we had a little dialog with the administration, but we have a lot of work to do yet.

Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, earlier today, I, Senator Lieberman, Senator Specter, Senator Coats, Senator Akaka, as well as Congressman Wolf, and other leaders of various religious organizations, had a press conference discussing the International Religious Freedom Act. We came out and spoke in favor of Congress passing the International Religious Freedom Act this year. 
I tell my colleagues, I very much hope and expect we will do that. I think it is one of the highest priorities we have left before we adjourn this session. 
The issue of religious persecution and freedom is an issue that I have been working on, as many others have, for a long time. I very much value the opportunity and the right and the privilege that I have as an American citizen to worship as I please, where I please, how I please. In fact, I believe it is one of the most precious rights that any of us have as a citizen of this country. 
Unfortunately, too many people in too many countries do not have that right. It is unfortunate that in many places all around the world, religious persecution is a common practice. It happens in more countries than we can imagine. There are far too many state laws and policies that restrict religious freedom. 
For many years, I have worked with my colleagues, Senator Helms, Senator Lugar and Senator Nunn, to help win freedom for those around the world who suffer because of religious beliefs. While we have been successful on many occasions, sadly, in some cases, we haven't been. Most of this work has been done, I might mention, quietly and behind the scenes. 
In 1996, I was honored to sponsor a Senate resolution on religious persecution, which passed by unanimous consent. In that resolution, the Senate made a strong recommendation `that the President expand and invigorate the United States' international advocacy on behalf of persecuted Christians, and initiate a thorough examination of all the United States' policies that affect persecuted Christians.' 
Unlike the resolution that we helped get through the Senate 2 years ago, the legislation we are talking about today makes no distinction as to the faith of those who are being persecuted. This bill, I believe, will benefit all persons of all faiths who are persecuted for practicing their religion. 
Congressman Frank Wolf and Senator Arlen Specter have done a great job during the past year and a half in bringing this issue to the attention of the American public. I want to thank my friend, Congressman Wolf, for his leadership in the House, and of course all those persons in the House who passed a similar bill with a record vote, 375-41. Now, we in the Senate have a historic opportunity to finish the job that was started by the House, by passing the International Religious Freedom Act. 
I also want to thank my colleague, Senator Specter, for his leadership as original sponsor of the resolution. His work on our legislation, I think, has added considerably to the effectiveness of the bill. 
I also want to thank Senators Grams and Hagel who worked with us to modify the bill to ensure that what we are doing is responsible and it is done in a careful way. I think with their efforts we have crafted a bill that can be supported by all Senators, as evidenced by the fact that a broad spectrum of grassroots organizations have endorsed this bill. 
We have 29 Senate cosponsors, and I expect we will have more shortly. We have 21 groups that are supporting our bill who are advocating religious freedom. Those organizations include: the Religious Liberty Commission of the Southern Baptist Convention, the National Association of Evangelicals, the International Fellowship of Jews and Christians, the Christian Coalition, the Episcopal Church, the Anti-Defamation League, Advocates International, the National Jewish Coalition, Traditional Values Coalition, 
American Jewish Committee, Justice Fellowship, the Catholic Conference, B'Nai B'rith International, the Evangelical Lutheran Church of America, Catholic Conference of Major Superiors of Men's Institutes, Jewish Council for Public Affairs, Union of American Hebrew Congregations, Union of Orthodox Jewish Congregations of America, National Conference of Soviet Jewry, the United Methodist Church-Women's Division, and the American Coptic Association. 
The Episcopal Church stated the following about the International Religious Freedom Act in a letter to each office on Capitol Hill: 
The Nickles-Lieberman bill is a moderate, flexible response to human rights abuses that strikes the right balance between imposing inflexible sanctions in overlooking serious human rights abuses. 
The Catholic conference stated the following in a letter to my office: 
The bill is a reasonable and thoughtful effort to ensure that religious liberty has its rightful place in U.S. policy while preserving the authority of the Executive to pursue legitimate foreign policy goals. It deserves broad, bipartisan support and should be considered before Congress adjourns. 
B'nai B'rith International, The Union of American Hebrew Congregations, and The Union of Orthodox Jewish Congregations of America signed a letter to me stating: 
Passage of this bill would underscore our nation's commitment to human rights worldwide and lend hope to millions of religious believers who suffer because of their faith. Failure to act now on this legislation would send a dangerous signal to persecutors that they can act with impunity. 
Unfortunately, it is a tragic reality that literally millions of religious believers around the world live with the terrifying prospect of persecution--of being tortured, arrested, imprisoned, or even killed simply for their faith. Millions more around the world are denied, by government policy, the ability to practice their religion. 
I believe that this bill can be an effective tool in helping to resolve the problem of religious persecution throughout the world. 
The International Religious Freedom Act will establish a process to ensure that on an ongoing basis, the United States closely monitors religious persecution worldwide. 
International Religious Freedom Act uses a broad definition of religious persecution. This definition ranges in scope from the most egregious form of religious persecution--imprisonment, torture or death--to the most common--the inability of one to speak freely about one's religion, or to change religion. That's right. There are prohibitions in certain countries on changing your religion, on talking about your religion, or practicing your religion. 
This is an important aspect of the bill. If the definition of religious persecution were limited to only torture, imprisonment or death, the International Religious Freedom Act would only cover about a few countries, and would not include about 80 to 85 percent of the religious persecution that takes place in the world--the ability to practice one's religion. We adopted this standard to ensure that we address the problem before it escalates to torture and murder. 
Under the provisions of the International Religious Freedom Act, the President is required to take action against those countries that engage in religious persecution. However, the President is given a menu of options, fifteen items, from which he can choose the most appropriate response. In addition, the President is given the discretion to calibrate that action in response to each country's particular situation. 
In essence, this allows the President to weigh a variety of factors such as strategic importance, the historical relationship between the United States and that country and the severity of the religious persecution in that country when determining an action. 
I believe this flexibility also makes the International Religious Freedom Act more effective. We provide the President with a menu of options that makes it make likely that he will take action. 
We need to keep our eye on the goal. The goal of our bill is not to punish countries, but to change behavior, and if it is more likely that the President will take an action, then it is more likely that behavior will change. And that, Mr. President, in my opinion should be the goal of any legislation dealing with religious persecution--changing behavior in other countries that persecute people because of their faith. 
The International Religious Freedom Act, also seeks to promote religious freedom. The bill insists that U.S. foreign assistance should place a priority on developing legal protections and respect for religious freedom, by promoting exchanges and visits of religious leaders in the U.S. and abroad, and by making one of the priorities of our international broadcast programs the promotion of and respect for religious freedom. 
This bill is not a classic case of Uncle Sam imposing his views on the world. Although the right to religious freedom undergirds the very existence and origin of this country, the bill only asks other countries to live up to the commitments they have made in international documents and agreements. 
For example, article 1, paragraph 3 of the Charter of the United Nations states one of the purposes of the United Nations is to:  
Achieve international cooperation in . . . promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and for fundamental freedoms for all without distinctions as to race, sex, language or religion. 
There are 185 members of the United Nations. Some of the members of the United Nations are the biggest violators of the right to religious freedom. 
Article 18 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights states: 
Everyone has the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion; this right includes freedom to change his religion or belief and freedom either alone or in community with others and in public or private to manifest his religion or belief in teaching, practice, worship and observance. 
According to a CRS memo, The Universal Declaration of Human Rights was originally adopted in 1948 at the UN by 48 of the countries that belonged to the UN at that time (eight countries abstained). The Universal Declaration of Human Rights is considered 
as a part of the United Nations and any country who has joined since 1948 subscribes to its principles. No ratification is required. 
Some have suggested that it is inappropriate to elevate religion to a `higher' or `privileged' status in U.S. policy on human rights. But the reality is the opposite. We are trying to correct the neglect that has too long existed, where religious persecution has been given a lower priority than persecution based on political opinion, labor activities, sexual orientation, what have you. This bill is remedial for years of neglect. Religion must no longer be an afterthought of American human rights policy. 
As the Catholic Conference stated in its letter to me: 
The bill is a reasonable and thoughtful effort to ensure that religious liberty has its rightful place in U.S. policy while preserving the authority of the Executive to pursue legitimate foreign policy goals. It deserves broad, bipartisan support and should be considered before Congress adjourns. 
In June of this year, an Episcopalian Bishop from Pakistan, the Right Reverend Munawar Rumlash, or Bishop Manno as he is called in the United States, gave gripping testimony before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee about the plight of Christians in Pakistan. 
Bishop Manno cited the following examples of religious persecution in Pakistan before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that have occurred this year alone. 
In January, Protestant Pastor Noor Alam was stabbed to death in front of his family. Two months before his death, Pastor Alam's church was demolished by a Muslim mob. When he was stabbed to death he was in the process of rebuilding his church for which he had received several death threats. 
On April 27, 1998, Ayub Masih was condemned to death on charges he blasphemed the prophet Mohammed by favorably mentioning Salman Rushdie, the author of `Satanic Verses.' According to Freedom House, Mr. Rushdie's book has not been translated into the local Urdu language and is unavailable in Pakistan. It is improbable that Ayub Masih ever saw or read the book. 
The blasphemy laws in Pakistan do not just impact Christians. According to the latest State Department Human Rights Report, the Ahmadis, a minority sect of Islam that does not accept Mohammed as the last prophet of Islam, also suffer from the religious policies in Pakistan. 
Another country in the Middle East imprisoned some 30 Christians for distributing religious material just three months ago. There were credible reports that these people were beaten while in jail. 
In Nepal, Hinduism is the state religion and it is illegal to convert. Several years ago a gentleman from Oklahoma was arrested for distributing religious material. I worked with our government to get him released from prison. 
Just recently The American Coptic Association placed an ad in the Washington Times highlighting the trials that they are going through. I think there are something like 12 million Coptics in Egypt today. 
Last summer our Government prepared a report on countries that engage in violations of religious freedom. Some 77 countries were listed in that report. I will include that report at the conclusion of my statement. 
This is a problem, and we in the Senate have the power to try to do something to make improvements. That is what this bill is for. I believe the International Religious Freedom Act has the potential to significantly improve religious freedom throughout the world. 
Mr. President, what was a mere resolution in 1996, I hope will become a reality in 1998. While in 1996 we acted with words, I hope we can act now with deeds by passing the International Religious Freedom Act. 
I thank my colleague, Senator Lieberman, for his leadership, and Senator Coats, who has worked on this very, very hard, and the 29 cosponsors that we have on this bill. I urge my colleagues to look at this bill, and to work with us to see if we can't pass this bill and make a very positive statement as the United States being a real leader to promote religious freedom throughout the world. I thank my colleagues for their patience.

Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I yield myself 8 minutes. 
Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to vote in favor--I believe there is going to be a motion to table--I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of the motion to table the Kennedy amendment which will increase the minimum wage by 19 percent. Just 2 years ago we raised it 21 percent. 
I heard some of the proponents of the amendment say, `We need to increase minimum wage because if we don't, these people will not be able to make a decent living.' Frankly, I concur; if somebody needs to live on $5.15 an hour, that probably is not a very good living. But if you follow that philosophy through, then let's increase the minimum wage to $10 an hour or maybe $20 an hour. It just doesn't make sense. 
What are we doing if we increase minimum wage? Right now, the minimum wage is $5.15 an hour. There are 2.2 million people who make that amount. The proposal is to increase it to $6.15 an hour. According to CBO, there are 11.7 million workers who make less than $6.15 an hour. If we do that, we are saying it is against the law for them to work for less than $6.15 an hour--the Federal Government, in its wisdom, has decided that it is against the law for anybody in America to work for less than $6.15 an hour. I think that is a mistake. We are saying it is better for them not to have a job: `If that job doesn't pay $6.15 an hour, we would rather have them be unemployed.' The Federal Government makes it against the law. 
Do I want them to make $6.15 an hour? You bet. Do I want them to make more than $6.15 an hour? You bet. But I would hate to pass a law saying it is against the law for them to work for less than that. That is exactly what we are doing. Maybe this $6.15 an hour works in Massachusetts, but it may not work in rural Montana or in rural New Mexico. 
I am bothered by the fact that we are telling people if whatever job they have--and maybe it is a beginning job; a lot of minimum wage jobs are beginning jobs; maybe they are working part time in a restaurant, maybe they are pumping gas or sacking groceries or something--but basically the Federal Government is saying, `We would rather have you be unemployed; if your job doesn't pay this much, we would rather have you unemployed.' Then they are entitled to receive Government payments, welfare benefits, so on. 
To me, that just doesn't make sense. To go back on this poverty line and say, `If you don't make this money, it just is not worth it,' is hogwash. That is really devaluing the whole process of people starting to climb the economic ladder. We are saying if the job doesn't pay so much, we would rather you be unemployed. 
Sometimes that first job, even though it doesn't pay very much, is one of the most important jobs an individual can get, because they learn what it means to get a job, to be at work, to be on time. They learn maybe that that job doesn't pay enough, so they need to get a better job. Maybe they need to improve their skills or maybe they need to continue their education. 
To say we would rather have you be unemployed--whom does that really hurt? It hurts low-income people. It hurts minorities disproportionately. It basically leaves a lot of people with idle time who, frankly, would be better off making $5 an hour and having a job and learning some skills so they can get a better job in the future. Instead, we will be raising the 
ladder and saying, `No, we would rather have you be unemployed.' 
There they are, a 16-, 17-, 18-year-old person unemployed, maybe getting in trouble, maybe still wanting to have some money or something, so they get involved in doing other things. Sometimes those other things are illegal. 
Mr. President, you can't repeal the law of supply and demand. If you raise minimum wage, you are going to cost jobs, you are going to put people out of work, and, yes, the Congressional Budget Office says maybe it is 100,000, maybe it is 500,000. 
My daughter worked, and she was going to college. She was working in a restaurant as a waitress making $5 and something, I think--a little less than $6 an hour. At least she did when she started. I don't want the Federal Government to say, `We don't want her to have that job.' I don't want to price her out of getting that job. Unfortunately, she drives a car. I want her to help pay for that car. I want her to put gas in that car. 
Again, I think learning skills in whatever job level a person is able to start at--the higher the better, that is great. But if it is a minimum wage job, if it is a low-income-type job, if they are able to learn skills from that point, great. Let's not price it out of the ball park. Let's not put those people out on the unemployment lines. Let's not deprive a minority youngster who is 15 years old, or 16 years old, or 17 years old, in Chicago the chance to start climbing the economic ladder. 
Raising the minimum wage--I understand maybe the proponents' goal, and I share the goal of trying to raise people's incomes, but I want to do it through a free market, not do it through a Government mandate that is going to put hundreds of thousands of people out of work. 
Unfortunately, I think that is the net result of this amendment. If not, let's raise the minimum wage a lot more. I would like for everybody to make $10 an hour. If the economic arguments are valid behind raising this--if we raised it 21 percent 2 years ago, if we are going to raise it another 19 or 20 percent--if there is no negative economic impact, let's make it $10 or $20 an hour. Let's make sure everybody is going to be wealthy. Let's make sure nobody is on the poverty line. 
Frankly, that won't work. That just flat won't work. Most importantly, let's not deprive young people of the chance to climb the economic ladder. The hundreds of thousands, millions of these people who are making this level wage are people like my daughter. Let's give them a chance as well to start climbing the economic ladder. Let's not price it out. 
Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of the motion to table the Kennedy amendment at the proper time. I compliment my colleague from Utah and also my colleague from Vermont for their statements.

Mr. NICKLES. For the information of all of our colleagues, the Senate has resumed consideration of the bankruptcy bill and will hopefully make some progress on the remaining amendments to that bill. However, no further votes will occur during today's session. The Senate, as previously ordered, will have a tabling vote on the minimum wage issue on Tuesday. That vote will occur at 2:20 p.m. The vote at 2:20 on Tuesday will be the first vote of the week in observance of the Jewish holiday, Rosh Hashanah, which occurs on Monday. It is my hope that other amendments will be stacked in sequence to occur after the 2:20 p.m. vote. I appreciate all of my colleagues' consideration.

Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, the Senate again is considering the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act. This bill, which prohibits a procedure used to kill unborn children late in pregnancy in a particularly gruesome and painful manner, passed both the House and Senate before being vetoed by President Clinton on April 10, 1996. Last Congress, the House voted to override the President's veto by a vote of 285-137. Unfortunately, we failed in the Senate to override the Presidents' veto. The House voted again last year to prohibit partial-birth abortions by a veto proof margin of 295-136 and again the Senate passed the legislation by a vote of 64-36. However, President Clinton vetoed the ban for the second time. Today, the Senate again has the opportunity to over-ride the Presidents veto and put a stop to this horrific procedure. I rise to state my strong support for this just and very necessary legislation and hope that my Senate Colleagues will join with the House members and override the Presidents' veto. 
As I am sure all of my colleagues know by now, the procedure banned by this bill--the partial-birth abortion procedure--defies description. I am not going to go into the terrible details of this procedure, which is performed on a living child late in pregnancy. 
Mr. Presdient, this is a truly shocking procedure. It is absolutely indefensible. In fact, Dr. Pamela Smith, an obstetrician at Mt. Sinai Hospital in Chicago, and Director of Medical Education in the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology at that hospital, testified last Congress before the House Judiciary Subcommittee on the Constitution that even when describing the procedure to groups of pro-choice physicians she found that `many of them were horrified to learn that such a procedure was even legal.' [H. Rept. 104-267, p. 5] 
As Dr. Smith further points out, `partial birth abortion is a surgical technique devised by abortionists in the unregulated abortion industry to save them the trouble of `counting the body parts' that are produced in dismemberment procedures.' [Letter to U.S. Senators, 11/4/95] She says, in the same letter: `Opponents [have] insinuated that aborting a living human fetus is sometimes necessary to preserve the reproductive potential and/or life of the mother. Such an assertion is deceptively and patently untrue.' 
And what about the baby, is the baby exempt from the pain of this procedure? No. As stated in a August 26, 1998, report in the Journal of the American Medical Association: `When infants of similar gestational ages are delivered, pain management is an important part of the care rendered to them. However, with [this procedure] pain management is not provided for the fetus, who is literally within inches of being delivered. It is beyond ironic that the pain management practiced for [this procedure] on a human fetus would not meet the federal standards for the humane care of animals used in medical research.' 
In a July 9, 1995, letter to Congressman Tony Hall, a registered nurse who had observed as Dr. Haskell (who has performed over 1,000 partial-birth abortions) performed several partial-birth abortions described one such procedure: 
The baby's body was moving. His little fingers were clasping together. He was kicking his feet. All the while his little head was stuck inside. Dr. Haskell took a pair of scissors and inserted them into the back of the baby's head. Then he opened the scissors up. Then he stuck the high-powered suction tube into the hole and sucked the baby's brains out. 
President Clinton has claimed that for some women whose unborn babies are diagnosed with grave disorders, this procedure is the only way to prevent serious health damage. But according to the Physicians' Ad Hoc Coalition for Truth (PHACT), a coalition of about 500 medical specialists including former Surgeon General C. Everett Koop, even in cases involving such severe fetal disorders, `partial-birth abortion is never medically necessary to protect a mother's health or her future fertility.' (See The Wall Street Journal, Thursday, September 19, 1996, and PHACT press release dated May 7, 1997.) 
Not only is this procedure not medically necessary, but it actually is medically dangerous to the health of the mother! According to a recent article in American Medical News (March 3, 1997), Diana Grossheim, on her doctor's advice, opted for the partial-birth abortion technique to remove her 21 week old child who had died in utero. As a result, she now has an incompetent cervix which endangered a subsequent pregnancy and required bed rest from week 23 through the duration of her pregnancy. 
Furthermore, according to Dr. Pamela Smith, `there are absolutely no obstetrical situations encountered in this country which require a partially-delivered human fetus to be destroyed to preserve the health of the mother.' For example, performing a Caesarean section could produce a healthy mother and living child. (American Medical News, November 20, 1995) 
Even Dr. Warren Hern, an abortionist who specializes in late-term abortions, says that even he would not perform a partial-birth abortion because it is unsafe for the mother. He notes that turning the fetus to a breech position is `potentially dangerous' and that `you have to be concerned about causing amniotic fluid embolism or placental abruption if you do that.' (American Medical News, November 20, 1995) 
Dr. Martin Haskell, one of the major proponents and practitioners of this technique, states that some 80 percent of these procedures which he has performed were for `purely elective' reasons. [Interview with AMA's American Medical News, July 5, 1993] His late colleague and fellow proponent of the partial-birth method claimed in material submitted to the House subcommittee that `non-elective' reasons to perform the procedure include `psychiatric indications,' such as depression and `pediatric indications' (i.e., the mother is young). 
On January 12, 1997, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) issued a policy statement regarding this procedure stating they `could identify no circumstances under which this procedure . . . would be the only option to save the life or preserve the health of the woman.' In July, 1997, the ACOG Executive Board supplemented its policy on abortion toward stating, `ACOG is opposed to abortion of the healthy fetus that has attained viability in a healthy woman.' 
The American Medical Association, on May 19, 1997 wrote to support H.R. 1122, the Partial Birth Abortion Ban. And, on May 26, 1997, AMA President Daniel H. Johnson. Jr. M.D., stated `The partial delivery of a living fetus for the purpose of killing it outside the womb is ethically offensive to most Americans and physicians. Our panel could not find any identified circumstances in which the procedure was the only safe and effective abortion method.' 
The stark fact is that unless this bill becomes law, more innocent unborn children will have their lives brutally ended by the inhumane partial-birth procedure. During last year's debate the New York Times quoted the pro-choice National Abortion Federation, as saying that only about 450 partial-birth abortions are performed each year. 
Well, everyone now knows that was a lie! In February this year, Ron Fitzsimmons, the executive director of the National Coalition for Abortion Providers, said he lied about the frequency and necessity of partial-birth procedures. He now admits that this procedure is performed 3,000 to 5,000 times a year with the vast majority being performed during the fifth and sixth months of pregnancy, on healthy babies of healthy mothers. (New York Times, 2-26-97; March 3, 1997, American Medical News.) 
In addition, two lengthy investigative reports published last year in the Washington Post and the Record of Hackensack, New Jersey, reporters for both newspapers found that the procedure is far more common than pro-abortion groups have claimed, and is typically performed for non-medical reasons. 
The Record found, for example, that a single abortion clinic in Englewood, N.J., performs `at least 1,500' partial-birth abortions a year--three times the number that the National Abortion Federation had claimed occur annually in the entire country. Doctors at the Englewood clinic said that only a `minuscule amount' are for medical reasons. One of the abortion doctors at that clinic told the Record, `Most are Medicaid patients, black and white, and most are for elective, not medical reasons: People who didn't realize, or didn't care, how far along they were. Most are teenagers.' 
It is unbelievable to me that this unspeakable abortion procedure even exists in this country, much less that we are having to take legislative action to ban such a procedure. It is further unbelievable to me that anyone in good conscience can even defend the partial-birth abortion procedure. It is a fiction to believe that it is alright to end the life of a baby whose body, except the head, is fully delivered. In order to engage in such a fiction, one has to take the position that curling fingers and kicking legs have no life in them. Those who subscribe to such a fiction, are at best, terribly misguided. 
As Former Surgeon General C. Everett Koop stated:  
. . . in no way can I twist my mind to see that the late-term abortion as described--you know, partial birth and then destruction of the unborn child before the head is born--is a medical necessity for the mother. It certainly can't be a necessity for the baby. American Medical News, August 19, 1996. 
Even a Chicago Tribune March 3, 1997 editorial stated: 
The American people have learned enough about partial-birth abortions to know that they should be stopped. 
Twenty-eight states have approved a ban on partial birth abortions. Now it is time for the Senate to do the same. It is time to end this injustice and the practice of this inhumane procedure. I urge my colleagues to join me in ending this atrocity.

Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I want to compliment my colleague, Senator Domenici, as well as Senator Hutchison, for their leadership on this issue. 
Mr. President, I want to correct what I hear from my colleagues, the proponents of this amendment, and make a couple of statements that I think are factual. 
One, I think I heard somebody say on the other side--Senator Durbin--that there were not any hearings. We had a hearing. I conducted the hearing. I don't conduct hearings very often, but when this issue came up, I knew a hearing was needed. Some people have demagogued this issue and tried to use it for whatever purposes, political or otherwise. I wanted to know the facts. I am chairman of the relevant subcommittee in the Energy Committee so we scheduled a hearing. We had the hearing, I believe, in June of this year. 
There are just a couple of points that I would like to make. One, in testimony before the House subcommittee, the director of MMS said the purpose of the regulations were not to raise money. She said, that the regulations are to be revenue neutral. I hear all of the list of the groups who are supposedly proponents of the Boxer amendment--schoolboards and so on--thinking they are going to get a lot more money. The proposed regulations are supposed to be revenue neutral. It is not supposed to raise any money. Proponents are saying, `Oh well. If we don't pass this amendment, the schoolboard is going to be out of some money,' and so on. That is false. It is not the case. It is contrary to what the director of MMS has testified to. 
I don't happen to agree with the director of MMS, or the Assistant Secretary of the Interior in proposing this oil valuation regulation. I think they have gone too far. I happen to like Mr. Armstrong. But I don't think their regulation makes sense. That is one of the reasons we had hearings. 
One of the things we don't do enough of in the Senate and House is we don't have oversight over our various agencies. A lot of times the agencies propose rules and regulations, and sometimes those rules and regulations don't make sense. They may be well intended, and they may have stated goals of simplicity, clarity, and definability, but they may do just exactly the opposite. 
Unfortunately, the regulations that MMS has come up with--at least according to the people who work in the industry--the regulations won't clarify anything. They won't even raise the Government any money--maybe not as much money as they are raising right now. What they will raise is litigation. That doesn't help anybody. That doesn't help the Government. That doesn't help the schoolboard. That doesn't help the tribes. That doesn't help the States or anybody, except for maybe the lawyers who are involved in the litigation. 
Some of us have looked at this. This is one of the regulations that we need to review. I mentioned that we had a hearing. Several of us have had meetings with members of the administration, the Department of the Interior, and MMS proponents of this regulation, and people who work in the industry. We tried to pull them together. 
Both Senators from Louisiana, both Senators from New Mexico, Senator Hutchison from Texas, and myself have met with MMS and said, `Can't we figure this out? Can't we come up with workable, definable, clearly understandable regulations on how to determine royalty evaluations?' We have had interesting meetings. But, unfortunately, sometimes it appears that MMS is not really listening to some of the complaints and really hasn't made the necessary changes to the regulations to make them workable. 
I would take issue with some of my colleagues who said, `Well, these big oil companies, they are cheating, they are selling to an affiliate, and they lowball the price, and they make more money, and the Government is being cheated.' 
I do not think that is the case. If it is the case, the government has every right to take the company to court, and maybe they can win. 
What we want to do is have clarity. We want to have definability. We want people to pay exactly what they owe in royalties--not a dime more, not a dime less. And that is our objective. It is easier said than done. And the MMS came up with some proposed regulations. They said, `Oh, well, we will put out some prices that are on the exchange, and that will be what the royalty will be based on, on that given date.' 
But wait a minute. What if there is an arm's length transaction where somebody actually bought and sold? Maybe they didn't buy or sell at the same price posted on the exchange. Market valuation on some exchanges is based on some transactions, but you have some transactions below it and some above it; you have some transactions that might be a little higher because of a little different weight of oil or different grade of oil or a transportation problem or a little different sulfur content. There are lots of variables in the equation. 
So to have some bureaucrat say, well, I am going to pick this market index or this posted price somewhere and that will be the value of what the Federal Government will be paid on instead of the actual value of an arm's length transaction, that doesn't make sense. I will tell you, in my own State we have several different prices on different types of oil. We have Texas crude; we have Oklahoma sweet, Texas sweet; we have Cushing prices; we have a lot of different prices, posted prices, and so on. 
So I just mention to my colleagues, I don't think the oil companies are trying to cheat anybody. I think the proposed regulations are not clear; they need to be clarified. We need to work with MMS to try to come up with better regulations that are clear and work. They haven't done it yet. And their proposal leaves a lot to be desired. Their proposal would result in more litigation, and that is not going to help any schoolboard in the country. 
And so I think we have the responsibility in Congress as maybe the countervailing branch of Government, the branch of Government that listens to our constituents when we find a regulatory agency that is not listening, that is not working, that is not promulgating regulations that will work, to get their attention. We have an obligation to make them work with us to come up with something that is reasonable and sound. And if they continue to come up with regulations that will not work, that do not make sense, then we should stop that. This is called checks and balances. It is called balance of power. We cannot allow regulatory agencies to run amok. 
And so I think we have a constitutional responsibility to try to make some progress in this area. If we find regulatory agencies that are not doing what they are supposed to be doing, we should hold them in check. That is what this provision, that the Senator from California is trying to strike, strives to do. This provision doesn't say that MMS cannot go further on their proposed regulations. It basically says let's put out regulations that are reasonable and sound. And many of us have tried to facilitate meetings to make that happen. 
My colleagues on the other side said that this proposed rule exempts 95 percent of the companies. Independents are not covered. Independents tell me they are covered. The regulations are written for all oil producers; 100 percent of all oil producers are covered by these regulations. Some of my colleagues have said: Oh, no; it just applies to those companies who are selling to marketing affiliates. Guess what. More and more companies today are selling into a company that maybe they have a little piece of or something--a natural gas marketing company, an oil marketing company, and so on. They are banding together in these types of organizations. And so this regulation certainly reaches, I would say--I don't know what percentage, but according to the independent petroleum producers--I happen to think they would know more about it than anybody else--it says 100 percent. The independent producers say in a memo, `Percentage of oil producers impacted by the proposed oil royalty rule, 100 percent.' I happen to think they know what they are talking about. 
And so again I compliment my colleagues, Senator Hutchison and Senator Domenici, for including this provision in this bill. I think they are right in doing so. I think MMS needs to work with Congress and with the affected parties to make sure that every company pays exactly what they owe--no more, no less. 
If colleagues are interested in trying to raise money, they should try to raise the royalty rate, and we can have a debate on that. That is certainly within their rights. I don't think they will be successful, but they have the right to try that. But to try to raise the royalty rates by changing the regulations or trying to change the regulations in a way so that they will raise money is a tax increase by a regulatory agency, I reject that emphatically. Congress has the power to raise taxes, not some unelected bureaucrat in the Minerals Management Service. 
To all the arguments that our colleagues from California and others made, that this proposed regulation is going to raise so much money and it is going to help schools, and so on--no; what we have to do is make sure that every company pays exactly what they owe--no more, no less. The current system is not correct. It needs to be improved. However, the regulations proposed by the MMS do not fit the bill. They need to be revised. We are trying to get their attention so they will revise those rules in a workable, definable, understandable way that is clear, so that everyone will know exactly what should be paid and will pay that much and no more. 
Mr. President, again I thank my colleagues for their efforts, and I urge my colleagues to support our effort to defeat the amendment of our colleague from California.

Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, first, I wish to compliment my colleague from Arkansas for bringing this bill to the floor. I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of it. In response to my colleague from Minnesota, I think he should read the legislation. In reading the legislation, the protection of employer rights, section 8(a) of the NLRA is amended on line 22 to read: 
Nothing in this subsection shall be construed as requiring an employer to employ any person who is not a bona fide employee applicant, in that such person seeks or has sought employment with the employer with the primary purpose of furthering another employment or agency status: Provided, That this sentence shall not affect the rights and responsibilities under this Act of any employee who is or was a bona fide employee applicant, including the right to self-organization, to form, join, or assist labor organizations, to bargain collectively through representatives of their own choosing, and to engage in other concerted activities for the purpose of collective bargaining. . . . 
Mr. President, under the legislation my colleague from Arkansas has, an employee can come in, and if they want to help organize or participate in the collective bargaining process, they can do so. But they have to have the primary purpose of employment, of working with the employer. It can't be to circumvent and say, no, we want to work full time for the union, even to the destruction of the company. 
Unfortunately, that happens today to some companies that might be nonunion. The organizers who are trying to unionize the company sometimes say, `We would rather destroy that company if they are not going to be union.' I will read you one comment that was in the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers' organizing document on how to use salting techniques: 
Phase 3 is infiltration, confrontation, litigation, disruption, and annihilation of all nonunion contractors. If we cannot get inside and organize, then we must disrupt the operations of the nonunion contractor. 
That is a quote. I understand they have now taken that out of their organizational manual. But, in essence, they want to infiltrate and do everything they can to disrupt, and that means filing untold numbers of unfair labor practices. That means filing untold numbers of OSHA complaints, and any other thing to disrupt the company and make them an unsuccessful organization. Unfortunately that happens. 
I have a letter from one of my small companies in Oklahoma, dated May 29, 1998. He is telling a story and talking about filing false and incorrect reports with the NLRB: 
We hired an attorney to represent us in these proceedings. Each time, we had proof, and sometimes outside witnesses, to prove our side of the story. 
It goes on and on and on and talks about harassment. So I compliment my colleague from Arkansas. I think he is exactly right. I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of this bill. 
Mr. President, I have two editorials. One is dated June 8 of this year, from the Daily Oklahoman, entitled `Salt, Not Light.' It repeats the real essence of this legislation, why it is needed. Also, I have one that was in today's Washington Times, entitled `Pass the Salt Reform.' It is dated Monday, September 14.

Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, first, I will make a couple comments concerning those made by some of our Democratic colleagues who said they want to bring up the Patients' Bill of Rights. We have offered throughout the month of July to bring up the Patients' Bill of Rights. I will make a unanimous consent request to do it again. Unfortunately, our Democratic colleagues haven't been able to take yes for an answer. In other words, I think they want to debate an issue, discuss an issue, have unlimited amendments, and we are not going to give them that. 
We only have 22 days left in this legislative session. We tried to get this up and considered and done in July. They wouldn't accept that request. 
In just a moment, I am going to make a unanimous consent request to bring it up with limited amendments. I will tell my colleagues, it will be three amendments a side. You can design any amendment any way you want. You can offer your proposal in any way that you want. We are going to give you an up-or-down vote on your proposal; we are going to have an up-or-down vote on our proposal. That is going to be in my request. You would have the right to do three amendments; we would have the right to do three amendments. 
It is the same request that we made in July. If you want this issue to be considered and passed, that is the way to do it. If you want to say we want to have this issue on the floor all month, as was the unanimous consent request made by the minority leader, that is not going to happen. Or to say that we are going to take up the House bill and work off the House bill, that is not going to happen. 
So, again, I tell my colleagues, if you want to consider the bill, and if you want it passed, the Patients' Bill of Rights, we are willing to do it. What I hear our friends on the Democratic side say is, `We know we don't have the votes so we want to talk about it.' And sometimes I think it is important if you are going to talk about the issue that you speak truthfully. Unfortunately, I do not think the President did that in his radio address. 
The President, in his radio address on Saturday, frankly--I am going to come back to that issue shortly because I know my friend from Kentucky wants to go back to the bill. I am going to come back later to the floor and analyze the President's speech or his radio address where he talked about the Patients' Bill of Rights, and he characterized what the Republican bill did. And he was flat wrong. I think he should know the truth. And maybe his staff should do better work or they should quit trying to politicize this issue and he should speak factually what is in our bill and what is in his bill. Unfortunately, that did not happen on Saturday.

<TEXT>
Mr. NICKLES. No, I will not yield. I will yield in a moment. 
Another thing that galls this Senator is if and when the President thinks he can legislate by radio address. The President is the Chief Executive Officer in the country, but under the Constitution he does not have legislative powers to legislate by Executive order or to legislate by radio address. I think, frankly, he crossed that line again on Saturday. That is unfortunate. 
If he wants legislation, we are willing to consider legislation. The President talked about having internal appeals and so on. We have internal appeals in our bill. We have external appeals in our bill. So if the President likes that provision, he can take it up. And he should urge our colleagues on the Democratic side of the aisle to take this legislation up and pass it. We are giving a reasonable unanimous consent request to bring it up. So I just hope that, again, common sense would prevail and that we would take the legislation up under a reasonable time limit. 
I mention that the counteroffer that we received in July was not three amendments a side; it was 20 amendments a side. That would be 40 amendments. That is ridiculous. That is not going to happen. I want to pass this legislation. Frankly, I have invested a lot of time in this legislation, as well as Senator Frist and Senator Collins, Senator Jeffords, Senator Gramm--many of our colleagues--Senator Santorum. We worked for months on this legislation. 
I also want to take just a little issue with our friend from Illinois. He said, `Isn't it true that the Republican bill left out millions of Americans?' That is false. We gave every single American that has an employer-sponsored plan an internal appeal and external appeal. And that is not in current law. We believe it should be legislated, not deemed by Executive order. And so to say, `Well, they don't have protections under the Republican bill' is absolutely false. 
We do not have 300-some mandates as proposed by the Democrat bill. We do not have 56 new causes of action where really it would say it would be health care by litigation. We have health care to be determined by physicians, not by trial attorneys. 
So, yes, there is a difference between the bills. We are saying: Fine. You have a legislative proposal. We will let you offer it. We will find out where the votes are. We have a legislative proposal. We will offer it and find out where the votes are, and maybe offer a couple of amendments. And we can dispose of the bill. We can pass the bill. We can go to conference with the House, hopefully work out the differences with the House. 
Mr. President, at this time I ask unanimous consent that the majority leader, after notification of the Democratic leader, shall turn to Senate bill S. 2330 regarding health care. I further ask that immediately upon its reporting, Senator Nickles be recognized to offer a substitute amendment making technical changes to the bill, and immediately following the reporting by the clerk, Senator Kennedy be recognized to offer his Patients' Bill of Rights amendment, with votes occurring on each amendment, with all points of order having been waived. I further ask that three other amendments be in order to be offered by each leader or their designee regarding health care, and following the conclusion of debate and following the votes with respect to the listed amendments, the bill be advanced to third reading, and the Senate proceed to H.R. 4250, the House companion bill, that all after the enacting clause be stricken, and the text of S. 2330, as amended, be inserted, and the Senate proceed to a vote. I further ask that following the vote, the Senate bill be returned to the calendar.

Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I regret that my colleague from Massachusetts has objected to our unanimous consent request to bring this bill up. Obviously, he has some concerns, but he does not have the votes. 
We have offered to vote on his proposal. He can draft his proposal any way he wants. We have drafted our proposal. We want to vote on our proposal. We want to pass our proposal. 
We will give him an up-or-down vote on his proposal. We will offer and have offered that he can have two or three amendments, and we can have two or three amendments. We can finish this bill. He can draft those amendments in any way, shape or form he wants to and address any and all issues he has addressed today that might be in this letter or another letter. I hope he will do better work in the letter than the President did in his radio address. He was factually incorrect in that. I happen to be offended by that. I just make that comment. 
To reiterate, we offered to bring this up in July. My colleague from Tennessee and I and others wanted to finish it in July because we know we have a difficult conference with the House. This is not the easiest legislation to consider. So it is important to move sooner rather than later, as I think I heard my colleague from South Dakota mention. So I hope we will bring it up. But we are going to have to have cooperation from our colleagues. If they continue to insist on unlimited amendments, to where they can debate this issue all month, that is not going to happen. They will be successful in killing this bill, not the Republicans. 
I yield to my colleague from Tennessee.

Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I come to the floor today with a very sober, very serious discussion. That concerns the role, the effectiveness, and the job that the Attorney General of the United States is currently doing. The Attorney General, under title 28 of the U.S. Code, section 515, is vested as the chief law enforcement officer of the country. That is a very important vesting of power. She is the chief law enforcement officer of the country. She has the responsibility of making sure the laws are carried out, as part of the executive branch. 
Congress, some time ago, realized that every once in a while there might be a conflict of enforcing the law strictly, if there are allegations of impropriety with members of the executive branch, so the independent counsel statute was passed. It was passed as a follow-up to Watergate. Can you really investigate your own boss? Can the Attorney General investigate the President or Vice President or some other Cabinet official because they are serving with those individuals at their pleasure? As a matter of fact, Attorney General Reno was appointed and confirmed by the Senate in, I believe, 1993; and then there was some speculation she would be reconfirmed or reappointed by the President, and subsequently she was. 
Since that time, I think all of my colleagues, and certainly all the country, know that this administration has had a lot of legal conflicts and problems. One of the biggest issues was the issue of campaign finance. Both the House and Senate have conducted hearings. I presently serve on the Governmental Affairs Committee that conducted an investigation all of last year over alleged campaign finance abuses. The committee, at least amongst the majority of the committee, albeit mostly Republicans, said, yes, there should be an independent counsel appointed. We made that recommendation to the Attorney General. She has ignored that recommendation, and regrettably so. 
Mr. President, I might mention a few things. I said she is in charge of making sure the laws are enforced. I am looking at one, and I could spend hours going through the law and stating allegations that I think this administration was in violation of, that she has not enforced, or to give reason for the appointment of an independent counsel so there would not be this conflict of interest. I will mention a couple of laws. 
Title 18, section 607, United States Code, states in clear and unequivocal terms: 
It should be unlawful for any person to solicit or receive any contribution in a Federal building. 
I could go on and mention the conflict of covered persons. Covered persons under this statute are the President, the Vice President. Vice President Gore has now admitted to making 52 fundraising calls from the White House. And the so-called coffees: There were 103 coffees in the White House attended by 1,241 people. They raised $26.4 million and I think are in direct violation of the statute. President Clinton hosted an average of two coffees per week during the reelection cycle; Vice President Gore attended over 100 coffees in 22 months before the election; 92 percent of the coffee attendees contributed to the DNC in the 1996 election cycle. 
I could mention the overnighters. President Clinton, in a handwritten note to a memo on January 5, 1995, told his staff he is `ready to start the overnights right away' and asked for a list of $100,000 and $50,000 contributors. Altogether, there were 178 guests who were listed as long-time friends, public officials or dignitaries, or Arkansas friends, who contributed over $5 million to the DNC. Overnight DNC donors paid an average of $44,000 per family to sleep in the Lincoln Bedroom. The White House was for sale, I think in clear violation of the law, Mr. President.

Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, keep in mind that was last year, when the campaign investigation was going, and going very strongly. She had this to say concerning the investigation. She was talking about the investigators: 
Since they've begun their work, I have met with them regularly to hear what they found and ask them questions. I check on their progress several times a week discussing with them what evidence they have found and how they are proceeding. Most important of all, I told them from the start that they are to contact me immediately if they ever believe that evidence and law justify triggering the independent counsel statute. I and Director Freeh check with them regularly to ensure they have adequate resources. 
Later in her statement: 
As I stated then, the fact that we don't trigger a preliminary investigation under the act does not mean we are not investigating the matter. We are fully prepared to trigger the Independent Counsel Act and pursue any evidence that a covered person committed a crime if any should arise in the course of our investigation. We continue to investigate every transaction brought to our attention. We will not close the investigation of a matter without Director Freeh and I signing on its closure. 
She made a commitment that basically the major decisions would be made by the Attorney General and the FBI Director, former Federal judge, Mr. Freeh. I mention that because evidently Mr. Freeh made a detailed report, evidently a 27-page report, to the Attorney General in November of 1997 calling for an independent counsel. I am not inserting that report in the Record. I am going to read a couple of excerpts that Senator Thompson made before the Judiciary Committee, where Attorney General Reno testified on July 15 of this year, where he outlined several things that were in Director Freeh's memo. 
I will be very quick and maybe I will insert several pages of this in the Record. This is Senator Thompson talking about Director Freeh's investigation. He pointed out that the FBI's investigation has led them to the highest levels of the White House, including the Vice President and the President, and that the Department of Justice must look at the independent counsel statute. He pointed out there are two sections; one is a mandatory section where the Attorney General is required to appoint, and another one is a discretionary section. The ultimate conclusion by Mr. Freeh is that the statute should be triggered under both the mandatory and the discretionary provisions of the statute. 
</TEXT>
</DOC>

<DOC>
<DOCNO>105-nickles-ok-3-19980731</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
Mr. NICKLES. He discussed in detail Vice President Gore's telephone conversations, the President's telephone solicitations, the need for independent counsel in both cases. 
It is the Director's ultimate conclusion it should be referred to an appointment of an independent counsel as part of a broader scheme to circumvent campaign finance law under either the mandatory or the discretionary provisions of the statute. He held the same conclusion with regard to White House coffees, the overnights, and other perks, and that would include Air Force One. 
He also talks about the scheme to evade the law. When the President agrees to take public funding of a Presidential campaign, he says: Here is how much money we are going to raise and spend. Clearly, the White House, and Mr. Harold Ickes and other people, tried to circumvent the law and say: We are going to raise lots and lots of money, the White House will do it, and we will basically get around these limits. Director Freeh obviously thinks that should be investigated and may well think it should be investigated for both parties. I am not making any aspersions. I am just saying that we should have an independent counsel. 
If Director Freeh has studied this as long as he has--he is the chief investigative officer of the country as head of the FBI--if it is his strong conclusion, with a 27-page memo, that we should have an independent counsel, then we should have an independent counsel. He gave that memo evidently in November of last year, and the Attorney General has yet to appoint an independent counsel. 
I could go on. I have already inserted most of this into the Record. I will skip and just make the comment that if you have the Director of the FBI--I think his concluding comment, and I will quote this from Senator Thompson's statement:  
It is difficult to imagine a more compelling situation for appointing an independent counsel. 
That is from Director Freeh. That is not a partisan Republican. That is from a former Federal judge who is now Director of the FBI, who made that analysis after conducting a very extensive investigation. He says we need an independent counsel. I think the Attorney General should follow his advice. 
Now we have, evidently, the chief investigator that the Attorney General appointed in the Justice Department making the same recommendation. Again, I haven't read his memo. Evidently, he just issued a memo--this is prosecutor Charles La Bella. This is according to news reports. I will insert this in the Record. This is July 23, 1998--recently--written by David Johnson. It says: 
Prosecutor Charles La Bella delivered a report to Reno last Thursday as he prepared to return to San Diego this week to take over as interim U.S. attorney. La Bella has marked his department by challenging her to replace him with an outside counsel. 
I will read one section: 
But he contends only that their fundraising activities warrant outside investigation, and in the legal analysis La Bella concluded that Reno misinterpreted the law, creating an artificially high standard to avoid invoking the independent counsel statute. 
It also goes on in the article to say that, last fall, La Bella urged her to seek appointment of an independent counsel to investigate fundraising telephone calls by President Clinton and Vice President Gore but she rejected that recommendation. In summary, La Bella concluded there was sufficient information to warrant appointment based on mandatory and discretionary provisions in the independent counsel statute, meaning he found enough specific information to justify outside investigation of high officials. 
He found that the Justice Department could not objectively investigate them on his own, the official said.

Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, we have the House Judiciary Committee, we have the Senate Judiciary Committee, we have the Governmental Affairs Committee all saying we should have an independent counsel. That was all done last year. We have the head of the FBI saying we should have an independent counsel, and we have the special prosecutor, brought in by Attorney General Reno herself to head up the investigation, saying we should have an independent counsel. They all came to the same conclusion that there was enough campaign abuse or alleged violations of the law that we should have an independent counsel to avoid the conflict of interest to investigate this matter further. 
It is unanimous, with one exception--Attorney General Reno. In her comments, following Mr. La Bella's remarks, since that was made public, she says, `Well, we want to discuss this with all of our attorneys. He was just one attorney.' He was the lead attorney. He was the chief investigator. And Director Freeh is not just an attorney, he happens to be the Director of the FBI. And if he issued a 27-page report calling for an independent counsel, I think she should adhere to it. 
I am bothered by the fact that if we had the chief law enforcement officer of the country not enforcing the law, not listening to the recommendations of her chief investigator, Mr. La Bella, not following the recommendations of the Director of the FBI, then I do not think she is enforcing the law. And that bothers me. 
So, Mr. President, it is with some regret--I do not do this very often--but I think if Attorney General Reno does not appoint a special counsel under the independent counsel statute to investigate campaign abuses by this administration, I think she should resign. I do not think she is doing her job. I think she is involved in more of a coverup of the President's activities or the White House's activities than she is enforcing the law. 
I hope she will change her mind. I hope she will review the memo that Director Freeh and Mr. La Bella have given her and follow their advice. Those two individuals are not partisan Republicans. They are not the chairman of the Republican Judiciary Committee or the House Judiciary Committee or they are not Senator Thompson or other members on the Governmental Affairs Committee. They are appointees by this administration. I give them great credibility. I hope that she will follow their advice. Mr. President----

Mr. NICKLES. I appreciate the question by my friend and colleague. As I stated in my statement, one, I hope--I prefaced, I said if she does not appoint, if she does not appoint an independent counsel, then I think she should resign. And it is my hope that she will follow the wisdom of Director Freeh and Mr. La Bella, follow their advice and appoint an independent counsel. I hope she will enforce the law. 
As my colleague from Pennsylvania is aware, I think the law is very clear. The one you mentioned with the coffees, the statute says: It shall be unlawful for any person to solicit or receive any contribution in a Federal building. The statute is pretty clear. It just has not been enforced. 
I appreciate your statement. I think if she resigned--whoever is acting--before any person would be confirmed by the Senate, we would try to have a very clear understanding that the law would be enforced. 
I would also mention--you mentioned John Huang. John Huang was in the White House 164 times. That is a lot of visits for a person who was primarily a fundraiser. I think clearly the law was abused; campaign abuses were very flagrant. And the law should be enforced. 
Hopefully, the Attorney General will take heed of the advice that the Senate Judiciary Committee, the House Judiciary Committee, the Governmental Affairs Committee, the investigative committee in the House, and as well as the FBI Director and her chief prosecutor, Mr. La Bella, have given, and follow that advice with the appointment of an independent counsel. I think it would help relieve her of a lot of criticism. And I think it would be the right thing to do. I think it would be enforcing the laws as the law is written. 
Mr. President, I again thank my colleague from West Virginia for his courtesy and also for his patience. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, first, I compliment my colleague from Alabama for bringing this amendment because it is a really good, commonsense amendment. 
I might mention to our colleagues, yesterday we voted to exempt credit unions from the Community Reinvestment Act. Most of us support that amendment. I supported that amendment. I mentioned to somebody that said I am not sure we should do that because banks have to comply, and I said we have the Shelby amendment that will at least exempt small banks. 
Most of my banks in the State of Oklahoma are small banks. They don't need the Federal Government to tell them to invest in their community--they do it anyway. If you have a meeting with your bankers in your State, particularly your small bankers, they will tell you the Community Reinvestment Act is one of the most bureaucratic messes they deal with. They really don't have to have the Federal Government to tell them to invest in their own community. So now we are going to say we will exempt credit unions from the CRA, but we will not exempt small banks? That is not fair. That is not equitable. 
Senator Shelby's amendment would correct that for the small banks. I compliment him for doing it. I think now is the time to do it. We are going to create greater inequities between credit unions and banks; I don't think that is fair. So Senator Shelby's amendment would at least provide relief for small banks. That is the right thing to do. It is the timely thing to do. 
The fact that the President says he might veto--if we pass this by an overwhelming vote, and if we have the Shelby amendment, it would be passed overwhelmingly, it would be adopted by the House, and I think the President would see the wisdom of signing the bill as amended with the Shelby amendment. 
I thank my colleague from Alabama.

Mr. NICKLES. The amendment I send to the desk on behalf of myself, Senator Inhofe, and Senator Sessions would try to bring some balance on what we pay for court-appointed attorneys in Federal death penalty cases. Right now, we find out that in a case conducted in Colorado, the so-called McVeigh case, Oklahoma City bombing case, the defense attorneys--these are court-appointed, taxpayer-financed attorneys--are compensated at a rate much higher than we pay U.S. attorneys. 
I wasn't aware of this. I didn't know about it until the U.S. attorneys from Oklahoma mentioned to me that in some cases court-appointed defenders are paid at rates maybe three, four, or maybe five times as much as they are paid. 
Just to give you the figures, the U.S. attorneys in most places around the country are paid $118,000. 
A court-appointed defense attorney is paid $125 an hour. In some of these cases, like the Oklahoma City bombing case, it is not unreasonable that they might work 80 hours or more per week. That means they make $10,000 a week. A U.S. attorney makes $10,000 a month--actually, a little less than that. So the essence of this amendment is that we should not compensate court-appointed attorneys more than we pay U.S. attorneys. I might mention that in the Oklahoma City case, we had a court-appointed attorney and I think 13 assistants, all of whom would be eligible to receive these large sums. 
So I thank my colleague, Senator Sessions, who is a former U.S. attorney, and also my colleague, Senator Inhofe. I hope we can adopt this amendment.

Mr. NICKLES. If the Senator will yield, I want to make clear that what we are talking about is compensation. We are talking about payments, not about overhead. The Senator from New Hampshire mentioned that in these Federal cases expenses are allowed. I am talking about compensation. I also might mention that, in Oklahoma, I compared what we pay in Oklahoma for a capital case; there is a $20,000 cap--$20,000 to the lead attorney, and for co-counsel, $5,000. 
I might mention, on other cases on the Federal level--for a felony case, we have caps at $3,500. All I am talking about is having a cap equal to the salary. So we are talking salaries, not about other benefits.

Mr. NICKLES. To respond to my colleague, we are talking about so much, not per case, but per attorney. We didn't limit the number of attorneys. We just didn't want to be in a situation where a U.S. attorney is hiring additional counsel and to have the defense counsel say, `Hey, we can pay three or four times more. Come fight on our side of the case.' 
Right now, in the case of the Oklahoma City bombing case, the defense attorneys made--I am not talking about expenses--they individually made probably three or four times as much as U.S. attorneys. I think that is inequitable. I am talking about what they receive in take-home pay, per attorney.

Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, certainly, my colleague has a right to oppose the amendment. Let me capsulize it again. We have a situation where Federal death penalty cases--most of them are handled in the States and most States have caps. My State has a cap of $20,000 for the lead attorney. We are not doing that. We are not capping what somebody can pay for their private attorneys. They can pay their private attorney anything they want to. 
Since we are talking about court-appointed attorneys, they are going to be paid for by the taxpayers, like we pay U.S. attorneys. I am saying that we should not pay that individual--their compensation, not their overhead or expenses; those are other items--three or four times as much 
as we pay the U.S. attorneys. 
I didn't even say we would limit the number of attorneys. I want people to have an adequate defense. In the McVeigh case, the defense counsel had 13 or 14 attorneys. The expenses are going to come out and be public, and people will be outraged. I am trying to have basic equity. I don't think they should make more than a U.S. attorney. I think that is a real outrage. Then when you find out they might have made three or four times as much money as a U.S. attorney--and again, I am not talking about expenses, I am talking about what they make--that is an injustice. We need equity and balance. That is why I have proposed this amendment. I hope my colleagues will vote for it. 
Mr. President, my colleague from South Carolina says U.S. attorneys almost make as much as U.S. Senators. Most of us work a little more than 40 hours a week. Again, I just urge my colleagues to support the amendment. I will ask for the yeas and nays if my colleague from New Mexico wants them.

<TEXT>
Mr. NICKLES. I appreciate my colleague yielding for a moment. I sat here and waited for awhile for my colleague from Massachusetts to speak, and then the Senator from Delaware decided to speak. I wanted to make a couple of comments concerning the health care legislation. 
One, I regret maybe some of the tone of some of the debate that has been made. I am very interested in trying to come up with a reasonable time agreement to take up this legislation. We have offered to do that. We have offered to give a vote on both the Democrat and the Republican proposals. I understand my colleague wants more time. He probably would like to spend a month on it. I heard him say it is the most important legislation we have before the Senate. I think I heard him say the same thing about the tobacco legislation. We spent 4 weeks on tobacco legislation, and we are not going to spend 4 weeks on this. The Senate is scheduled to be in session about 5 additional weeks, so we don't have the luxury of time that maybe we have had in the past. 
My colleague from Massachusetts made the comment and said we tried to bring this up 18 months ago. That is not correct. His bill was introduced on March 31. Three days later, he was trying to pass a sense-of-the-Senate resolution, saying we will pass it this year. We have agreed to bring it up this year. We have agreed to give it adequate time for debate. We have not agreed to spend an unlimited amount of time on this. 
I want to respond to a couple of the statements that were made concerning the Republican proposal. Much to my chagrin, I had hoped my colleague, and colleagues on the other side, would try to find out what is good and maybe see where we can move forward, but instead he has trashed our proposal. I resent that, or I regret it--I guess regret would be the more proper terminology. 
We have 49 cosponsors of this legislation. We had a task force that met for months, 7 months, to formulate positive, constructive health care legislation, legislation that would help alleviate some of the problems in the health care industry, legislation that would help protect those people who don't have protections in health care. 
I heard my colleague say their plan only affects 48 million Americans and exempts two-thirds. That is absolutely not correct. The facts are, every single ERISA-covered plan, every single employer-sponsored health plan in America would have an appeal process. It is a different process than our colleagues on the Democrat side have followed, but for a good reason. We don't want to drive up health care costs. 
What we want to do is make sure people who are denied health care will have an appeal to where they can get health care--not that they have to go to court to get a health care decision--so they can have an appeal through an outsider who has nothing whatever to do with their case and have it be reviewed immediately or expeditiously if there is a serious health care problem. They can even have an outside appeal. We put in `binding decision' on the outside appeal. The decisions would be binding. The plan would have to pay if someone said, `Wait a minute. We thought we were waiting for coverage and we didn't get it.' They would have an internal appeal and an external appeal 
and that applies to every single employer-sponsored plan in America. We have heard different numbers. It is about 125 million Americans who would be covered under those plans--every single one--unlike my colleagues' plan; I looked at his. I just want to say that it is the right to sue for more. Under the Democrat bill, their idea is that we are going to get more health care by having more suits. We are going to sue people. You can already sue a health care plan to get a covered service. They want to sue for more. 
In the Democrat proposal, they have 56 new causes of action where you can sue. It would be an invitation for litigation, to not only sue the health care plan but to sue the employer as well. I have been in the private sector, I have been an employer, a small employer--maybe a little larger; I went from a few employees to 100 employees. If you make employers liable for suits on health care plans, they will drop health care plans very quickly and you will have an increase in the number of uninsured that will be in the millions. You will also have costs. CBO estimated that the Democrat bill would increase health care costs by 4 percent over what they are already estimated to cost, at 5.2 percent. That is a 9.2 percent cost increase if we enact the Democrat bill. That would cause millions of people to lose health insurance. I don't think that is smart. 
So I want to just make sure that our colleagues are aware of the fact that we are willing to have a significant, credible debate. We are willing to consider various alternatives. We are not willing to get an unlimited amount of time. Earlier, my colleague had offered his bill on an appropriations bill. I said it didn't belong there. Maybe we should have left it there. We could have offered some substitutes. 
One way or another, we are going to take up this issue. It is our intention to take it up prior to the August break. That is the majority leader's call. We understand that we have a lot of appropriations bills to do, and that must be done. I know my colleagues on the Transportation Committee are ready to go to work. I won't delay them much longer. We will have adequate time to debate the pros and cons of this bill. 
I heard some other allegations--that they don't do anything. The Senator from Delaware said, `They have all this lip service. They provide for emergency care, gag clauses, and access, direct access to OB/GYN and pediatricians, but that doesn't do anything.' I disagree. We protect the unprotected. We don't have the philosophy that we should preempt States who are, in many cases, doing a better job than the Federal Government. There is a presumption on the Democrat side that the Federal Government can do it better than State government. Let's protect the unprotected, cover the plans that don't have protections often by the State. 
My State has 24 mandates. They have a lot of things that aren't in the Democrat plan or Republican plan, and they are doing quite well. They are considering many more. Most States are looking at the Patients' Bill of Rights, and 36 States have already enacted several others, and 45 States already have a gag clause. Maybe some people think Washington, DC, should decide what kind of communication should or should not be made by physicians, and so on. 
My point is, I think we have tried to craft a very careful, balanced, good proposal that won't escalate costs, that won't have undue mandates. The Democrat proposal has 359 mandates. Maybe instead of calling it the Kennedy bill, the Patients' Bill of Rights, they should call it the Kennedy bill of mandates, because it is this idea that the Government in Washington, DC, should dictate everything. 
So I look forward to the debate. I look forward to resolving this issue and trying to come up with a good, responsible bill that won't drive up health care costs, that won't add layers and layers of bureaucracy and regulation and red tape, that won't really deter quality health care. 
Our bill, I might mention, has a lot of things to deal with improving quality health care. I compliment Senator Collins, Senator Frist, Senator Jeffords, and others who worked to put a lot of quality provisions in this health care, whether you are dealing with women's health, or dealing with research, trying to get research out to States and rural areas that would really improve quality health care--not a Federal definition that we know best, but trying to really advance technology and get that information to patients, to various areas around the country that would actually improve the quality of health care in America today. 
I thank my colleagues who are managing this bill. I hope they will have success in moving this bill forward. I look forward to the debate and, hopefully, a debate next week on the so-called Patients' Bill of Rights.

Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, the amendment that I have offered on behalf of myself, Senator Coats, Senator Mack, Senator Allard, Senator Faircloth, and Senator Feingold, strikes the increase in the FHA guarantee that right now is--last year it was $160,000, and under present law it goes to $170,000. The committee wants to take it up to $197,000. This is a Federal guarantee, 100 percent guarantee, saying we are going to guarantee mortgages up to $197,000. 
You have to have income of $75,000 or $80,000 to be able to afford that kind of mortgage. FHA is supposed to be guaranteeing loans for people with low and moderate incomes, not high incomes. I urge my colleagues to adopt this amendment.

Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Republican Patients' Bill of Rights. Joining me in this effort are 46 of my colleagues who recognize the importance of ensuring that all Americans are able to not only receive the care they have been promised, but also receive the highest quality of care available. The foundation of this proposal was to address some of the very real concerns that consumers have about their health care needs. 
We know that many Americans have believed they were denied coverage that their plans were supposed to cover. We recognize that some individuals fear that their health care plans will not give them access to specialists when they need them. We know that some Americans think their health care plans care more about cost than they do about quality. 
In contrast, we also know that many Americans are happy and satisfied with their health care plan. We know that 81 percent of managed care enrollees are satisfied with their current health care plan. Another recent analysis suggest that 79 percent of consumers in HMOs would recommend their coverage. In addition Americans are leery of Washington solutions and increased federal intervention. 
Last January, the Leader asked me to put together a group of colleagues to address the issue of health care quality. For the past seven months, Senators Frist, Collins, Hagel, Roth, Jeffords, Coats, Santorum, and Gramm worked tirelessly to put together a responsible, credible package that would preserve what is best about our Nation's health care while at the same time determine ways to improve upon--without stifling--the quality of care our nation delivers. We set out to rationally examine the issues and develop reasonable solutions without injuring patient access to affordable, high quality care. 
This was no easy task. We spent month after month talking to experts who understand the difficulty and complexity of our system. We met with representatives from all aspects of the industry including the Mayo Clinic, the Henry Ford Health Systems, the American Medical Association, the American Hospital Association, the National Committee for Quality Assurance, the Joint Commission on the Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations, Corporate Medical Directors, Commissioners from the President's Quality Commission, Purchasers, Families USA, the Employee Benefit Research Institute and many others. 
After many, many months of dissecting serious questions about our system we determined that there were indeed some areas in which we could improve patient access and quality. 
We have put together an innovative plan that will answer the problems that exist in the industry while at the same time preserving affordability, which is of utmost importance. Mr. President, I think you agree that if someone loses their health insurance because a politician playing doctor drives prices to an unaffordable level, you have hardly given them more rights or better quality health care. 
We are proud of what we have been able to accomplish. For the first time, patients can choose to be unencumbered in their relationship with their doctor. They will be able to choose their own doctor and get the middle man out of the way. There will be no corporate bureaucrat, no government bureaucrat and no lawyer standing between a patient and their doctor. 
Mr. President, the bill we introduce today: 
Protects consumers in employer-sponsored plans that are exempt from state regulation. People enrolled in such plans will have the right to: 
Choose their doctors. Our bill contains both `point-of-service' and `continuity of care' requirements that will enhance consumer choice. 
See their ob-gyns and pediatricians without referral. Our bill will give patients direct access to pediatricians and ob-gyns without prior referral from a `gatekeeper.' 
Have a `prudent layperson' standard applied to their claims for emergency care. The GOP alternative will require health plans to cover--without prior authorization--emergency care that a `prudent layperson' would consider medically necessary. 
Communicate openly with their doctors without `gag' clauses. 
Holds health plans accountable for their decisions. 
Extends to enrollees in ERISA health plans and their doctors the right to appeal adverse coverage decisions to a physician who was not involved in the initial coverage determination. 
Allows enrollees to appeal adverse coverage determinations to independent medical experts who have no affiliation with the health plan. Determinations by these experts will be binding on the health plan. 
Requires health plans to disclose to enrollees consumer information, including what's covered, what's not, how much they'll have to pay in deductibles and coinsurance, and how to appeal adverse coverage decisions to independent medical experts. 
Guarantees consumers access to their medical records. 
Requires health care providers, health plans, employers, health and life insurers, and schools and universities to permit an individual to inspect, copy and amend his or her own medical information. 
Requires health care providers, health plans, health oversight agencies, public health authorities, employers, health and life insurers, health researchers, law enforcement officials, and schools and universities to establish appropriate safeguards to protect the confidentiality, security, accuracy and integrity of protected health information and notify 
enrollees of these safeguards. 
Protects patients from genetic discrimination in health insurance. Prohibits health plans from collecting or using predictive genetic information about a patient to deny health insurance coverage or set premium rates. 
Promotes quality improvement by supporting research to give patients and physicians better information regarding quality. 
Establishes the Agency for Healthcare Quality Research (AHQR), whose purpose is to foster overall improvement in healthcare quality and bridge the gap between what we know and what we do in healthcare today. The Agency is built on the platform of the current Agency for Health Care Policy and Research, but is refocused and enhanced to become the hub and driving force of federal efforts to improve the quality of healthcare in all practice environments--not just managed care. 
The role of the Agency is not to mandate a national definition of quality, but to support the science necessary to provide information to patients regarding the quality of the care they receive, to allow physicians to compare their quality outcomes with their peers, and to enable employers and individuals to be prudent purchasers based on quality. 
Supports research, screening, treatment, education, and data collection activities to improve the health of women. 
Promotes basic and clinical research for osteoporosis; breast and ovarian cancer; and aging processes regarding women. 
Expands research efforts into the underlying causes and prevention of cardiovascular diseases in women--the leading cause of death among American women. 
Supports data collection through the National Center for Health Statistics and the National Program of Cancer Registries, which are the leading sources of national data on the health status of women in the U.S. 
Supports the National Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection Program, which provides for regular screening for breast and cervical cancers to underserved women. 
Requires that the length of hospital stay after a mastectomy, lumpectomy or lymph node dissection be determined only by the physician, in consultation with the patient, and without the need to obtain authorization from the health plan. If a plan covers mastectomies, it also must cover breast reconstruction after a mastectomy. 
Makes health insurance more accessible and affordable by: 
Allowing self-employed people to deduct the full amount of their health care premiums. 
Making medical savings accounts available to everyone. 
Reforming cafeteria plans to let consumers save for future health care costs. 
Mr. President, this bill is a comprehensive bill of rights that will benefit all Americans, and I am proud to join with so many of my colleagues in introducing it. 
Mr. President, I want to take a moment to address some criticisms that have been made of our bill. These criticisms highlight some significant differences between our bill and the health care bill introduced by Senate Democrats. Mr. President, our bill does differ significantly from the Senate Democrats' bill. 
Our bill is the `Patients' Bill of Rights.' Theirs is the `Lawyers' Right to Bill.' 
Our bill lets doctors decide whether care is medically necessary. Theirs lets lawyers decide. 
Our bill empowers an independent medical expert to order an insurance company to pay for medically necessary care so that patients suffer no harm. Theirs allows trial lawyers to sue health plans after harm is done. 
Mr. President, when my insurance company tells me that they won't cover a service for my family, I want the ability to appeal that decision to a doctor who doesn't work for my insurance company. And I want that appeal handled promptly, so that my family receives the benefit. That is what our bill requires. 
The Democrats' bill creates new ways for trial lawyers to make money. According to a June 1998 study by Multinational Business Services, the Democrats' bill would create 56 new Federal causes of action--56 new reasons to sue people in Federal court. 
That's fine for trial lawyers, but it doesn't do much for patients. Patients want their claim disputes handled promptly and fairly. According to a study by the General Accounting Office, it takes an average of 25 months--more than two years--to resolve a malpractice suit. One cause that the GAO studied took 11 years to resolve! I'm sure the lawyers who handled that case did quite well for themselves. But what about the patient? 
Under our bill, patients can appeal directly to an outside medical expert for a prompt review of their claim--without having to incur any legal expenses. In medical malpractice litigation, patients receive an average of only 43 cents of every dollar awarded. The rest goes to lawyers and court fees. 
Our bill assures that health care dollars are used to serve patients. Their bill diverts these dollars away from patients and into the pockets of trial lawyers. 
Another big difference between our bill and the one introduced by Senate Democrats is that their bill takes a `big government' approach to health reform. 
Mr. President, it was just four years ago that we debated Clintoncare on the Senate floor. President Clinton wanted government-run health care for all Americans. He wanted it then; he wants it still. 
Just last September, President Clinton told the Service Employees Union that he was `glad' that he had pushed for the federal government to take over health care. `Now if what I tried to do before won't work,' the President said, `maybe we can do it another way. A step at a time until we eventually finish this.' 
The Democrats' bill would take us a step closer to the President's dream of a health care system run by federal bureaucrats and trial lawyers. The study I cited earlier by Multinational Business Services found that their bill would impose 359 new federal mandates, 59 new sets of Federal regulations, and require the government to hire 3,828 new federal bureaucrats. 
Our bill relies on State Insurance Commissioners to protect those Americans who are enrolled in state-regulated plans. We protect the unprotected by providing new federal safeguards to the 48 million Americans who are enrolled in plans that the states are not permitted to regulate. 
Their bill imposes a risky and complicated scheme that relies on federal bureaucrats at the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) to enforce patients' rights in states that do not conform to the federal mandates in their bill. 
HCFA is the agency that oversees the federal Medicare and Medicaid programs. Last year, in the Balanced Budget Act, Congress created new consumer protections for Medicare beneficiaries--a `Patients' Bill of Rights' for the 38.5 million senior citizens and disabled Americans who rely on Medicare for their health care. 
We asked HCFA to protect those rights. How have they done? I regret to say, Mr. President, that they have not done very well at all. 
On July 16, a GAO witness testified before the Ways and Means Committee on how well HCFA was doing in enforcing the Medicare patients' bill of rights. According to GAO, HCFA has `missed 25 percent of the implementation deadlines, including the quality-of-care medical review process for skilled nursing facilities. It is clear that HCFA will continue to miss implementation deadlines as it attempts to balance the resource demands generated by the Balanced Budget Act with other competing objectives.' 
Mr. President, I won't detail all of the ways that HCFA has failed--the fact that it is delaying implementation of a prostate screening program to which Medicare beneficiaries are entitled, the fact that it has failed to establish a quality-of-care medical review process for skilled nursing facilities, the fact that it is far behind schedule in developing a new payment system for home health services. The list goes on and on. 
But let me focus on one failure that is especially relevant. All of us agree that people have the right to information about their health plans. When they have the choice of more than one plan, accurate information that compares the plans is critical. 
Last year, Congress allocated $95 million to HCFA to develop an information and education program for Medicare beneficiaries. This money was to be used for publishing and mailing handbooks containing comparative plan information to seniors, establishing a toll-free number and Internet website, and sponsoring health information fairs. 
Well, there haven't been any information fairs and the toll-free number isn't operational. They do have a website, but they've decided to mail comparative information handbooks only to seniors in 5 states: Washington, Oregon, Ohio, Florida and Arizona. So for the princely sum of a $95 million, only about 5.5 million seniors will receive important information about their health plans, leaving 32.5 million seniors without these handbooks. At that rate, HCFA would need more than $1 billion each year just for handbooks. 
Mr. President, if this agency is struggling to protest the rights of 38.5 million Medicare beneficiaries, how can we ask it to protect the rights of up as many as 100 million people enrolled in private health plans? 
We believe that consumer protections are too important to entrust to a cumbersome and inefficient federal government. State governments have long been in the business of insurance regulation and the federal government should not usurp their role. 
The federal government should protect those who are enrolled in plans that are exempt from state regulation and those enrolled in the programs it runs, like Medicare and Medicaid. The federal government should start protecting the rights of senior citizens under Medicare, instead of meddling in areas where it doesn't belong. 
Mr. President, our bill is a truly comprehensive bill of rights for patients, providing new consumer protections for the 48 million Americans who are unprotected by state law, giving the 124 million Americans enrolled in employer-sponsored plans new rights to appeal adverse coverage decisions, protecting the civil rights of consumers to gain access to their medical records, protecting consumers against discrimination based on genetic tests, promoting quality improvement, establishing a new women's health initiative, and giving millions of Americans access to affordable health insurance through medical savings accounts. 
The doctor-patient relationship is one of the most important in people's lives. Our legislation preserves and protects that relationship, while taking many common-sense steps forward to affirm and expand quality and access. I look forward with my colleagues and many cosponsors, to the floor debate on this vital issue.

Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I yield myself 2 minutes. 
I urge my colleagues to vote `no' on this amendment. We have debated this issue before, but I will make a couple comments because maybe some of my colleagues are not aware of what this amendment has. 
This amendment has $150 million of a new tax, and unlike any other tax that we passed that I am aware of, this allows the Secretary of Health and Human Services to conduct a survey. And from that survey, she is going to raise--she being Secretary Shalala at this point--is going to raise $150 million. 
I find that incredible. If the Senator wants to raise the cigarette tax, raise the cigarette tax; say we are going to have an excise of so many cents per pack, and that is fine, that is legitimate. But to say we are going to have a survey that basically is going to be deemed to be accurate and give the Secretary of Health and Human Services the power and authority to raise that tax is absurd. It is terrible tax policy. 
Then it is to enforce, what? The FDA regs. The FDA regs, some people are acting like they are sacrosanct, like they are good. FDA regs dealing with ID check, which I heard my colleague bragging about, have the Federal Government involved in enforcing ID checks up to age 27. 
It is illegal to smoke up to age 18, but we are going to have the Federal Government setting up an enforcement mechanism to find out if people 26 years old are buying cigarettes. And if they don't check an ID--if you have a convenience store or something and you don't ask what their age is when they are 26 years old, you are in violation of the regulation, and you can be fined up to $10,000. That is the FDA reg that he is wanting to give FDA more power to enforce. 
Do we really want to give the Federal Government enforcement powers to be checking the IDs of young adults up to age 26, and if you do not comply, you can be fined up to $10,000? I think that is absurd. Equally as bad is to give the Secretary of Health and Human Services taxing authority, to be able to raise $150 million. 
I think they are two of the worst pieces of policy I have seen. We have debated tobacco at length. I am willing to do some things to discourage tobacco consumption. All this would do would be to encourage bureaucracy at FDA. I urge my colleagues to support the point of order by the Senator from New Mexico. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, before I describe the amendment, first I would like to just express my appreciation to my colleagues, Senator Bond from Missouri and Senator Mikulski from Maryland. I have the pleasure of serving with them on the Appropriations Committee, on this subcommittee, and I enjoyed the work on this subcommittee. This subcommittee is a hard committee because it deals with so many agencies. It is not easy. It is not just one agency. The bill is commonly VA-HUD and other agencies. It includes EPA, the Science Foundation, NASA and so on. So it requires an enormous amount of work by staff and by Senators to try to stay on top of all the demands, and the multitude of requests by the agencies and Senators who are involved with them. So I compliment them for their work. 
Mr. President, I agree with most of the things they have in their bill, although I have some questions about the cost of the bill, but I will may raise that at another time. I notice in the committee report the bill has about a $5 billion increase in requests compared to last year. I do not know of any other appropriations bill that has that kind of increase. I am going to have to check into that, but that is not what I raise tonight. I may vote against the bill because of the $5 billion compared to last year's level. I am concerned about that, but I am going to do my homework on that. 
The reason I am rising to introduce this amendment is because in the committee bill it increases the FHA loan limits and increases them rather significantly. For those who are not familiar with this, FHA, the Federal Housing Administration, insures mortgage loans. These mortgages are 100 percent guaranteed by the Federal Government. It was started many, many years ago, and its purpose was to expand housing in areas where people maybe could not afford it. It had a noble purpose. We had a housing shortage. We had people who could not get money, could not borrow money. The private sector markets were not there and money was not available to assist people to buy a home. 
One of the basic, fundamental principles we have in this country is we want people to be able to buy their own homes. We want people to be able to own their own homes, not just rent, we want people to own their own homes. So the Federal Government assisted in this program with the Federal Housing Administration. 
But we have limits. We have guiding principles that say, if we are going to have the Federal Government insure home loans to individuals, they basically be limited to about 95 percent of the median home price for that area. It kind of makes sense. You should not be able to get 100 percent Federal insurance for home loans far in excess of the value of homes in the area. That does not make sense. 
There is in effect, base amounts or a bottom amount so every county across the country would not fall below a particular amount. And then there is also a cap. We ought to have some kind of limit. We should not have the Federal Government insuring loans very expensive homes. I see my colleague from Rhode Island. There are some areas of Rhode Island, at least one area there, where there are probably all million-dollar homes.

<DOCNO>105-nickles-ok-4-19980716</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
Mr. NICKLES. Maybe that is in Massachusetts, I am not sure. But the Federal Government should not be insuring those million dollar homes. So we have a maximum limit to make sure the federal government doesn't insure million dollar homes. The bottom loan limit is $86,000 this year. Last year, it was $81,000, so it has increased. The top limit it is $170,000. So you have limits set at 95 percent of the median value of homes, but everywhere in this country is going to have at least this base limit, $86,000. Right now, current law, you can get a home Loan, insured 100 percent by the Federal Government, guaranteed by the taxpayers, in an amount equal to $86,000. In some areas, the higher price home areas, up to $170,000. 
The committee increased both of those limits. They increased the base amount from $86,000 to $109,000. And they also increased the top limit from $170,000 to $197,000--almost $200,000. Our amendment strikes the increase in the top limit. 
I hope my colleagues would say, wait a minute, $170,000 is enough for the Federal Government to insure. Shall we really go up to $200,000? Last year, it was $160,000, so, because it is tied to a percentage of the Freddie Mac conforming loan limit, it already goes up from last year's level in the top areas, from $160,000 it goes to $170,000. Isn't that enough? But, no, the committee said let's go on up to almost $200,000. 
The purpose of this program was to assist low-income people, or people who could not get loans to be able to get a loan with a Federal guarantee; a loan that is guaranteed by taxpayers 100 percent. But now the committee is going all the way up to $200,000? I think that is too high. I do not think that was the purpose of the program. 
The Secretary of Housing called me two or three times and said, `Can't we do this?' I disagreed with him. He wanted to do it on the highway bill, and I respect the Secretary of Housing, but I said, `No. That is bad public policy.' They tried to get this put in the highway bill and I disagreed with him and we were successful in stopping it. Now the VA-HUD appropriations subcommittee is doing it. 
Our amendment does not touch the bottom increase. I might tell my colleagues, I think we should. I did not want to increase the bottom amount, but I also know how to count votes. I didn't have the votes to prevent the increase in the bottom limit. I hope we will have the votes to not increase the top limit. I hope we will keep the Federal Housing Administration targeted to lower income individuals. You have to have a pretty good income in order to be able to afford a $200,000 mortgage. Is that the purpose of the Federal Government, to insure loans and mortgages up to $200,000? I don't think so. I don't think that is why FHA was created. 
What brought us here? The Secretary of Housing wants to increase the loan limits. I guess there was a Housing Affairs letter, an internal industry newsletter that quoted a HUD official saying, `The increase in the loan limit is vital to the President's nationwide home ownership campaign, and if it passes Congress, it will surely translate into votes in the next Presidential campaign.' 
I'm not sure that is why we have this increase. I just don't think that is what the Federal Government should be doing. I might mention the administration wanted to take it up to $227,000, so maybe I should thank my colleagues from Maryland and Missouri because they did not go to $227,000. They did not accede to the President's request. The President wanted to take it to $227,000 nationwide. That is a quarter of a million dollars. That was the administration's proposal. To me, that is absolutely wrong and we should not do that. 
What kind of a job has FHA been doing? Have they done such a great job that we should be encouraging them to make more and more loans? I might mention, when you are having a Federal insured loan, you are crowding out private sector loans. Shouldn't the private sector be making loans? If we are talking about loans of $200,000, shouldn't the private sector be making those loans with the risk that is involved? Or are we going to have the Federal Government do it and have the taxpayers at risk? I think the private sector should do it. If somebody wants to build or buy a $200,000 home, great, I hope they do. But I don't think the taxpayers should be at risk for it. 
I have a young son who is working. When he looks at his paycheck he says, `Hey, Dad, thank you very much. You guys are taking a big chunk out of my check. Thank you very much.' I don't think we should put his tax dollars at risk for somebody having a $200,000 home. He doesn't have one. My daughter doesn't have one. Why in the world should we be putting them at risk to be guaranteeing $200,000 loans? I don't think we should be doing that. But we are getting ready to do it in this bill. So I think that is a serious mistake. 
Is FHA doing such a great job? They have three times the default rate of conventional loans. They are not doing that great if they have a default rate running at 8.4 percent, three times the national rate in conventional loans. 
They have a smaller downpayment, which means a much greater risk. If you have a loan with FHA, I believe the loan-to-value ratio is 96 percent. That is far lower than conventional loans, so you have a lot more risk and three times the default rate. 
FHA is not doing such a great job. We have a system that really encourages lenders to make FHA-insured loans, and that is another part of our amendment. We try to take some of the incentive away from lenders steering home buyers into FHA. Right now the system is really loaded, really geared towards FHA. You get a 100 percent Federal guarantee if you go FHA, and if you happen to be in the business of lending, you are going to get a much better deal going through FHA than you do through the private sector. 
In our amendment, we also change the point level dealing with Ginnie Mae. We raise the Ginnie Mae guaranty fee from 6 basis points to 12. I might mention, under most conventional loans, servicing fees to lenders are usually about half, about 25 points, but under current law, FHA, it is 44 points. 
What does that mean? If you are servicing a $100,000 loan, under a conventional mortgage you will get about half of those 50 basis points, or $250 on a $100,000 mortgage. If you do it for FHA, you get $440, a much better deal if you go with the Government-guaranteed loan. There is a much lower downpayment, and the Federal Government is going to guarantee it 100 percent. There is a real encouragement for people to steer home buyers into FHA. The Government is going to take care of it. 
I might mention, that has had a catastrophic effect in many, many neighborhoods. This is sad.

Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I have a letter from Jack Kemp, who was former Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, dated July 15, 1998. I will read one short paragraph. He says: 
Your amendment will also stop a brash move by the administration to push the FHA further and further away from its core mission of supporting the home ownership dreams of low- and moderate-income American families, a noble mission that has enjoyed bipartisan support in Congress. 
The drive to raise the FHA loan limit to $197,000 is motivated by a desire for votes in the fall elections. It would take an income of about $75,000 a year to qualify for such a loan, or the top 16% of wage earners.

Mr. NICKLES. Let me just conclude by stating that I regret coming in and opposing my friends and colleagues from Missouri and Maryland on this issue. But if my memory serves, several years ago the Senator from Maryland and I wrestled with this issue on the floor of the Senate. 
At that time there was an effort for people to raise the limits. I said, `Wait a minute. Why are we having the Federal Government guaranteeing more and more loans?' Home ownership, I might mention, in this country is at an all-time high. I think that is great. Most of that is done in the private sector. It just so happens FHA is losing its percentage share as the private sector has exploded. I think that is good. 
I think this increase is an effort by the Secretary of Housing to say, `Wait a minute. We want the Federal Government to be making more loans.' I also think it is also driven by a desire to generate more money for the Government. Because as you increase the loan limits, you increase the fees, and so on, and that allows the Government to spend more money. 
I will not get too technical on the budget, but if the committee raises money through fees and so on, that allows them to stay within the `budget caps' because they get an offset for the increase in fees, and as a result, by increasing the fees both on the bottom and the top, the committee is going to get about an extra $80 million a year over and above the budget that we agreed to last year, that the President signed. I am not saying it is not within the rules of the Congress. I am just saying I think it is an attempt to have more money to spend. I personally am somewhat troubled by that. 
Under existing law, loan rates on both the low end and the top end have already increased. They increased on the low end from $81,000 to $86,000. This committee bill increases it to $109,000. We do not touch that. I think maybe we should, but we do not. 
Our amendment just says we should not increase the top limit from $170,000--keep in mind, last year's was $160,000--to $197,000. A $10,000 increase in Federal Government loan guarantees in the high income areas, surely that is enough. The committee wants to take it almost $200,000. I think that is a serious mistake. I think that takes FHA away from its core mission. FHA's mission was to help low- and moderate-income people, not the wealthiest 15 percent of society. 
I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of this amendment. We will be voting on it early tomorrow morning. I think it is very important that we protect taxpayers from greater risk, and that we keep FHA focused on low and moderate income home buyers. I thank my colleague from Wisconsin for his leadership and support on this amendment, his coauthorship of this amendment, as well as my colleague, Senator Mack, from Florida, who happens to be chairman of the authorizing committee. I also want to thank Senators Faircloth, Allard, and Feingold for their support in trying to eliminate this expansion of the higher income limits for FHA. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. NICKLES. I thank my friend from Missouri for allowing me to ask him a question regarding the Supreme Court's June 25th ruling that the line-item veto is unconstitutional. As Chairman of the VA/HUD Appropriations Subcommittee, I believe his opinion on this matter is important. Especially, in light of the fact that his Subcommittee has approved $900,000 in its FY 1998 Conference Report for the final planning and design stages of a new national veterans cemetery in Oklahoma which was line-item vetoed by the president. 
My question is this, now that the line-item veto has been declared unconstitutional, does the VA now have the authority to spend the $900,000 that was appropriated in the FY 1998 VA/HUD bill.

Mr. NICKLES. I thank the Chairman. I want to add that my staff asked the Congressional Research Service (CRS) this same question and in a memo to my staff CRS offered this opinion, `The United States Supreme Court has held that a law that is repugnant to the Constitution is void and is as no law.' Seeing as the line-item veto has been declared unconstitutional, it is void and is as no law. Therefore one can conclude that the $900,000 set aside for the cemetery in Oklahoma should be spent by the VA for that purpose.

Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, the Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma has brought to my attention concerns relating to the Food Distribution Program for Indian Reservation (FDPIR) program administered by the Department of Agriculture. Specifically, USDA regulations prohibit Oklahoma Indian tribes distributing commodity goods under FDPIR to tribal members in population area that exceed 10,000 persons. I have been made aware this prohibition does not exist in other states. As a result, Oklahoma tribes are placed in a different category from tribes administering FDPIR commodity programs. 
To address the concerns raised by the Choctaw Nation, I would request the Secretary of Agriculture, in consultation with the appropriate Oklahoma state agencies, review the current regulations with respect to the FDPIR program in Oklahoma and take any necessary regulatory action to ensure tribal members receive adequate commodity services from the most appropriate provider.

Mr. NICKLES. I will respond to a couple of comments made by my colleague and friend from Massachusetts. 
One, he is absolutely, totally, completely wrong on many of the statements that he made, particularly in saying the Republican leadership wouldn't allow this bill to come to the floor, allow a debate to happen on the floor of the Senate on health care. As the Senator should be aware, we have already made a couple of offers that we would try to accommodate some type of time agreement to bring up this issue this month. We 
are still working on it. 
My colleague was absolutely incorrect when he said the Republicans were insisting that, if we win, we can still put this bill back on the calendar. That wasn't our request. That wasn't our statement. It is not our last request. 
I am reading the unanimous consent request given on June 25 or 26 which said votes held on final passage--if read the third time, the Senate votes on passage of the bill without any intervening action or debate. The Senate will request a conference with the House, the chair will be authorized to appoint conferees, and the Senate-House care bill will be placed on the calendar. 
I make those points. We are willing to have debate on the bill. We are willing to consider different options--both the House and the Senate, the proposal by my friend and colleague from Massachusetts, as well as the substitute that I am working on with some of our other colleagues. 
We will have a debate on the floor. We are willing to work out a time agreement to where we will have it this month. We don't intend to spend 2 months on this bill or even 1 month on this bill, but we are willing to have a debate on health care legislation. It goes under the title of Patients' Bill of Rights. I happen to think that is a very good title. 
I might also mention that the President's Commission on Health Care Quality came up with a lot of recommendations. They have several things that they recommend be included in all health care plans, but they said they should be included voluntarily. I might mention that the bill that our colleague from Massachusetts is promoting mandates; it doesn't have voluntary compliance. It mandates a lot of things that aren't included in the President's Commission--many things. And many of those things have a lot of cost. We have asked the Congressional Budget Office to give us cost estimates of Senator Kennedy's bill, the Patients' Bill of Rights, and we don't have that. I hope we can get it before we commence debate. 
We have stated, and I just want to repeat to all of our colleagues, we are willing to discuss this issue. We are willing to have time on the Democrats' alternative. I might mention, the Democrats' alternative, I believe, to my knowledge, no Republican in the Senate has cosponsored, nor should they, because I think it is a bad bill. I think it definitely would increase consumer cost, drive up the cost of health care insurance, the cost of health care, period, and the net result would be, fewer people would have health care. I don't think that is a result that we want to have. I am willing to say that I am willing to work to try to come up with a package that we can support. 
I see my friend and colleague from Florida. Maybe we can come up with a bipartisan package. I am willing to do that. I know the Senator from Florida has met with other Senators in a bipartisan way to see if we can come up with items that will make sense, that will not have dramatic increases in consumer cost, in health care cost, but try to see if we can't work out some things to help cover some of the problems that have arisen with managed care. I am willing to do that. I am not one who says we don't need any legislation whatever. Some people have taken that position. That is not this Senator's position. I am willing to try to legislate responsibly in health care. I don't want to do something we will find out will do damage, like how significant health care cost increases affect our consumers. I don't think they are asking for increased health care costs. I don't think that would be helpful. 
So I will repeat to my colleague from Massachusetts and other Senators on the floor--and I know, because I have talked to the majority leader day in and day out--we are working on trying to come up with an arrangement where we will have adequate time, but not an unlimited amount of time, to consider health care legislation--maybe under the guise of the Patients' Bill of Rights--and to allow a couple different alternatives. My colleague from Massachusetts has an alternative; he has a proposal. Some of us are working on a different proposal. There may be some of those things in common. But certainly there will be very significant differences--big differences, philosophically, in cost, in premium increases, and so we need to discuss those. 
We need to have an adequate time to discuss those and to consider the different alternatives and then to have a vote. We expect to do so. We don't expect to change the rules of the Senate. We don't expect to guarantee that one side or the other side will have a victory in the process, but we have stated--and, again, as assistant majority leader, I am telling our colleagues on the Democrat side of the aisle that we are willing to try to work out an arrangement, and we will have adequate time to discuss this issue on the floor this month. I think that is fair enough. 
The majority leader has been fair. What we are not willing to do is stop the Senate from doing any work. So, yes, we are going to pass IRS reform and we are going to pass it tomorrow. I think it is a giant step in the right direction. Yes, we are going to take up higher education reform, and we need to do that. It is very important to colleges, universities, and students all across the country. That needs to happen. Yes, we need to pass appropriations bills. I think it was very unfortunate that the minority leader of the Senate introduced the Patients' Bill of Rights on the VA-HUD bill, the veterans and housing appropriations bill. It doesn't belong there. He knows that. We have already indicated a willingness and a commitment to bring up the so-called Patients' Bill of Rights this month. Someone might say, wait a minute, you have not passed the tobacco bill. We spent 4 weeks on the tobacco bill. They didn't win. I believe they are not going to win on the Patients' Bill of Rights. 
Senator Kennedy said, `We are going to bring up minimum wage.' They have that right. But they don't have a right to have their agenda totally dominate the Senate. The Senate needs to do its work. We will consider some of their issues and some of ours, like IRS reform. We are going to take that up, and, hopefully, we will pass that tomorrow. 
So I mention to all of our colleagues that I want them to be aware of the fact that we are trying to be fair, we will be fair, and we will consider this issue. We will have different alternatives--I think significantly different alternatives. I believe the alternative that the Republicans will be offering will be in stark contrast to the Democrats'. Maybe some things will be in common. We are going to offer greater choice and opportunity and competition. Hopefully, that will help change buyer behavior and get health care costs down, instead of the increases that would be achieved by Senator Kennedy's proposal. 
So there will be differences. But that is fine, that is good, that is legitimate. We will have that debate, and we will have adequate time for that. But it can't consume 2 months. It will probably consume 2 or 3 days. The Senate needs to decide 
what it wants to do. I expect that we will. 
So I make that commitment to our colleagues. This is going to be a busy month. We need to pass a lot of appropriations bills. We have a couple appropriations bills we are working on right now that, unfortunately, people have tried to load up with bills that are extraneous, like the tobacco amendment on the agriculture appropriations bill or the Patients' Bill of Rights on the VA-HUD bill. That is not acceptable. It is not going anywhere. It may be good for political posturing, but it is not going to help pass their legislation. We have committed to bring up the legislation in due time this month, have adequate debate and consideration of a couple of different alternatives, and go from there. So I make that commitment to our colleagues. I think we should lower the rhetoric and the volume it has had and see if we can't work together in a bipartisan way to make some positive improvements in health care legislation. 
Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Florida. I know he had a unanimous consent request to speak. I didn't mean to delay him. I apologize for interjecting, but I did think it was important to respond to the Senator from Massachusetts for his comments. I appreciate the accommodation. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I compliment my colleague. I am disappointed in the minority leader's statement, and also its tone. A lot of us came back from the one-week break for the Fourth of July and said we have work to do, we have appropriations bills to pass, we have product liability reform bill to pass, we have the IRS reform bill. And then somebody says this is an unbelievable procedure. No, it is not. We are moving to a conference report. That has priority under the rules of the Senate. We are moving to a conference report on a bill that already passed the House and the Senate, and, hopefully, the President will sign it. I think it may be one of the most notable and significant achievements of this Congress. 
Then our colleagues say, wait a minute, you are denying us an opportunity to offer an amendment. I disagree. The Senator from Arkansas had an amendment on the space station that lasted most of the afternoon. We were clearly willing to take amendments. We had an amendment that Senator Kohl from Wisconsin and I were going to offer dealing with FHA. That was bipartisan. We were trying to do the Senate's work. As a matter of fact, the Senate was planning on staying on the VA appropriations bill so we could finish tonight, tomorrow, or the next day, to do our work. The minority leader tried to place an amendment--or did file an amendment called the Patients' Bill of Rights on the appropriations bill. He has a right to do so, but he knows it is not the time or place to do it. 
For the information of our colleagues and the viewing public, the majority leader has already said we will take up the so-called issue dealing with health care and the regulation of managed care, with the very nice title of `The Patients' Bill of Rights.' We will take it up this month. But in the meantime, let's finish our work, let's pass the IRS reform bill, let's pass appropriations bills. 
We are willing to have a decent amount of time on the so-called Patients' Bill of Rights this month and to consider alternatives. The Senator from Massachusetts has an alternative. I am working on an alternative. I may have a couple of other ideas. And we are willing to consider relevant amendments. I think it is a mistake to do it all month. Maybe some want to. Maybe they think there is political fodder to be gained. Some of us know we have some work to do. That is our intention. 
The majority leader made it clear that we have work to do. We are going to be voting on Mondays and Fridays. We should be passing bills. We have only passed 2 appropriations bills; we have 13 to do. The House passed five, and next week they will probably pass another five. We are, in the meantime, hoping to get two bills done this week. Unfortunately, instead, the minority said we need to put the Patients' Bill of Rights on one and then the smoking bill--even though we have spent 4 weeks on the tobacco bill. Maybe if they came up with a better alternative, we could pass a bill. But they came up with one that would cost hundreds of billions of dollars, and I think we rightfully rejected it. 
They said, `We don't have an opportunity to debate our issues.' They had 4 weeks on the so-called tobacco bill. 
Campaign finance reform has been in the Senate on numerous occasions, including this Congress. We insisted on having one amendment that said campaign contributions would be voluntary. Most of our colleagues on the Democrat side said, `No, no, we can't have voluntary campaign contributions. That would be unheard of. We can't have that kind of reform.' 
One of our colleagues said that the Senate can't work this way. Really, what they are trying to say is, `We want to have product liability reform on the floor, and we want to dump our entire Democrat agenda on,' half of which they tried and could not get passed previously. They want to dump it on this bill or on the appropriations bills, and they will keep trying until maybe something will stick. 
And then they said, `Wait a minute, if you file cloture'--cloture, for the information of people not aware of the Senate rules, it would eliminate a lot of extraneous amendments. They are acting like that hasn't happened before. George Mitchell, as majority leader, was the instigator of the quick-draw cloture motion. He would file cloture so fast, it would make your head spin. He did it time and time again. I don't like cloture. I think it happens to be too restrictive. 
The Senator from Washington, who was managing the bill, has said we are perfectly willing to work with colleagues if they have amendments they want to discuss on product liability. We can work that up and come up with an agreement. Obviously, our colleagues on the minority side said, `No. We want to put our whole agenda on. We want another debate on tobacco and the Patients' Bill of Rights, and debate on schools or education'--you name it. They want to put everything on there except product liability. 
In other words, they don't really want product liability. They have that right, but we also have a right to try to get the Senate's business done. So we are going to pass the conference report on IRS reform. We are going to take that up tomorrow. Again, I hope all of my colleagues will support that. We are going to have a vote on cloture on product liability reform. If colleagues are really interested in having legitimate amendments dealing with that issue, they could make a proposal and we could probably work that out--if we keep the amendments relevant. Are we going to say you can dump your entire agenda on it? No. At least it is my hope that we don't do that. That is the reason we have cloture--to keep amendments germane, finish our work, and be done with it. 
So I am disappointed in the rhetoric and the tone that we heard tonight. I hope we will come back and say, wait a minute, we only have 4 weeks this month and a few weeks in September--all of the month of September, and maybe part of October to finish the Senate's business. We have to pass a lot of appropriations bills. I still hope we will get a budget. I hope we will pass tax relief. So we have some significant reform that needs to happen, and we need to do the work of the Senate. 
I notice my friend from Massachusetts on the floor. He has a bill called the Patients' Bill of Rights. I am perfectly willing to debate that issue. We are willing to spend some time on that issue and give colleagues a vote on the Democrat proposal, which has been recently introduced--I guess today--on the VA-HUD appropriations bill. It doesn't belong on an appropriations bill. There is a point of order. That is legislation on an appropriations bill. That is the reason we have the rule. It does not belong there. The majority leader said we will take it up sometime this month, 
and with some amendments dealing with that issue, relevant health care amendments. 
If our colleagues are just interested in rhetorical flourishes and maybe campaign issues, they can make that attempt. But that won't legislate. That won't change the law. If they are interested in changing the law, I urge them to work with us. Let's come up with an agreement where we can bring the issue up, have an adequate amount of debate on the so-called Patients' Bill of Rights, and have different alternatives considered and voted on. 
I make that point. This side is willing. We had a significant debate on tobacco. We are willing to have a debate on the so-called Patients' Bill of Rights. We have had debate on campaign reform. We have had debate on education. Now we have to finish the appropriations bills. We have to do the work of the Senate. It is going to take both sides working together to make that happen. 
I hope we will have greater cooperation exhibited in the future for the Senate to really get its work done in a timely, efficient, and productive manner. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Electric Consumer Choice Act. For the last two years hearings and workshops have been held in both the House and Senate examining the issue of restructuring the electric industry. Many bills have been introduced on this issue by both Congressmen and Senators, some comprehensive and some dealing with more discreet issues such as repeal of the Public Utility Holding Company (PUHCA) or repeal of the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978 (PURPA). The bill that I am introducing today cuts to the heart of the issue: do we or don't we support allowing consumers to choose their electric supplier? Do we or don't we support a national competitive market in electricity? I believe the answer to these questions is a resounding `yes'! This Congress believes competition is good, that free markets work and that every American will benefit from a competitive electric industry. 
The Electric Consumer Choice Act is intended to begin the process of achieving a national, competitive electricity market. It will establish consumer choice of electric suppliers as a goal this Congress firmly supports. It achieves this in a simple, straight-forward method. First, it eliminates electric monopolies by prohibiting the granting of exclusive rights to sell to electric utilities. Second, it prohibits undue discrimination against consumers purchasing electricity in interstate commerce. Third, it provides for access to local distribution facilities and finally, it allows a state to impose reciprocity requirements on out-of-state utilities. The bill also makes it clear that nothing in this act expands the authority of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) or limits the authority of a state to continue to regulate retail sales and distribution of electric energy in a manner consistent with the Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution. 
The premise of this bill is that all attributes of today's electric energy market--generation, transmission, distribution and both wholesale and retail sales--are either in or affect interstate commerce. Therefore, any State regulation of these attributes that unduly discriminates against the interstate market for electric power violates the Commerce Clause unless such State action is protected by an act of Congress. 
The Supreme Court has interpreted Part II of the Federal Power Act (FPA) as protecting State regulation of generation, local distribution, intrastate transmission and retail sales that unduly discriminates against the interstate market for electric power. The Court has reasoned that Congress, in the FPA, determined that the federal government needed only to regulate wholesale sales and interstate transmission in order to adequately protect interstate commerce in electric energy. Thus, all other aspects of the electric energy market were reserved to the States and protected from challenges under the Commerce Clause. The Electric Consumer Choice Act amends the FPA to eliminate the protection provided for State regulation that establishes, maintains, or enforces an exclusive right to sell electric energy or that unduly discriminates against any consumer who seeks to purchase electric energy in interstate commerce. 
This bill provides consumers and electric energy suppliers with the means to achieve retail choice in all States by January 1, 2002. It does not impose a federal statutory mandate on the States. It does not preempt the States' traditional jurisdiction to regulate the aspects of the electric power market in the reserved realm--generation, local distribution, intrastate transmission, or retail sales--it merely limits the scope of what the States can do in that realm. It does not expand or extend FERC jurisdiction into the aspects of traditional State authority. 
As I stated earlier, this bill is intended to provide every consumer a choice when it comes to electricity suppliers. It is intended to establish that this Congress supports national competition when it comes to the generation of electricity. It is intended to be the beginning, not the end of the process. There are many other issues that need to be addressed at the federal level to facilitate a national market for electricity. Some of these issues include repeal of PURPA and PUHCA, taxation differences between various electric providers, clarification of jurisdiction over transmission, ensuring reliability, providing for inclusion of Power Marketing Administrations and the Tennessee Valley Authority in a national market, and other issues that can only be addressed at the Federal level. These issues need to be addressed and should be addressed. But while these issues are being debated we should ensure that progress towards customer choice proceeds. 
I am proud to say that my state of Oklahoma has been in the forefront of opening up it's electricity markets to competition. Seventeen other states have also moved to open their markets. It is my hope that the Electric Consumer Choice Act will facilitate this process nationally. To that end, I am introducing this bill today.

Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to vote `no' on the cloture vote. We have already had three cloture votes. This is going to be the fourth. This is our fourth week on this legislation. If cloture is invoked, I guess we will probably spend another 2 or 3 weeks on this legislation and not 
do the work of the Senate. 
Why should we get rid of this bill for the time being? I heard one of my colleagues say that there are no new programs in this bill. That is not correct. There are lots of new programs in this bill. We don't have a current international tobacco control awareness program that gets $350 million a year for the next 5 years, and then `as such sums as are necessary.' That is in this bill. We presently don't have a tobacco farmer quota payment of $1.6 billion per year that is going to make some tobacco farmers multimillionaires. That is not current law. It would be if this bill became law. We don't have a situation right now that gives advantages to one cigarette company over another one. Under this bill, some companies have an increase in price of at least $1.10. Some have zero. Some we increase the price of smokeless tobacco by 80-some cents; others, only 50-some cents. That is in this bill. 
There are lots of reasons to be against this bill. This bill prohibits smoking in buildings that are engaged in international traffic and international trade--far greater than any restriction on any Federal building. This bill goes way too far. If we vote cloture----

Mr. NICKLES. If we invoke cloture, we will not have the ability for a substitute. Senator Hatch has a substitute with Senator Feinstein. It will not be offered. The Gramm amendment won't be offered and couldn't be offered. 
So I urge my colleagues to vote `no' on cloture. If we have a point of order, every dime of this bill is above the budget, the budget the President agreed to with bipartisan Members of Congress last year. Clearly, a budget point of order should be sustained. This bill is above the budget. It breaks the budget. It is a violation of the budget agreement which the President agreed to with Members of Congress. 
I urge my colleagues to vote `no' on cloture and then to sustain the budget point of order. 
I thank my colleagues.

Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, the question is really, Do we have a budget or not? This bill says the budget does not apply. Read page 181. It says, `the amount of * * * appropriations shall not be included in the estimates required under section 251 of [the Budget Act]. In other words, all these hundreds of billions of dollars of spending are over and above the budget that we agreed to, that the President agreed to. 
This clearly breaks the budget. If we are going to have a budget, we should sustain it. This point of order is well made. And I urge my colleagues to support it and vote against the motion to waive the Budget Act.

Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to this bill. And I take offense to some of the comments that were made by some of our colleagues on the other side of the aisle who said, that anybody who wants to kill this bill is an instrument of big tobacco. 
That s simply not true. I did not support this deal when the tobacco industry and the administration and attorneys general got together and made a deal. They didn't consult this Senator. I was never in favor of the deal they were in favor of that some people have tried to promote and some people have tried to push, including, this administration. So let me just make that very clear. 
Now, I have many reasons to oppose this bill, and I am going to enumerate these. Not one of them has anything to do with the way the tobacco industry wants this Senator to vote. And so people making allegations--I wonder if that can be turned the other way around, but I am not going to do that. I do not impugn people's motives or their integrity. I think people have the right to make 
decisions on whether or not legislation is good legislation or bad. 
I spent a little bit of time studying this legislation. And everybody is entitled to their own opinion. They can brag on the legislation; they can be critical of it. I am going to be critical of it. I have read the legislation. 
First, let me just comment on a comment that the President made. It was reported in the Washington Post recently, Monday June 15. This past Monday, President Clinton said his critics contend that `this [is a] dark scheme in Washington to build some new federal bureaucracy, and it's the biggest load of hooey I ever heard in my life.' 
So President Clinton thinks that those of us who are critical of this legislation, who say this is just a big bureaucracy, that that is just a big bunch of hooey--as a matter of fact, `the biggest load of hooey I ever heard in my life.' 
I told my colleagues this is one of the worst pieces of legislation I have seen in my Senate career. The only thing I can think of that was worse was the health care legislation promoted by President and Mrs. Clinton. 
Mr. President, this chart that was put together by the Budget Committee, showing where the money was coming from, where the money goes, on Commerce I--and that was the bill that was reported out of the Commerce Committee--shows that the President was incorrect. This is a lot of new government. There are about 30 new programs, spending hundreds of billions of dollars, all above budget, all outside the budget. So I just think the President is incorrect. And I wanted to make that comment. He is entitled to his own opinion, but I think we are entitled to look at the bill and we are entitled to look at the facts. 
This is Commerce II. This is the bill that the administration basically had rewritten--the bill. And this is the bill that we have on the floor, although it has been added to. And we have new mandates and new spending, and a tax cut and a drug provision. I don't show those on this chart. But this is the current bill that we have before us. 
There is a lot of new government in this. So the President calls its `hooey.' My comment is, these just happen to be the facts. That is what this bill has in it. This bill has a lot of money in it. It has a lot of spending in it. And I want to get into that because a lot of people have said, `Well, this bill, it is really only a $65 billion bill. It only raises taxes by $65 billion.' And this Senator, for one, has been saying, `Wait a minute. It's a lot more than that.' 
Where does this thing say in this bill, if you look at the bill and look at the language of the bill--and I would encourage my colleagues to do so, and anybody else. I had to ask unanimous consent to get the bill printed. The committee printed the Commerce I. They did not print Commerce II. This is the bill we have before us that is now printed on the Senators' desks. 
If they would look at the bill, maybe look at page 183 of the bill, it talks about annual payments. The bill does not say anything about 65 cents a pack; it does not say anything about $1.10 a pack. It does say consumers pay $10 billion the first year, $14 billion the second year, $15 billion the third year, $17 billion the fourth year, and $21 billion in the fifth year, without even considering look-back penalties. 
So if you total that, that is all $102 billion. That is what the bill says--$23.6 billion in the fifth year. And after that, those amounts are adjusted by inflation. That is on page 183 of the bill. 
If you put those figures in and you adjust them for inflation--it says 3 percent or inflation, whichever is greater. I just plugged in 3 percent. You do that, and you come out with $755 billion over 25 years. What is this nonsense we hear, `Well, we think it's only $516 billion'? This is $755 billion. That is in the bill. That is what we are considering, not $516 billion. 
And then the look-back potential. I show $130 billion of look-back potential. I say `potential' because it can be assessed. No one knows exactly how much that will be. But evidently a lot of people felt it should be much more, because this chart is obsolete. 
My colleague from Illinois, Senator Durbin, had an amendment to increase this to $7.7 billion and then index that for inflation. As a matter of fact, if you put the new figures into the chart, this $130 billion goes to a maximum of $241 billion. So you add that to the $755 billion and you get really right at $1 trillion--$1 trillion potential tax on consumers. And I say `tax on consumers' advisedly, because this bill mandates that 100 percent of this money be paid for by consumers. It does not say, `Tobacco companies, you pay this.' Basically, it says, `Tobacco companies, you pass this cost on. You pass every dime of this on.' 
So I make the point we are talking about, President Clinton may think it is a bunch of hooey, but this is a big government bill. 
It has lots of new agencies and hundreds of billions of dollars of new spending. With the new look-back potential, up to $1 trillion in money transferred from consumers to government. 
I make those points because I think it is important that we know the facts. Some people say this is not a budget buster, this is responsible, we are raising taxes. This bill doesn't say anything about taxes. It says these funds shall be paid, and 100 percent of the funds shall be passed on to consumers. It is not clear. It is not direct. It is confusing. And it is hard to tell exactly who is taxed how much. 
I will give an example. If a person looked at page 186 of the bill, we find out there are exclusions for some companies. To give an example--I looked this up--Marlboro, a Philip Morris brand, would have to pay presumably a price per pack of $1.10 more; this brand, Chesterfield, by the Ligget Group, pays zero. Now, both companies presently pay 24 cents per pack. Both of them do. Under this bill, supposedly, the price per pack on this item goes up $1.10; the price on this item goes up zero. So they will have a $1.10 advantage over all other competitors. Why? Because their sale volume isn't so large? Wait a minute; is that good tax policy? They have the same excise taxes today, but we are going to give a $1.10 advantage to one company versus another company? We do that in this bill? That doesn't make sense. 
We did the same thing in other tobacco products. Looking at smokeless tobacco, again if a person looked at page 186, we find out some companies have a significant differential. This product, Copenhagen, is made by U.S. Tobacco Company. This product is Kodiak, made by Conwood Company. Both have a current excise tax of 2.7 cents per product. 
This product made by U.S. Tobacco, the new tax increase is 82.5 cents; that is a 3,056-percent increase. This product, the tax increase is 57.8 cents; that is a 2,141-percent increase. This has a 25-cent advantage under this bill. This product has a 25-cent advantage. Why should we be choosing winners and losers in this bill? Is that good tax policy? Is that good consumer policy? We will encourage some people to buy this product over another product, but in the language in this bill on page 186, it gives certain items a competitive advantage over their competitors. Is that right? Is that in this bill? Sure it is in this bill. It is on page 186. I mentioned it on the floor before, and at some point I plan on addressing it if this bill stays on the floor. 
So the President said it wasn't a bunch of new government and I showed the charts. There is a lot of new government, tons of new government. There are new taxes that run into almost $1 trillion over 25 years. The money is all off budget, and that bothers me. 
Somebody was complaining Republicans may make a budget point of order. We well should. If a person looked at page 181 of the bill, talking about the national trust fund, it says, `The amount of such appropriations shall not be included in the estimates required under section 251 of the act,' talking about the Budget Act. So all the appropriations that were mandated out of this trust fund shall not be included in the budget, the budget that the President signed just last year with both Houses, the House and the Senate, and I will say with bipartisan support. We finally did get a budget that was supported by Democrats and Republicans. The President said we will stay by these caps. Even at the State of the Union, we will not spend one dime, not one dime unless we don't cut taxes. We want to save Social Security. 
But what he does in this bill is basically ignore the budget. The budget makes no difference. All this spending, hundreds of billions of dollars, are over and above the budget. They don't count towards the cap. They don't count toward the budget. It is over and above. All the taxes are above, all the expenditures are outside the budget realm. So certainly a budget point of order lies against this bill. As a matter of fact, if we don't make a budget point of order, I think we just might as well say we don't have a budget. There is no need to have a budget. There is not a budget. 
Why should the conferees, and I am a conferee on the budget for this year's budget, why should we worry about a budget if we are going to pass a bill that has tax increases and expenditures larger than any tax cut that anybody else is talking about in the budget that the President signed last year or in the budget that we are talking about this year? This has a larger tax increase, larger spending increase, than either the budget that was passed last year or the one that is contemplated for this year. So why have a budget, if it will all be outside the budget as stipulated on page 181 of the bill? 
So my colleague who earlier said we have taken a poll and now the people by some majority support this bill--they don't know what is in this bill. If you told the people that we are giving one brand of cigarettes an advantage of at least $1.10 over another brand, would they say that is fair? Don't we have a constitutional responsibility to be fair? Or if you are giving one smokeless tobacco product a competitive advantage over another one, does that make sense? 
What about some of the other tax provisions--if a person looked at page 104 of the bill, it talks about the look-back assessment. The look-back penalties, which I mentioned in the earlier charts originally, were $2 billion under the settlement, $4 billion under the Commerce Committee bill, Commerce II, the last bill we had on the floor, and then we had an amendment to increase the look-backs to $7.7 billion a year and index those for inflation. Who determines whether there is a look-back penalty or assessment or tax? The Secretary of Health and Human Services. How does she determine it? She takes a poll; she does a survey. It is in this legislation. She does a survey. I am talking about Secretary Shalala, the Secretary of Health and Human Services. She does a survey, and from the survey she has the power to assess fines, penalties or taxes equal to $7.7 billion a year. That is an unbelievable transfer of authority, of taxation authority, to the Secretary of Health and Human Services. 
In her survey, under the legislation, the survey-using methodology required by this subsection is deemed `conclusively to be proper, correct, and accurate for purposes of this act.' So her survey is deemed by this act, deemed to be correct, deemed to be accurate. And she has the capability to assess fines and penalties up to $7.7 billion per year, an unbelievable power of taxation by her survey which Congress is deeming to be correct. So they can assess companies $1,000 for whoever answered the survey wrong or inappropriately according to her wishes. Unbelievable power. 
Then we passed an amendment, I believe it is Senator Reed's amendment, that said we will deny deductibility of advertising to tobacco companies if they don't comply with FDA advertising restrictions. That is now part of this bill. What does that mean? FDA promulgated a long list of rules which, incidentally, I will comment on in a minute. This legislation deems to be law. That is interesting. But in the amendment Senator Reed says if they don't comply with FDA advertising restrictions, then they will lose deductions of their advertising. Basically, what we have done now is turned the power to tax over to the FDA. Now, that is unconscionable for those who think the power to tax belongs to Congress, not to a bureaucrat, a bureaucrat that may or may not have an agenda. 
And if one thinks that all the FDA regs are accurate and make sense, one of the regs is that you can't have any tobacco sponsorship for sporting events. The Indianapolis 500 comes to mind. An automobile runs around with `Marlboro' painted on the side. If you had that, or the driver had `Marlboro' on the side, it would be a violation. They would lose deductibility of all their advertising expenses. Or even if you had a hat that said `Marlboro' on it, or `Winston' or `Salem' or whatever, any tobacco product, if you had a hat or T-shirt or car that had that emblem, you are violating the FDA advertising restrictions and therefore you would lose your deductibility. 
So we would have tax policy being set, one, by the Secretary of Health and Human Services, and another by FDA. The combination of that is probably the worst tax policy I can imagine. Unbelievable. 
On page 99 of the bill, we do something else dealing with FDA regulations, 
and Congress is a legislative body. We are supposed to legislate. If we want to ban advertising of tobacco products, we should do it. Somebody should introduce a bill to ban advertising. We didn't do that. FDA promulgated some rules restricting tobacco sales, labeling and advertising. 
On page 99, it talks about the rules, and it says, `The code of Federal regulations dealing with tobacco are hereby deemed to be lawful and to have been lawfully promulgated by the secretary under Chapter 9 in Section 701 of the Food and Drug Act.' Here is a whole list of FDA regulations. This bill deems them to be the law, makes them the law. I am bothered by that. If somebody wants to make it the law, let them try to pass a bill--we are the legislative body, not FDA--not taking a whole section of FDA regs, some of which make no sense whatsoever, some of which are not workable. 
Here is one example. One reg deals with checking IDs, identification on people when they purchase tobacco products. Every State in the Nation has a law, and it is against the law to sell tobacco products to teenagers, people less than 18. Some States have higher age limits. They said we need to check that, and the rule said they are going to check the identification of people up to age 27. And if a convenience store, or something, doesn't comply, they are subjected to fines and penalties, which range, for the fifth violation, up to $10,000. Wait a minute, that isn't in the bill. But the bill says they are all deemed to be lawful. So we are making it law by this one paragraph on page 99. 
Now, if we stay on this bill, I am going to have an amendment saying, wait a minute, should it be against the law for a convenience store not to check the identification of people up to age 27? The law is 18. You could have a combat veteran of the Persian Gulf who is 26 years old and has four kids, and somebody could be fined up to $10,000 if they don't check his ID. Obviously, he is older than 18. Yet, the FDA reg says you check their identification, and if they are less than 26 or 27 and you didn't check the ID, you are subject to fines and penalties up to $10,000. And we are codifying that; we are deeming that to be lawful. That bothers me. That is crummy legislating. That is not good legislation. 
We have another provision that I don't even know many of our colleagues are aware of. They had better become aware of it if, Heaven forbid, this becomes law. This bill prohibits smoking of cigarettes in almost any building in the United States. I will read you the language. It prohibits the `smoking of cigarettes, cigars, pipes, and any other combustion of tobacco within a facility or on a facility or property within the immediate vicinity of the entrance to the facility.' I could go on. How is `facility' defined? It means `any building used for purposes that effect interstate or foreign commerce, regularly entered by 10 or more individuals at least one day per week.' 
Unbelievable. Unless you have a real small building, you are going to be covered by this ban. So we are banning smoking on almost every single building--certainly every business building in the United States, or significant business building. Are people aware of that? What kind of fines and penalties will be imposed if you don't comply with that? I could go on and on. 
My point is, when I heard my colleague say, `We think the public supports this bill,' maybe a lot of the public really haven't looked at what is in this bill. There are a couple of sections I will point out just for the information of our colleagues. I heard somebody say, `You can't be opposed to this bill now on attorney's fees,' because we passed an amendment by one vote that had a limitation on attorney's fees. They can only make $4,000 an hour for the old cases and, for future cases, $500 an hour. Well, Mr. President, there is language in this bill that is an invitation for litigation that would not stop, that would be probably the most expensive litigation piece I have ever seen. There is a presumption. I will just read this part on page 233 of the bill. It is just a couple of paragraphs, but the paragraphs 
would cost consumers hundreds of billions of dollars.  
General Causation Presumption. In any civil action to which this title applies involving a tobacco claim, there shall be evidentiary presumption that nicotine is addictive and that the diseases identified as being caused by use of tobacco products in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Reducing the Health Consequences of Smoking: 25 Years of Progress: A Report of the Surgeon General [back in 1989], The Health Consequences of Smoking: Involuntary Smoking [done in 1986]; and The Health Consequences of Using Smokeless Tobacco [Health Service in 1986], are caused in whole or in part by the use of tobacco products . . . 
There is an evidentiary presumption that nicotine is addictive and diseases are identified as being caused by using tobacco products. In other words: Come sue. Come sue for anything. There are three books, and they touch on all kinds of diseases, including diabetes. It can have some little relationship to smoking, and we made a presumption that: tobacco is the fault; come sue. This is an invitation for litigation. Here you go, the trial lawyers will love this. They came out with a big one. They may have snuck it in, I don't know. This is a big invitation to sue. I heard Senator Domenici talking about this. I compliment him for raising it on the floor. Other people acted like they didn't know it is in the bill. It is still in the bill. So I make those comments. 
I will make a couple of other comments. I see my friend from Kentucky here. I have already related the inequity of some of the taxation provisions in this bill dealing with either cigarettes or other tobacco products. We have currently pending an amendment by my colleague to strike out what some people have referred to as the Lugar provision, and I expect that there will be an amendment pending to strike out the Ford provision. Both of them deal with compensation for tobacco farmers. I think both are too generous. One has a total cost, over 25 years, of $28 billion; one has a cost of $18 billion. Both would compensate tobacco farmers far in excess of the value of the land--value of the land that you could buy today on the open market, but we would pay several times the value. I think that is a mistake. I am troubled by that provision. 
Mr. President, I don't know if this has been entered into the Record. I have a letter from the Governors urging opposition to this bill. These are the Governors whose attorneys general originally put together the package that said: Yes, we want to make a deal; we won't sue the tobacco companies if you will give us a couple hundred billion dollars over the next 25 years--about 8 billion a year. If you give us $8 billion a year, collectively, then we will drop our class action suits. They have now looked at this bill and said: Don't pass it. It is not acceptable in its current form. 
I happen to agree with the Governors--maybe for different reasons--but I don't think this bill is salvageable. I don't think we should pass it. Does that mean I am against doing something to reduce the teenage consumption and addiction of tobacco and drugs? Absolutely not. I want to do something. I have indicated that I am willing to pass a bill that would be directed, targeted, at reducing teenage consumption and addiction to tobacco. Do you have to spend hundreds of billions to do that, as we have in this legislation before us? The answer is no, absolutely not. As a matter of fact, I think what we are doing is funding an addiction of government to more government and doing very little on tobacco. 
If we want to do some things to reduce teenage consumption and addiction to tobacco, let's do it. We have the HHS appropriation bill. We can put in more money for NIH, for cancer research, for money to have programs to discourage drug consumption, tobacco consumption. Let's do that, increase it, and cancel some other programs. We are spending now $1.7 trillion per year. Let's move some of that around and put it into functions that would actually be targeted at our youth, to reduce their addiction and consumption of tobacco. I think that would be a giant step in the right direction. 
I think passing this legislation is not really targeted to kids; it is targeted more to government. The President was absolutely wrong when he said those people who oppose this bill and think it is more government, that is a bunch of hooey. I think we did something. We read the bill. This bill is a bunch of hooey. This does not deserve to be passed. 
I think this bill is a serious, serious mistake. If our colleagues on the other side of the aisle want to increase tobacco taxes, they can do so. This bill is, in my opinion, one of the worst pieces of legislation this Congress has considered in my legislative career. It should not pass. We should defeat this bill. We should defeat it either in the form of not agreeing to cloture--we have already had three cloture votes. We may well have one more. I hope my colleagues will not vote for cloture. I hope that a budget point of order, if that is made, will be sustained. 
This bill is clearly outside the budget. It says so in its language. Do we agree with the budget that we passed last year, or are we just going to ignore it on this issue? We ignored it on the urgent supplemental. We violated the budget on those. There were some emergencies. There were some floods and other emergencies required funding and we have done that for before. 
But to ignore the budget on these programs, all of which are in governmental entities, or creating governmental entities for new programs--for example, international tobacco control. That is $350 million a year for the first 5 years, and such sums as necessary for the future years. That is a brand new program. I don't know that we need to fund it. But if we do, let's fund it under the budget. Why have it be outside the budget? 
I look at a lot of these other programs. My colleagues were successful in saying, let's spend a couple billion dollars more in child care. We mandated that in this side of the equation. We have the tobacco community grants; opportunity grants. We have got a lot of new spending. I say that spending should be in the budget. It shouldn't be outside the budget. 
So I urge my colleagues, let's defeat this bill. Let's come back to something that is responsible, something that is within the realm of the budget agreement.

Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to vote against this amendment. 
First, let me say to the proponents that if they want to have an amendment to ban advertising, or deduction of advertising, for tobacco products, they can do so. But to turn it over to the FDA, I think, may be some of the worst tax policy we have seen. This bill already has some of the worst tax policy we have seen. The look-back penalties, as I have stated a couple of times, are clearly not working. But if I read this amendment right, advertising is deductible, unless it doesn't comply with FDA regulations. 
What are the FDA regulations? You are in violation of FDA regulations if you have a ball cap that says `Marlboro' on it. If I have a staff member who went to a car race, or something, that has a ball cap that says `Marlboro,' they would be in violation. I don't know if a ball cap under FDA regulations would be in violation of advertising restrictions. They would lose deductibility of their advertising expenses. 
Again, if people want to be more direct, let's be more direct. Just say, I have an amendment to disallow all advertising expenses for tobacco products. I expect some may have that. They probably will have it on this bill. But to say you cannot have the deduction unless you comply with FDA regulations, and treating FDA regulations as sacrosanct, as if they make sense--some of them don't make sense. For example, there is an FDA regulation that says people selling tobacco must check IDs up to age 27. A lot of people aren't aware of it. But that is part of the same FDA regulation that we are talking about. I don't think that is workable. It is legal to buy cigarettes if you are over 18. But if you are 18, and they come up with a regulation that says we are going to mandate that you check identification of people up to age 27--they also have restrictions on advertising that says you can't have a T-shirt, a ball cap, or tobacco companies--you can't advertise during the races. This is auto racing time--Indianapolis 500. My friend from Indiana is here. My guess is there was a car running around the track that had `Marlboro' on it. Somebody probably said, `Wait a minute. That is directed at youth.' I don't know if it is directed at youth or not. 
If they did it, if they sponsored a sporting event, they would be in violation of this provision and they would lose deductibility of advertising. 
I just do not think we should have FDA making tax policy. I do not think we should have FDA deciding what is compliance or whether a company is allowed to take the deduction. If Senators do not want to have tobacco advertising, they want to ban it, let them introduce that on a tax bill, but let's not turn that kind of authority over to FDA. I think this bill has already granted FDA too much authority, including the authority to totally ban nicotine without prior congressional approval, which I think is a mistake, and I think the ID check up to age 27 is a mistake. I think that is FDA overreaching. I think their ban on ball caps and T-shirts, again, is overreaching. 
Now, I do not want them targeting teenagers either, but I think to turn over tax policy to FDA would be a serious mistake. So I urge my colleagues to vote no on this amendment.

Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Arizona for not moving to table just yet because I would like to make a couple of comments concerning the amendment that is pending. 
The amendment that is pending deals with section 452 of this bill. Section 452 deals with how the money is going to be spent, or at least how it applies to the States. It has a couple of different sections. It states: `Restricted Funds.' That is, 50 percent that States could spend any way they wish. That is under title (b). 
Under the funding for child care, under section 418 of the Social Security Act, it has some new language that was put in. I don't know what the purpose of it is, but it states that notwithstanding subsection (b)(2) of that section--we looked that up and basically it means we eliminate the means testing for this program. The program that we are dealing with in child care is supposed to be for low income, and now we find this tobacco bill coming in and saying, well, we are going to eliminate means testing. So millionaires' kids will qualify for this. 
That is not the purpose of the child care block grant program. And then the child care block grant program was supposed to be on a State share identical to Medicaid. In some States, that is 50-50, 50 percent Federal, 50 percent State. We put in a little change in this bill that says it is 80-20, 80 percent Federal, 20 percent State. 
Now, I am bothered by that. I am bothered by it for two or three different reasons. One, I have stated all along I have felt this entire bill was a tax-spend bill. We raise a lot of taxes. We are transferring about $102 billion from consumers over the first 5 years--I think over 25 years probably well in excess of $8- or $900 billion but just for the first 5 years alone, $102 billion. Half of that money we allocate and we say to the States, you are going to get your fair share, you are going to get part of it, and now we dictate how the States have to do it. But now we find out there is a little language change to say, well, we are going to allocate this new money; we are going to take child care development block grants, which right now total about $3 billion, and we are going to make it $5 
billion. This is $2 billion on top of what we already have. That is a 66-percent increase per year. 
Then we change the eligibility and say it is not means tested. Then we change the ratio where the States don't have to put up their matching share in Medicaid. We just say the Federal Government is going to pay 4 to 1--80 percent Federal Government, 20 percent by the State. So we have a massive expansion of an entitlement program, a massive expansion of who is eligible. We make higher income people eligible. It is just another way to see, can't we funnel more money? Can't we spend more money? This is living proof this amendment is not about curbing smoking. It has nothing to do with curbing smoking--nothing, not one thing. It is not going to reduce consumption by teenagers one iota, but it will spend $50 billion. 
The amendment that we have before us says to the States, you will spend 50 percent, or basically $49.25 billion, over the next 25 years in child care, basically $2 billion a year--$2 billion a year for a program in which we are already spending $3 billion. So we spend $3 billion now. We increase that $2 billion per year, a 66-percent increase in spending on child care development block grants. Then we change the rules and say, well, we don't have means testing on the new money. And we won't use the old Federal match of Medicaid. We are going to come up with a new match that says, Federal Government, you have to pay four times as much as the States. I think that is a serious mistake. 
Mr. President, I hope that our colleagues will say, wait a minute, this is not about reducing smoking. This amendment has nothing to do with reducing smoking. It does have to do with increasing social spending. It is something that some people maybe have wanted to do. It is something we have had an increase on in the last couple of years. But I would just urge my colleagues, this is not the right way to spend this money. This is people saying, wait a minute, there is money available. Let's take it and use it for what we deem is right. It has nothing whatsoever to do with curbing teenage consumption or addiction to tobacco or drugs, and so I would urge my colleagues to vote in favor of the McCain tabling motion.

Mr. President, I just want to thank both my friend and colleague from Massachusetts, as well as from Arizona, for accepting this modification. The modification did a couple of things. One, as I stated prior to the vote, we didn't want to pass an expansion that would basically take the means testing off of the child care development block grant, nor did we want to change the allocation or the ratio of the State match. We have corrected that. 
I thank my friends and my colleagues for doing that. I have no objection to the unanimous consent request.

Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I rise in support of the amendment by the Senator from Alabama and the Senator from North Carolina to try to put at least some limit or some reasonableness on legal fees in this bill. 
I have heard some of my colleagues say, `Wait a minute. What about the Michael Jordans and the Bill Gates, and others?' They are not compensated out of the public trust fund that comes 
from a tax, that comes from a fee, whichever you want to call it. I call it a tax that is set up by Congress. Congress is in the process of raising taxes and fees in the first 5 years of $102 billion. That is a lot of money. And over the 25-year period, you usually hear the figure of $516 billion. But it is a lot more than that. $516 billion doesn't index for inflation, and so on. We have already had charts on the floor that show it to be up to $880-some billion. That doesn't even count the amendment of Senator Durbin that was passed the other night that increased the look-back penalties from $4 billion a year to about $7.7 billion a year. So we may well have a tax package that over the next 25 years will transfer from consumers--not tobacco companies, from consumers--maybe $900 billion; maybe closer to $1 trillion. 
These legal fees are coming out of this fund. This is a fund created by Congress. If this bill should become law--and I hope and pray that it doesn't, but if it does--these moneys are mandated by an act of Congress, and we have every right to say we want to make sure that the money goes to where we intend it to go. 
I have heard everybody say we want it to go to reduce teenage consumption of tobacco. Now we say and also consumption and addiction to drugs. I think likewise we have every right--as a matter of fact, we have an obligation--to make sure that we don't spend excessively on legal fees. We want the money to go to its stated purpose--not to be going to enhance a few trial attorneys. In some cases these trial attorneys would become not just millionaires but billionaires. 
Mr. President, there was an article in the Washington Times on June 7th. It talked about attorneys saying they deserve up to $92,000 an hour. This is written by Joyce Price in the Washington Times. It goes on. I will read a couple of paragraphs and insert it in the Record. 
It says the Orioles owner in Baltimore, Peter Angelos, who earlier this decade earned about $250 million for representing ailing factory workers exposed to asbestos, stands to receive as much as $875 million if he settles the State suit against tobacco companies to recover the cost of treating a smoking-related illness. It goes on. It talks about the Florida case. It talks about the Texas case. It talks about the total settlement of $113 billion. But the trial attorneys would receive $2.8 billion, or as much as 24.7 percent of the total received in Florida. In Texas, the total amount of settlement was $l5.3 billion in legal fees and $2.2 billion or $2.3 billion, or about 15 percent. 
Mr. President, those are outlandish fees. Those are fees in the neighborhood of $100,000 per hour. If those States negotiated, maybe that is one thing. But for crying out loud. We shouldn't set up a fund that is going to compensate trial attorneys all across the country to receive those kind of fees, and act like we are doing it so we can reduce teenage consumption and addiction to tobacco. That is ridiculous. 
Certainly it makes sense for us, if we are going to create this trust fund, if we are going to have amendments, as my friend and colleague from Massachusetts just had, an amendment which said let's spend maybe $2 billion more in child care development. I didn't support it. He won. He had the votes; congratulations to him. But we have the authority to say here is where the money is going to go. This is Congress. So he won on his amendment. I don't agree with it. I think it further confirms that this bill is a tax-and-spend bill. 
But on the spending side we have a right to say we are going to limit on how much money we are going to spend in administrative costs and in legal fees. I think it is one of the most important amendments that we have. 
I urge my colleagues to vote yes. I will tell my colleagues if they don't support this at $1,000 an hour we are going to come back with another one and maybe another one. Where is the limit going to be? Surely we are going to have a limit?

Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, today I rise, along with Senators Lott, Coats, Inhofe, Helms, Murkowski, Grams of Minnesota, Faircloth, Bond, Enzi, Sessions, Hagel, and Coverdell to introduce the Lethal Drug Abuse Prevention Act of 1998. This legislation will clarify that physicians entrusted by the federal government with the authority to prescribe and dispense controlled substances may not abuse that authority by using them in assisted suicides. It also strongly reaffirms that physicians should use federally controlled substances for the legitimate medical purpose of relieving pain and discomfort. 
Last year, Congress passed the Assisted Suicide Funding Restriction Act of 1997 without a dissenting vote in the Senate and by an overwhelming margin of 398-16 in the House. The President signed the bill, saying it `will allow the Federal Government to speak with a clear voice in opposing these practices,' and warning that `to endorse assisted suicide would set us on a disturbing and perhaps dangerous path.' 
The distribution of narcotics and other dangerous drugs is prohibited by federal law under the Controlled Substances Act. Under this law physicians may get a special federal license from the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), called a DEA registration, that allows them to prescribe these federally controlled drugs for `legitimate medical purposes.' This was confirmed last November in a letter by Thomas Constantine, Administrator of the DEA, who concluded that `delivering, dispensing or prescribing a controlled substance with the intent of assisting a suicide would not be under any current definition a legitimate medical purpose.' 
It is important to understand that while physicians receive their license to practice medicine from state medical boards, they receive this separate DEA registration to prescribe controlled substances from the federal DEA. Each time a doctor orders a controlled substance they must fill our a form in triplicate and one copy goes to the DEA. Physicians must be prepared to explain to DEA officials their use of these drugs, and they lose their registration and even risk criminal penalties if they prescribe such drugs for any reason but `Legitimate medical purposes.' 
On June 5, Attorney General Janet Reno issued a decision which overturned the DEA ruling. According to the Attorney General, the Controlled Substances Act does not restrict the use of federally controlled dangerous drugs for the purpose of assisted suicide. It is for this reason I am introducing this legislation. 
I have long been a strong advocate of states' rights and the limited role of the federal government, so let me make clear what this legislation does. It simply clarifies that the dispensing of controlled substances for the purpose of assisted suicide is prohibited under longstanding federal law, the Controlled Substance Act. 
This is not the first time the federal government has acted to ensure that federally regulated drugs are not used for purposes that violate federal law. The current Administration is committed to enforcing federal prohibitions on the use of marijuana, despite state referenda that seeks to legitimize such use for what some see as medicinal use. By the same token, one state's referendum rescinding local criminal penalties for assisting a suicide does not magically transform a lethal act into a legitimate medical practice within the meaning of federal law. 
Congress cannot remain silent now. Congress acted with one voice to ensure that no federal program, facility or employee is involved in assisted suicide. Enactment of the Lethal Drug Abuse Prevention Act of 1998 will ensure that federal authorization to prescribe DEA-regulated drugs does not include the authority to prescribe such drugs to cause a patient's death. 
I urge my colleagues to support and swiftly enact this urgently needed legislation.

Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I am going to make fairly lengthy remarks dealing with the contents of the bill. First, let me just state my respect and admiration for Chairman McCain. He is a very good friend of mine in the Senate. One of the things we have a pleasure of doing in the Senate--we are not a very big body--so we get a chance to know each other sometimes pretty well. I have had the pleasure of working and knowing Senator McCain since he came to the Senate. He is a very good friend of mine. He will still be a good friend of mine. 
I don't like his bill. I don't like the procedure by which the bill is being considered, and I was involved in the procedure. Senator Lott asked me to head up the task force to try to put this bill together. Senator McCain, and the Commerce Committee, had a lot of jurisdiction over the bill, probably more than any other committee. Also, he had to deal with the issue of whether or not we are going to have a limitation on liability for tobacco companies. 
Probably the most important issue is whether the attorneys general package will either pass or not pass, it is very pertinent to the amendment that the Senator from New Hampshire has pending before the Senate today. Are we going to give a limitation on liability to tobacco companies? We don't do it for other companies, with very, very few exceptions. I think we did it for the airline industry for a small, targeted area, but, by and large, we don't do this for any industry in America. We don't do it for pharmaceuticals. We don't do it for people who make heart valves, and so on. A liability limitation was in the attorneys general's package that they dumped on Congress, that they signed off with the administration. The administration agreed with that package, the so-called $368 billion 25-year package. That was handed to Congress and they said, `Here, go pass it.' 
I told some of my colleagues from the outset I don't think we will pass legislation--nor do I think we should--that will put a total limitation on class action lawsuits. If you are using in tobacco, you can't have a class action lawsuit against tobacco companies? That is what the attorneys general's package was going to do. In exchange for that, tobacco companies were going to pay about $15 billion a year. That was the so-called deal. 
They didn't consult very many people in Congress, and I thought at the time they are going to have a hard time passing that restriction on liability. If they don't have that, they don't have a deal. Frankly, as this process evolved and the Commerce Committee marked up the bill, they struck some of the liability protections on exemption from class action suits, and instead came up with a cap--which is kind of a back end way of trying to do somewhat the same thing. The tobacco companies said, wait a minute, you have increased the price, you have increased the penalties, you have increased everything, and you gave us very little legal protection--this cap. Anyway, the tobacco companies said that is not good enough, there is no deal, we are not going to abide by it. 
The only way this could conceivably be in the Commerce Committee instead of the Finance Committee is we say there will be payments of fees in lieu of protection for liability. But it didn't work out that way. So then we had a referral to the Finance Committee. The Finance Committee struck out this fee structure, which I think is a disaster. I see my friend and colleague from Nebraska here is also on the Finance Committee. I will go through, and it will take some time, but I will go through how the tax is computed or the fees are computed in this bill, and just say that it won't work very well. 
I also want to say I concur with the objectives of trying to reduce teen smoking. I don't want teenagers to smoke. I have four kids. One out of my four smokes, and he happens to be 28 years old. He started when he was in high school. I really wish that he didn't smoke. I grew up in a family--both my parents and all my brothers and sisters--all of them smoked. My mother has had lung cancer and emphysema, very critical. She still is a survivor, but it is a very serious problem. A couple of my brothers and sisters had a hard time quitting. They did quit. They were able to do it. One in my family didn't have that hard of a time of quitting. I am trying to get my son to quit and I have not been successful. I wish that he would. I really wish that he would. 
When you look at the use of tobacco products, you can see that it is pretty significant. This chart shows anybody who has ever used cigarettes in their lifetime, kind of an unusual statistic. I guess I would fall into it because I know I smoked one or two cigarettes when I was in junior high--probably never a full pack. But I guess, if somebody said, did you ever smoke a cigarette, I would have to say, yes, sometime in the 8th grade. So I would be in the 70 percent category--you might notice from this chart that usage went down a little bit in the last few years. Frankly, under the Clinton administration it started going up. 
Marijuana use has also gone up--and I am more concerned about drugs than I am smoking. I will make that evident in a moment. But marijuana use, which was up to 60 percent and has fallen down to about 33 percent, fell almost every year through the 1980s until, frankly, President Clinton was elected. Then it has gone up and it has gone up in a skyrocketing fashion. As a matter of fact, I will insert in the Record this chart. I tell my friend and colleague from Nebraska that marijuana use in 1992 among 12th graders was 11.9 percent. Last year, it was 23.78 percent --100 percent increase of marijuana use among high school seniors. That is a staggering statistic. 
This is marijuana use by people categorized as `frequent users' who have used it in the last 30 days. You can see on the chart that this has jumped up. You also see tobacco use has gone up. Cigarette use has gone up. In 1992, cigarette consumption among seniors in high schools was 27.8 percent. In 1997, it was 36.5 percent, an increase of about a third. That is a big increase. You could go all the way back to the 1960s as to who uses cigarettes on a frequent basis or in the last 30 days, and it was very constant for decades, until frankly, the Clinton administration. And during these 5 or 6 years, it has gone up a third, the biggest increase that we have seen. 
You might also note, and this is more troubling to me, that marijuana use had gone down for frequent users, down to only about 11 or 12 percent in the early 1990s. And now it is more than double and is up to about 24 percent. Now, that bothers me. And I cannot help but think a lot of people, when they are just going after tobacco and how terrible it is, are fairly silent about drug use, drug use that is habitual, drug use that is illegal, drug use that is deadly, drug use that leads to lots of other crimes, lots of other problems. 
Why only the attention on cigarettes? Why only the attention on cigarettes? We are going to have some amendments which will have significant attention on drugs. I had a town meeting during the Easter break in Oklahoma--I had several--but I had one in Shawnee, OK, a middle-class town. This town meeting happened to have a lot of high school students, a lot. I told them we were debating the cigarette tax issue and I just asked how many smoked, and hardly any hands went up. 
I said, `Well, let me ask you a question. Congress is contemplating raising tobacco prices by $1.10, maybe $1.50. Would that make any difference for those of you that raised your hands?' The answer was, `No, we don't smoke that much.' Maybe they would smoke on a weekend or at a party. They said it would make no difference. That is an informal survey; it is not scientific. But some claim that scientists say if we raise this tax, we are going to reduce teen smoking. I am not sure that is the case. I think when you ask the question if somebody smoked in the last 30 days, that means one cigarette or two cigarettes. I am not sure you are going to have an appreciable reduction because you raise prices a dollar. Maybe there would be some. Maybe it would be a component in reducing teen smoking, but some people are acting like it is the whole battle. I disagree with that. I don't think it would work. 
As a matter of fact, I am kind of amused because now we hear everybody say our objective is that if we raise these prices, these taxes, spend all this money and run this massive campaign, we will be successful and we can reduce teen smoking by 60 percent. If you are against this, you are for tobacco companies and you are against kids. I reject that outright. I don't like smoking. I don't like teen smoking, especially. I don't like to see kids smoke. But that doesn't mean you have to sign onto a program that spends hundreds of billions of dollars. 
I looked at a statement of Secretary Shalala when she announced new FDA regulations with David Kessler in August of 1995. They came up with a lot of new regulations. I don't agree with a lot of them. I think they are overly intrusive. But whether I agree with them or not, they stated in those regulations they thought they could reduce children and adolescent smoking by 50 percent within 7 years. Wait a minute. We are talking about spending hundreds of billions of dollars in addition to these FDA regulations to it to 60 percent? So these massive price and tax increases might decrease smoking another 10 percent in addition to what they are already doing in FDA? I am not so sure. 
That tells me that people are sometimes pretty loose with statistics. Maybe these surveys don't mean as much as some people think. Maybe this question of, `Did you smoke in the last 30 days?'--maybe that is one cigarette. I am not sure. That is one of the questions. 
My point is that I don't want kids to get addicted to smoking. We want to do some things to discourage that. I am concerned when I see that drug use has doubled; marijuana use has doubled under this administration amongst high school seniors. That bothers me a whole lot more than the 33 percent increase in teen consumption tobacco. I happen to be a parent; I have four kids. If you tell me that maybe they smoked a cigarette once, or if they were using marijuana on a regular basis, I would be a lot more concerned about the marijuana. I don't want them to do either, and we should discourage both. But to have a campaign and have this massive effort to attack tobacco and be silent on drugs, I think, is absurd and it should not happen. 
We should have a campaign against teen smoking, but we should not raid taxpayers in the process. We should not spend hundreds of billions of dollars. If you ask people, `Do you want to reduce teen smoking?' you are going to get a favorable poll that says 90 percent say yes. If you say, `We are going to reduce teen smoking, and we are going to spend hundreds of billions of dollars and pass the largest tax increase in years. Do you still think we should do it?' They are going to say, `What?' 
I think there was a poll that said 70 percent of the people thought Congress is doing this more to spend money than to help kids. They know this is more about a money grab, a big `cookie jar,' than about reducing teen smoking. Look at the costs. I happen to be kind of a numbers cruncher. I am on the Budget Committee and the Finance Committee and I think numbers are important. 
I am going to talk about this bill quite a lot this morning. I looked through this bill, and in this bill there is no mention anywhere of a $1.10 tax increase. I am going to tell the press there is no mention of a $1.10 per pack tax increase in this bill. They mention it in the committee report, but the committee report is not the law. So how much does this bill cost? I stated repeatedly that it costs more than a $1.10; and it does cost a lot more than $1.10. People will say, wait a minute, where did you get the figures? I got the figures from the bill, not from Senators' statements or from reading The Washington Post or The New York Times, where the headline was `Senate to Stay With $1.10 Tax Increase.' There is not a $1.10 tax increase in this bill; there is a lot more. It is going to cost consumers a lot more. Is it going to cost tobacco companies a lot more? I don't think so. 
As a matter of fact, I put on this chart the gross tax increase on consumers in billions of nominal dollars. These new taxes cost consumers, but do they cost tobacco companies? Not a dime. Let me go through a couple of the provisions, Mr. President. Before I do, I will submit the chart I have already discussed about the increase in use of marijuana and also cigarettes into the Record.

Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I am also going to insert a table that shows new tax assessments and penalties that are in this bill. The national tobacco settlement trust fund is what I am going to talk about now. This is the trust fund, the big kahuna. There are a lot of other taxes, penalties, but this is the bulk of the money. If a person was interested, they could look at this provision in the bill. If you go to page 179, it talks about the trust fund. You can see on page 181 that it says tobacco companies, in the first year, pay $10 billion. Then on page 182, it says--in the first year, you also pay $14.4 billion. That is the reason why the first year payments are $24.4 billion on my chart. It doesn't say anything about a $1.10 tax, or any other tax. It says, industry, you pay $24.4 billion. I have heard some people say, well, we are going to raise the tax gradually to $1.10. It starts out at 65 cents. The only mention of a per pack tax is in the committee report. It starts at 65 cents and ends with $1.10. 
I am just telling you that those numbers don't add up. I have told this to my colleague from North Dakota, and maybe he will believe me by the time I finish this presentation. The bill doesn't mention $1.10. We are passing a bill, not a committee report. We are passing a bill. The bill says in the second year the companies will pay $15.4 billion. The third year is $17.7 billion, then $21.4 billion, and then $23.6 the fifth year. Thereafter, it is adjusted for inflation. That is where these numbers come from. These numbers are adjusted for inflation. At a minimum of 3 percent, regardless of whether there is any inflation or CPI, whichever is greater. The bill says a minimum, so I put in the 3 percent. 
Now, some of my colleagues and the administration said this bill raised $516 billion. That number is in the committee report. The committee report embarrasses me. I am embarrassed by the work that the Commerce Committee put together, but frankly I shouldn't really blame them. I want to blame the administration because, frankly, they wrote the bill. It wasn't the Commerce Committee; it was the administration. The administration-drafted report even has a section that says payments will be no greater than $516 billion. That is hogwash. As a matter of fact, I have a letter from OMB that says you only compute $516 billion if you deflate the industry payments to constant 1999 dollars. That is where they get $516 billion. Those are constant 1999 dollars. They make it look a lot smaller than it is. 
Frankly, that is not the way we do accounting in the Senate. The bill says, here are the payments and they are adjusted for inflation, and, frankly, these are conservative because I will tell you that sometime in the next 25 years, you are going to have more than a 3 percent inflation rate. We know that. So I am going to tell you that the $755 billion in industry payments over the next 25 years is conservative. It is much more conservative than what will actually happen. I will also mention that I didn't add look-back assessments. The administration, when they said $516 billion also didn't add the look-back. Then, they increased the look-back to $4.4 billion when they rewrote the bill over the weekend. The administration rewrote the bill over the weekend, not the Commerce Committee or the Finance Committee. The Finance Committee reported out a bill and some amendments and said, let's scrap this industry payment nonsense and come up with a tax increase. I didn't support it--a $1.50 tax increase--but at least it was honest. 
This bill is very misleading. These industry payments are very deceiving. We ought to be ashamed of ourselves. I will talk about the look-back provisions in a minute. I didn't even add the look-back, yet, but if you add the look-back at another $130 billion the total tax increase is $885 billion. These are just the facts. These are the facts that you get if you read the bill--if you read the bill on page 182, page 183 and page 184. 
Then you find out that they did a lot of other silly things in this bill. I guess silly things maybe to protect certain constituents or certain parts of the industry. But, if you think you are passing a $1.10 tax on all tobacco, you will find out that they exempted some companies. They exempted some companies. I thought excise taxes were excise taxes, like excise taxes on gasoline--the Federal excise tax is on all gasoline, made in North Dakota and Oklahoma. Except perhaps for gasohol. I don't think we should exempt gasohol. But we do. But this bill exempts certain companies from the tax. If their sales are less than 1 percent, they pay no tax. What does that mean? You already have a 24-cent Federal excise tax on cigarettes. Everybody pays it. There is no exemption on that. Congress has already increased that in the future to go up to another 15 cents. That is going to be 39 cents. Everybody pays that. But this committee said for this additional tax or fee some companies need not pay. Think about that. 
Everybody else is going to have to pay this. Let's say the tax is $1.10. I think it is much more than that. But most companies will have $1.10 additional cost put on their products, and some companies won't. That makes sense, doesn't it? 
I also looked at the tax increases on other products. I would love to have a sponsor of the bill explain to me how they did this. Take a product like snuff. I calculated the tax increase on snuff, that little round package, you know, you put a pinch between your check and your gum. The tax increase on snuff is over 3,000 percent. That is a significant tax increase. Right now it is 2.7 cents per little can, and it goes up to 85 cents. That is a pretty good increase. Maybe 85 cents is the right amount. But I will venture to say nobody in here knows that. That little can costs about $3 and something. That is a pretty good hit. 
We at least ought to know what we are doing. I don't think anybody here knows what they are doing. 
Then we find in the bill that some smokeless tobacco companies, small manufacturers, are getting a smaller tax increase, 60 cents. For most of the snuff people, the people who make these little round things, we are going to increase their tax by 82.5 cents. But for some people we are only going to increase it 60 cents, because they are small, or maybe because their Senator said, `Hey, they are not part of the problem, they are not very big. They sell less than 150 million units.' I thought we were interested in children's addiction. So we are going to give this company a 20-some-cent advantage over other companies? That is in the bill. That is on page 185, if anybody cares to look at it. I wonder how many of us really looked at this bill. 
Excise taxes, if they are going to be on snuff, should apply to everybody. But we didn't do that in this bill. I say `we,' the Commerce Committee. The Finance Committee did tax everyone, and in proportion to the tax on cigarettes. Finance said, `Let's scrap all this industry payment nonsense and have an excise tax.' 
I am going to show you that this tax is a lot more than one dollar and a dime. And I don't think there is any question it is more than a dollar and a dime. Yet, people are still under the facade that this is $1.10. Why? Because OMB said it is, and Treasury said it is. I don't think that is the truth. The bill says, here is the amount of the industry payment, pay it. Not everybody has to pay. One company made a deal, and said, `Hey, we have already settled. So we are not part of the problem. So we don't have to pay the excise tax.' They have a much better deal. It is worth hundreds of millions of dollars. We are getting ready to pass it. I don't think that makes sense. I think we ought to be ashamed of ourselves the way we are legislating. 
There is a reason why we have committees of jurisdiction. And we violated it grossly. I thought maybe we fixed it when the Finance Committee took this bill. But, obviously, the Commerce Committee and the administration said, `No, we don't want to do that. We like what we have.' I will tell you why. Because they 
are going to get more money, in my opinion, than they would get at $1.50. 
I was halfway tempted to vote for the amendment of the Senator from Massachusetts amendment to raise the tax to $1.50. If you had a real tax at $1.50, I think it raises less money than the figures we are talking about. Maybe I am wrong. The press is going to report $1.10 and $1.50. That is what the press reports. I think this payment scheme equates to more than $1.50. This chart shows $40 billion or $50 billion per year in the future. Guess how many packs are sold a year? About 24 billion packs a year. If you have a $1 tax, assuming you had no reduction in consumption, you are talking about $24 billion. This bill is in that neighborhood already in the first year--not just the fifth year. We are talking about the first year. That is going to be about a $1 tax paid for 1999. You have the $10 billion initial payment. That equates to about $1 a pack. The tax on snuff and smokeless, and so on, doesn't raise a lot of money cumulatively, but it is a huge tax increase. 
On chewing tobacco, the tax goes from a very small two-and -a-quarter cents per 3 ounce pack of chewing tobacco to over 40 cents--almost 41 cents. That is a 1,711-percent increase in one fell swoop. That is a big hit. I think it is a nasty habit. If you want to tax it and eliminate it, maybe that is what some people are trying to do. But we at least ought to know what we are doing. I would venture to say that maybe a lot of people in the Senate don't. 
I want to talk a little bit about the look-back provisions. I think I heard Senator Hatch, and others, say that the look-back is unconstitutional. I think he is right. I will tell you, I am not a constitutional scholar. I will not enter that debate. I will tell you, it is unworkable. I heard somebody say the industry has signed off on the look-back provisions. I have not been talking to the industry, but I am pretty sure they are planning on contesting them on constitutional grounds. And they are pretty confident--at least that is what my staff tells me--that they would win. 
What does the look-back do? It could raise a lot of money. And evidently the administration thinks this is real money and it is going to happen because they increased the amount to $4.4 billion over the weekend. The look-back grew by over 10 percent over the weekend. It is much higher now than when it passed out of the Commerce Committee. 
That is interesting. How does it work? If a person was interested, they could look on page 106 of the bill and find the look-back section. This is kind of interesting. How does this work? Is this going to be a real incentive for companies to curtail smoking? I found out these provisions are very interesting. They start on page 103 of the bill and go through to page 109. I will just talk about this for a second. 
The look-back says the Secretary--talking about the Secretary of Treasury--shall conduct a survey to determine methodology and the percentage of all young people who use a type of tobacco product within the last 30 days. It says `a type of tobacco product within 30 days.' He is going to take a survey, a poll. 
A lot of us are in the political business. All of us in the Senate take polls. The Secretary of the Treasury is going to take a poll. Keep in mind that of all tobacco consumption, only 3 percent of it is done by teenagers. Keep in mind that it is against the law for teenagers to smoke in every State. It is against the law to smoke if you are less than 18 years old. He is going to take a poll and find out how many are trying tobacco. These numbers are going up. Maybe they did it once, or more. They are going to take a poll. The poll is going to also specify: `Did you use tobacco?' and `What brand did you use?' 
Then there is a complicated formula. But if a tobacco company's numbers don't come down, then we are going to be subject to special assessments. 
I should mention more about the poll--this is interesting. Every poll that I have ever seen has pluses and minuses. There is a range of plus or minus 4 percent. This cannot be entirely accurate, because they are not going to ask every teenager age 11 through 17, `Did you smoke?' That wouldn't be too cost effective. They might do it maybe for that reason. 
On page 106, it says, the survey is deemed conclusively to be proper, correct, and accurate for purposes of this act. They deem their poll whenever they happen to take it to be accurate. 
That is interesting. I just think of the games that could be played with that. 
Let's see, if they took their poll around the Fourth of July, there may be a greater instance of tobacco use on the 4th of July, or maybe the Memorial Day weekend, or maybe the Labor Day weekend when people are going to the beach. If they want to jack the penalties up, `Let's take the poll then.' 
I just fail to see that this is a good way to do business. If the company doesn't meet the underage tobacco use goals as outlined by this bill, then there would be significant penalties--very significant penalties, up to about $4.4 billion, and indexed for inflation. So on my chart the totals increase rather significantly to $130 billion. Those aren't tax deductible. 
Is that really workable? 
Then there is another section. 
There is an additional look-back assessment on brand-specific underage tobacco problems. If you look on page 112, which talks about if they miss their percentage share, tobacco companies could have an additional surcharge of $1,000 per teenager. 
The amount of the manufacturer-specific surcharge for a type of tobacco product for a year under this paragraph is $1,000 multiplied by the number of individuals for which such firm is in noncompliance with respect to its target level reduction. 
So we have target-level reductions. It starts out at 15 percent. It gradually increases to 60 percent. They are going to take a survey and find out what brand of cigarettes this youngster is smoking. So in this random survey, if a bunch of kids say, `Yes, I had a Marlboro,' mark them down, and for every child they determine smoked that brand of cigarette, they are going to assess the company another $1,000. 
Now, I find that to be ludicrous. There are hundreds of brands of cigarettes--hundreds, and so we are going to have the Department of Treasury conducting this poll asking teenagers did you smoke. And if you did, what brand? And it may be they can remember the brand, maybe they can't. Maybe they smoked one cigarette; maybe they bummed a cigarette; maybe they don't tell the truth; maybe they don't respond; or maybe whatever. We are going to be assessing penalties to the tune of $1,000 for every teenager deemed by this poll to have used this particular product. 
That is ludicrous. I want to warn my colleagues. I may not have the votes, but I am going to probably try and strike that. If we don't strike that, it is going to come back to haunt you. You are going to be embarrassed because we put language in here that says this poll was deemed to be accurate and therefore whatever the Secretary says is law and as a result here is your penalty. We have determined that there are 10,000 youngsters in the age category who are using your brand and they are age 17 or less, and therefore we are going to sock it to you. 
This doesn't make sense. If you want to figure out ways to punish tobacco, to fine tobacco, do it. But this is not the right way. This is not workable. You should trash this whole thing and say, if you want to increase tobacco tax $1.10, do it. Do it tomorrow. This thing phases it in over five years. 
My point being, if you are going to try to reduce consumption, you want to have a sticker price shock. You don't phase it in over 5 years. They will never see it. They won't know it. It won't make the reduction in use. It won't get consumption down. It won't be effective. 
Wow, what did we do. We raised hundreds of billions of dollars, but did we achieve our objective? I don't think so. What did we do? Maybe the objective was to raise billions of dollars so we would have a lot of money to spend. Maybe that's the case. I don't know. I hope not.

Mr. NICKLES. I have a lot to say.

<TEXT>
Mr. NICKLES. Let me go to that, and I appreciate the Senator's comments because I knew the bill's proponents would say my numbers don't assume a volume adjustment. 
The administration, when they did their projection to come up with a $516 billion price tag for this bill, they did no volume adjustment. When the AGs came up with their price tag for the settlement, they didn't do a volume adjustment. And finally, we discovered that the White House changed the volume adjustment threshold in this legislation over the weekend. That bothers me a lot. That was changed Sunday or Monday night. And that bothers me a lot. 
Let me conclude. I know what my colleague is going to say. 
Let me take you through this a little bit further. 
The volume adjustments, the formula that passed out of the Commerce Committee says the industry payments will be reduced by the volume. If there is a reduction in sales, we will reduce the tax. Again, in calculating the costs of their own bills, both the $516 billion current dollar estimate and the $755 billion nominal dollar estimate, they didn't calculate the volume adjustment. 
Now, what happened Sunday and Monday night was a humongous tax increase that nobody knows about because the volume adjustment was triggered not when sales dropped below 100 percent of 1997; it is triggered when sales drop below 80 percent of 1997. So you get no volume reduction unless you reduce total consumption to below 80 percent where we are today. So I am not sure there will be a volume adjustment ever. 
Now, I do not know if my colleague caught that. In the original Commerce bill, it says we will take these figures on my chart and we will reduce them, if there is a reduction in volume of sales. We will have a CPI increase, and we will have a volume decrease, and so maybe the figure will stay close to $23 billion. If volume went down 3 percent and CPI went up 3 percent, maybe you could take this figure, $23 billion, for all future years. 
Well, what they did in the stealth of the night of Sunday or Monday, they said, oh, we are going to change that. We are not going to give a volume adjustment unless they reduce total consumption to below 80 percent of where it was in 1997. Wow. 
Now, this is getting too complicated. Most of our colleagues aren't going to follow it, and I don't want to get too bogged down in the minutia, but that is a big tax increase. That means you are not going to have reductions. You may never have a reduction. 
My point being, that the way you do volume adjustment, the real way is to have a direct excise tax on the product--very clean, very simple. You don't have to argue about whether or not you are talking about constant dollars, inflated dollars, whether you are talking about volume adjusted. If you have an excise tax per pack, if you sell less packs, so what. You have accomplished your objective. You have done it. 
This is the worst method to tax we have ever imposed in the Federal Government that I can find. This is so convoluted, so distorted, so deceptive, so contrived say we are raising taxes $1.10 and not do it. If our colleagues want to be honest, they would say let's scrap all this and let's make the tax $1.10, and then you have an automatic volume adjustment. You have an automatic volume adjustment. Because if you purchase less, then that will happen. 
Let me just mention, too, the volume adjustment section, just for my colleagues'----

Mr. NICKLES. I really don't want to. I have a lot to go through and I want to finish this. I am this far and I have a lot more to go. So I will be happy to talk to you in just a minute. But I want to run through several things, and I don't want to get too bogged down on that one particular thing. 
Mr. President, let me just touch on a few other things. And I mention that, Mr. President, and I will guarantee you that not one Member, maybe not any Member, certainly not more than two members of the Commerce Committee or the Finance Committee knew anything about that change in the volume adjustment, and it is a big change. It is different than the committee reported bill. And, again, I am troubled by these games. I am troubled by people saying, oh, here is what the bill says and then to play games maybe late at night, Sunday night, Monday night, and have this bill written by the administration. This is not a Commerce Committee bill. This is an administration bill. 
I think it cries out for change, and the change should be this, I tell my colleagues. The change should be to call a tax a tax. Senator Lautenberg introduced a bill that said let's have a $1.50 tax. That is what the Finance Committee passed. Whatever the tax is, whether it is a $1.10 or $1.50, whatever, we should pass the tax increase per pack plain, simple, clean, and not play this game of, industry, you pay in all these hundreds of billions of dollars, and maybe we will give you some reductions if consumption comes down, but we are going to have penalties if X, Y, Z brand doesn't go down as much as we think it should go down among certain people. 
That is absurd, and that is what we have, all based on polling that they deem to be accurate. That makes no sense, no sense whatsoever. 
Let me go on through a few other points. I am going to try to speed the pace up. There are tobacco distributor licensing fees, brand new; there are nonpayment penalties, there are document good-faith payment penalties; there are antismuggling penalties; and then we get into new spending. So all this is on the revenue side. This is on the tax side. This humongous tax bill, I don't care what period you are looking at, this is a bigger tax bill--gross, net, any figure you want to use--a bigger tax increase than the tax cut we passed last year. Maybe that will help put it in perspective. 
Last year, in a bipartisan manner, we passed $500 tax credit per child. This year, for 1997 it is $400. We passed that. We reduced capital gains from 28 percent to 20 percent. That is one of the reasons you have seen Federal revenues grow by over 10 percent this year. It is because we cut capital gains. People like that. People have more financial transactions, and you are not taxing those transactions so much. It raised a lot of money for the Government. We reduced estate taxes by increasing the exemption. We provided IRAs. We did a lot of good things in the tax bill, a lot of good things. 
Guess what, this tax increase overshadows it. This tax increase overshadows it, and it is paid for, the strong majority of this is paid for, by individuals making less than $30,000, $40,000 a year. This is a tax increase on low-income people. It is a humongous tax increase. It is bigger than all the tax cuts we gave last year, than all the tax cuts. So that should concern people. 
My colleague, Senator Gorton of Washington, said we should have some tax relief. We are going to have a humongous tax increase; we should have some relief. 
We are getting to the spending side now. This is one of the problems that bothered me. I told my colleagues from the outset, I will work to pass a good bill to reduce teenage consumption of drugs and tobacco. I will. I will not support passing a bill that spends hundreds of billions of dollars so government can grow. We grow government in this bill like there is no tomorrow. This bill has government growing from the State level, government growing from the Federal level, government growing at almost any excuse. And the administration wrote every bit of it. 
Did they consult the Appropriations Committee? Did they consult the Budget Committee? No way. We made a little improvement. In the bill that passed the Commerce Committee, this was all off budget and it wasn't subject to an appropriation. All of that was an entitlement. We changed it. Now, only half of it is entitlement. The States are entitled to 40 percent. That is an entitlement. We can't touch that. And then the farmers are entitled--under the bill from the administration and Commerce Committee, farmers are entitled to $28 billion. 
I know Senator Lugar is going to have an amendment to reduce that, but in both cases those are entitlements. In both cases we are spending billions of dollars. I have a problem with that. I don't know how I can go to my farmers and say those tobacco farmers are going to be entitled to get maybe $18,000 an acre on this buy-out, and of course they can continue producing tobacco after we buy them out. We will buy their quota, but, yes, they can continue producing tobacco forever. I have trouble with that. 
I have trouble with, Who is going to get most of this money? Let's see; let's figure out who is going to get the money. I mentioned my mother had emphysema and lung cancer. Does she get any money? No. Do victims get any money? No. Government gets money. Who gets money? Do victims of cancer and smoking-related disease and problems get money of out of this? No. Who gets the money? States get the money. The Government gets the money. 
Where are they going to use the money? The bill says the States get 40 percent of the money, and they are going to get at least $196 billion so they don't sue the tobacco companies. Four 
have done it and settled. More power to them. Congratulations. 
Who is going to benefit from that? I guess the States do. They get some money. In the State of Florida, out of an $11.3 billion, the trial attorneys get $2.8 billion. That is 24.7 percent. In Texas, they had a $15.3 billion deal; the trial attorneys get $2.2 billion. 
We had an amendment the other day to limit it. Maybe it was too low. I am going to tell my colleagues, you are going to have another chance. But we are going to give a few individuals, maybe 50 individuals or something, we are going to make them multimillionaires, maybe billionaires? We have had some of these people working the halls of Congress. These guys, some of them have chances to become billionaires, with a `b.' 
And I am all for people making money, I think that is great, but we should not do it raising taxes on consumers making under $25,000. We are getting ready to do it, and I will tell my colleagues, if we pass this and if somehow you are successful--and I don't think you will be--but if some forsaken way you are successful getting this through conference the way you have it set up right now, you will be more than embarrassed. You will be reading about individuals making hundreds of millions of dollars, trial attorneys making hundreds of millions of dollars off this deal. And you had your hands on it? I would be embarrassed, and I think that you would. I think we are going to fix it. 
I noticed the Senator from North Carolina was here, and he tried to fix it with one amendment. It didn't pass, but my guess is we have some other ideas. I think we will fix it before it leaves the Senate. If we don't fix it before it leaves the Senate, we will fix it in conference. If we don't fix it in conference, I hope we don't have a bill. I hope we don't have a bill anything like this. And, again, I reiterate my position, I think we can come up with a bill that will be good to curb teenage smoking and consumption of drugs and tobacco. But I do not think we have to come up with a scheme that spends either $500 billion or $755 billion or $885 billion. I don't think we have to do it. I know we don't have to do it. 
Some people are saying, `I am reading a poll and'--I don't care what the poll says. Let's do what is right. Let us try to curb teen smoking. You don't have to do all of this. 
The FDA came up with their regulations 2 years ago, and they said their regs alone were going to reduce consumption by 50 percent. There is not a lot of difference between 50 percent and 60 percent, except I see hundreds of billions of dollars being spent in the process. So, let me talk about that. I talked a little bit about the money going in. I am telling you, there is a lot more money going in than people have mentioned. If they say there is only a dollar and a dime, let's pass an amendment and say here's a dollar and a dime, and I guarantee these figures will shrink. They will shrink.

Mr. NICKLES. No, I won't yield. I am going to continue or I will never get done, and then I will be happy to yield for a question. 
The spending side of this equation, I mentioned it has a couple of entitlements. The States get 40 percent of revenues. We tell the States: You have to spend half of it as the Clinton administration decreed. You have to spend half as they said. It must be on children's health, child care, child welfare, substance abuse, education, children's health insurance--any of their little social programs that they like. Granted, the Clinton administration wants to expand the welfare state. So they say, here, States, we know that you initiated these lawsuits and you were winning some of them, but, since now we are going to take this over and federalize it, you have to spend the money the way we want. 
So the bill restricts half of the state money and says: States, you spend it in a welfare-acceptable or child-acceptable manner as the Clinton administration dictates that it be spent. And then they say: States, you can spend the other half any way you want to. So that is the way we are going to increase government in the States. States, congratulations, here's your money. In exchange for that, we are going to limit your ability to sue the tobacco companies. 
I can see why the companies walked away from this deal. They made a deal with the Clinton administration and the administration broke it, and they can still be sued in lots of areas. Oh, well, there is an $8 billion cap. I can see a race to the courthouse. 
I am going to support the amendment of the Senator from New Hampshire to strike protections for the tobacco companies. Some people say, if you are opposed to this bill, Senator Nickles, you must be in favor of the tobacco companies. This bill does the tobacco companies a big favor by limiting their liability to $8 billion a year. The tobacco companies are saying they are not even part of it. Why should we give them an $8 billion limit of liability? Why? 
I don't see any reason to do that. I agree with the Senator from New Hampshire. So I am not going to give the tobacco companies the protection they really want. Why give it to them? It is the proponents of the bill who are trying to do the tobacco companies a big favor, not some of the opponents.

Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, what about the money? Now we are talking about money. The States are going to get 40 percent of this amount, and they can spend half as they want, and the other half is spent as the Clinton administration wants. 
They can spend it on public health--and we are all for public health. That is going to get 22 percent. So we are going to grow a lot of government in that area. Health-related research, we are all for that. Farmers' assistance, we are going to make farmers millionaires. Maybe these farmers were thinking about selling their property last week. Now, they hear Congress is getting ready to pass a bill and they say, `I might get 4, 5, 10 times what the property is worth if I hang around.' It would be interesting to see what is happening on tobacco farm prices right now in North Carolina, Kentucky, Virginia and other places, because Congress is going to pay them billions of dollars. 
We are going to pay them so much--not per acre--per pound of quota, and we are going to make a lot of them a lot wealthier than they have ever been. 
Guess what? When we are done paying them they can still grow tobacco. We can buy their farms cheaper than what will be paid under these two proposals right now. We can buy the land, have the Government take over the land and turn it into a park. I shouldn't say that out loud, because somebody is going to propose it. 
We are going to make people very, very wealthy because they hold a document called an allotment. It goes back to the New Deal. If you believe in free markets, it is just totally wrong. Yet, we are going to compensate them; we are going to buy them out. 
Let me go through some other new spending provisions. 
There is a Medicare preservation account. Frankly, that is important, but I tell my colleagues, it wasn't in the Commerce Committee bill. It wasn't in the Finance Committee bill. It appeared Sunday or Monday night, and I object to that. I object to the administration coming in and saying, `Oh, we have some new ideas here,' as they did with their volume adjustment. 
We have child care development block grants. This is very interesting. This was put in the Commerce Committee bill, and I objected to it. One, they don't have jurisdiction over child care development block grants, but they were putting it in anyway. They are not the committee of jurisdiction on that. I don't know if they know anything about it. They put the money in. The Finance Committee took it out. Guess what? The Clinton administration put it back in. I am troubled by that. 
Then, I find they did some other things. They changed formulas for child care programs. I wonder if my colleague from North Dakota knows that. They changed the formula. We have a State match formula for Medicaid. The match in most States is 50-50. In some States, it is 70-30. This bill now reduces that State match for child care to 20 percent, because they want more child care money spent and more individuals to qualify for it. The States actually have more money now in this program than they know what to do with. People were not taking advantage of it, so they reduced the State participation down to 20 percent. 
The Federal Government for child care, with this increase, is going to pay four times as much as the State pays for it. That is an entitlement. That is a change, and the Commerce Committee has no jurisdiction over that. They did it. They also have report language that says, `Hey, let's spend about $4 billion per year on this program.' This is a 25-year bill. That is $100 billion. It was just added. Does anybody know it? Like I said, it was in, it was out, now it is back in. 
They changed the Medicaid provision, which is wrong. They put in a brand new children's health care provision, which basically 
reopened the welfare bill. The bill would add $25 billion for States to do Medicaid outreach on children's care. We debated welfare. We passed the welfare reform bill. Now, the administration is coming through the backdoor on the tobacco bill saying, `Let's expand the welfare bill.' 
They did it in the middle of the night. It did not pass the Commerce Committee. They didn't ask anybody in the Finance Committee who worked on welfare reform--not one person, not staff, not anybody. They just put it in. 
They also put in a provision that allows for presumptive eligibility outside the cap funding for children's health care. Last year, we passed children's health care, a $24 billion. We increased cigarette taxes to do it. I thought it was too much. I didn't support it, but we passed it. It is now the law of the land. 
Guess what they did in this bill? They just put in this new language. It was not in the Commerce Committee bill. It was not in the Finance Committee bill. The administration put it in. It sickens me to know that the administration thinks they have the ability to rewrite this bill. It may have Senator McCain's name on it, but it is the administration's bill. Now, they are opening up the welfare bill, and they are opening up the kid care bill we passed last year for a massive expansion. These new provisions are estimated to cost $400 million per year. They open up the balanced budget agreement. That was part of our balanced budget agreement package that we negotiated and fought so hard for. Again, they cannot find enough people to qualify for the money under the language that we already have, so they are trying to figure out new ways to spend more money. 
We have new programs for cessation and other treatments, Indian Health Service, education prevention, counterads, which incidentally, I will support. This paltry bill is spending hundreds of billions of dollars. Do you know what it spends for countereducational ads to discourage the consumption of tobacco? Mr. President, $500 million a year. Big deal. 
Everybody says, `Hey, we need to pass this bill so we can reduce teen consumption of tobacco.' So $500 million out of a total of about $20 billion dollars almost every year. All the rest is for other Government spending; in some cases, any Government spending. 
The national educational effort to convince people that smoking can bring about cancer is pretty small out of this total package. 
It has an Institute of Medicine study, National Institutes of Health--all of these are getting pro rata shares of money that would be authorized--Centers for Disease Control, National Science Foundation, National Cancer Clinical Trials. That program wasn't in anybody's bill. The administration put that in either Sunday or Monday. They have money in here for a State retail licensing program, State grants, of $200 million a year. It is on page 118 of the bill. 
I will just tell my colleagues what this does. I am embarrassed that we would put language in that allows this to happen. But I want my colleagues at least to know it so that maybe they will agree with me. I will have an amendment at some point to strike some of this language. 
The State retail licensing program codifies that portion of the FDA regulations. It provides for $200 million a year and, basically, it codifies the FDA regulations dealing with selling tobacco. That is on page 119. It says:  
Shall prohibit retailers from selling or otherwise distributing tobacco products to individuals under 18 years of age, in accordance with the Youth Access Restrictions regulations promulgated by the Secretary. 
Let me mention what that one little paragraph does. That paragraph says we are going to set up a whole mechanism to find out whether or not retail establishments are selling tobacco to teenagers. Maybe you say, `Hey, I don't want retail establishments selling to teenagers.' So how are they going to do it? There is $200 million which they give to the States in block grants. The States have to contract to set up inspection teams to do random inspections across the country to find out whether or not they are complying. 
What if they don't comply? The fines and penalties are very, very significant. 
I looked it up. The fifth noncompliance the penalty is $10,000. For the sixth there is an even greater penalty; it is not just monetary. 
So the Federal Government is going to train these inspectors. They are going to go out and do random audits. And I just have to think, what are we doing? How far are we going in this Government police business? In the committee reported bill there would have been so many inspections per State. Each individual State had a list of how many inspections. I will talk about this later, because I plan on having an amendment on it. But I say on the floor today, I believe, there have to be 4,000 inspections--smaller States less, bigger States more. 
The bill was mandating thousands of inspections where these people would be going by and seeing if somebody is purchasing cigarettes. Guess what? It is not just purchasing under age 18; they are checking to see if the establishment is checking IDs for people up to age 27. So you are in noncompliance if you are a gas station and you sell cigarettes to somebody who is 26 years old. That is a violation if you do not check their ID. You are in violation of these Federal regulations if you do not check their ID. 
Now, I am going to have a different speech talking about FDA regulations. But my point is, this bill sets up a $200 million new program to give money to the States. The States monitor this as we deem appropriate on the Federal level. I find that to be absurd. And the Federal Government, with its wisdom, says, `We believe you should check everybody aged 27 or less. If you don't check them, you are subject to fines of up to $10,000.' 
Wow. Now, think of that. You have some burly Marine who is 25 years old from the Marine camp in North Carolina who comes in, and he says he wants a pack of cigarettes, and you can tell he is more than 18 years old. And you are going to ask this guy, `Oh, I can tell you're a sergeant major, but we want to check your ID"? I don't want to ask him to do that. But you could be fined up to $10,000. That is in the FDA reg. 
We are getting ready to codify the FDA regs. We are getting ready to deem the FDA regs as law, which is a very bad idea. The FDA can come up with regs. They cannot write law. They cannot write law. Their regs, in my opinion, are unconstitutional. We just cannot deem something unconstitutional as law, as this bill would propose to do, whether it be in advertising or otherwise. Just to give you an example, the FDA regs said it was unlawful for tobacco companies to develop advertising gimmicks such as a hat. I have a staff member who has a hat that says `Marlboro' on it. Heaven forbid, what outlandish behavior. We have the Federal Government saying, `You can't have a hat that has `Marlboro' on it or `Winston'? Give me a break. And there are penalties for noncompliance with that. 
The FDA came up with some outlandish regulations. We are just going to deem those regulations as law? We are the legislative body. I think we should clarify what FDA can do. I don't mind regulating nicotine. I do not mind giving FDA some additional authority if we clearly define it, but Congress should define it. We should not just take their regs and say, `Here. Whatever you've said is fine. It's law, no matter what court cases are already decided.' Wait a minute. If they went too far, they breached the Constitution, we are just going to deem it as law? That is not good legislation. That is just doing whatever FDA wants. 
Again, this administration wrote the bill. But we should not adopt those provisions. We are the legislative branch. We are the equal branch of the administration. Why let them write this bill? Why help them pass a bill which has no tax relief, spends hundreds of billions of dollars, and its impact on smoking is very questionable?

Mr. NICKLES. There is a Scientific Advisory Committee, there is a National Tobacco Free Education Advisory Board. That concludes this list. And we haven't found them all yet. Since we also added the Lugar amendment, there are several provisions, some of which are similar but not near as extensive or as expensive as that provided in the Commerce Committee bill. It adds a tobacco community's revitalization trust fund, it adds a tobacco quota buyout, block grants, tobacco farmer assessment, and so on. 
I want to be fair on both sides of the tobacco argument. You add all that together, you have 30-some new programs funded in this bill. You have hundreds of billions of dollars funded in this bill. You have trial attorneys who, in all likelihood, will make over $100 billion out of this bill--$100 billion out of this bill.

Mr. NICKLES. Now, are we going to pass that? I know I saw an ad by Dr. Koop saying we need to. I love Dr. Koop. I know he is very sincere. But I don't think you have to spend hundreds of billions of dollars to go after teenage consumption of tobacco or of drugs. And I think we should go after both. I think we would be grossly irresponsible if we don't go after both. 
I am concerned about the cost of this bill. I told my friend and colleague from Arizona that I have the greatest respect for him but I don't have great respect for this bill. I think this bill is one of the worst pieces of legislation that Congress has considered since the health care dictates of the President and Mrs. Clinton several years ago. That bothers me. I don't think we should pass it in the Senate. I told my colleagues I am not going to just stand back and throw rocks at it. I will try to make some improvements. 
I read a list of the sections, and I don't think there should be an asbestos section. I may have an amendment to delete it. I don't think we should have the massive industry payment system. I am going to try to talk my colleagues into replacing it with a simple excise tax. Raise it $1.10, so you know exactly the amount. I am not comfortable with the fact that some people are saying it is $1.10, but it raises more money than that, so maybe they will have more money to spend. There is no doubt in my mind that these payments, and you divide that out by the number of cigarettes sold, if you are selling 24 billion cigarettes, you realize this will raise a lot more money than $1.10. We are talking about big money. We are talking about it every year. 
The tobacco settlement was originally, when fully implemented, about $15 billion a year. This bill starts at $24 billion, and by the year 2002, assuming the kickback comes in, $30 billion. That is a lot of money--3,000 percent increase in the tax on smokeless tobacco and so on. 
Maybe people don't care. I care. I care about the procedure. I think some of my colleagues from the tobacco areas were upset about the procedure. I think when you are dealing with the agriculture section, that should have come out of the Agriculture Committee. Commerce Committee is not supposed to write the agriculture section. And Commerce Committee is not supposed to write the tax section. And they did both and they did a crummy job on the tax section. This is the worst tax law I've seen. If we pass it, it would be the worst tax bill Congress has passed. With all due respect, it wasn't even done by the Commerce Committee. It was done by the administration. President Clinton didn't want to use the word `tax' so he thinks they hide it by using the word `fee,' but it is not a voluntary fee. 
If tobacco companies were in agreement with this, this would be voluntary, it would be a fee, and in return they get some liability protection, and that is what they negotiated with the attorneys general. Maybe that would work. This is not voluntary. There is no provision that says if the tobacco companies don't like the fee, they don't have to pay it. There is no provision like that. So it is a tax. Congress has the power to tax, but if we are going to tax, let's tax right. 
The cigarette excise tax right now is 24 cents per pack. It is going to 39 cents by 2002. This bill purports to raise it another $1.10, so that goes to $1.49. 
So for my colleagues who are trying to push the tax to $1.50, it will be $1.10 by the year 2002 under this bill, plus indexed for inflation. So maybe you have a lot more than you really realized. 
Let me take you through the numbers again. The tax on cigarettes today is 24 cents per pack. Congress, last year, I believe, increased that tax 15 cents--24 and 15 is 39 cents. That is already law. This bill adds to that, purportedly, another $1.10. A $1.10 on top of the 39 cents is $1.49. So the Federal excise tax on tobacco, at a minimum, will be $1.49 in the year 2002, plus it is indexed for inflation forever. This is indexed at inflation, or 3 percent--whichever is greater. Never had an 
index that I know like that. I don't know that that makes sense, but we have it in there. Why do we have it in there? So we put more money in the pot so we have more money to spend. I don't think we should do that. 
What should we do? We should work together to come up with a responsible package. I am willing to do that. I think this bill goes way too far. 
I haven't touched the regulatory side of the bill. I will save that for another speech, and hopefully maybe the FDA section will have some common sense come into it. We don't want to give this unbridled authority to the administration. Don't we want to preserve for ourselves, the legislative branch, the authority to write law? Or are we going to take a massive menu of FDA regs and say they are deemed to be law, although a court said part of them is unconstitutional. I don't think we should do that. I will save the FDA section for another comment and another time. 
Now I am talking primarily about the financial impact of this bill. Let's work on a bill that will do a couple of things. Let s work on a bill that will try to educate youngsters that using drugs or using tobacco is a very serious problem. Let's try to reverse this trend that happened, frankly, in the last 6 years, during the Clinton administration, where marijuana use doubled among high school seniors, where tobacco use is up 35 percent among high school seniors. Let's try to reverse that through some public education. Let's try to get some workable restrictions that are constitutional. Let's try to put some responsibility back on young people. Let's try to maybe give the States the encouragement to enforce the law. 
It is against the law in every State in the Nation for people under the age of 18 to smoke. So if they enforce the law, we don't have this problem. Now, maybe they are not enforcing the law. But certainly this little operation we have here where we are going to have the Federal Government spend $200 million a year to go around and have all these people inspecting to see if the convenience stores are checking IDs up to people age 27 is absurd. That is not going to work. It will build resentment. We need to say, States, what can you do to enforce the law? Maybe all the enforcement should go not to just the person selling the tobacco product. I am all for the States, if they find somebody selling tobacco or alcohol, frankly, to that minor, there should be significant penalties. That is the reason the laws are on the book. They should enforce the law. The penalties should not be just on the person selling but on the person buying or the person consuming. There are laws if you are driving under the influence, you get a DUI, they can take your license away. Maybe we should have restrictions and penalties on the consumer if they are breaking the tobacco consumption laws. Maybe it would be a financial penalty, maybe it would be that they have to do community service. Maybe they have to clean up a park. Give the States some flexibility to put some penalties on the consumer. 
One of the reasons I didn't smoke is because I had a football coach who said, you smoke, you are out of here. Everybody else in our group understood that there was a penalty, there would be a price to be paid. So let's put it back on the individual. Let's turn it around. We can do some things like that. 
What I see here is a massive effort to conceal, disguise, slide in under the radar screen, a very big tax price increase. And the way it is done is going to have minimal impact on reducing consumption among teenagers because we slide it in stealthily. It starts at 65 cents and over 5 years it is $1.10, according to this nonsense. Are we going to do it so gradually there is no sticker shock, so there won't be any impact anyway? The Finance Committee said, if you are going to increase the tax, put it up front, 
that, to me, is at least more honest. Do a tax, do away with the nonsense of hundreds of billions of dollars in industry payments. The tax is 24 cents now, so it's going to 39 cents. If Congress has the votes to do it, make it another dollar, add it on, vote on it. I probably won't vote for it. But do it honestly. The way we have here is so misleading and deceptive. 
Instead we are going to talk about volume reductions, and we are going to talk about inflation adjustment and about these payments, and I am going to bring up the point that some companies don't have to pay. If smokeless companies produce less than 1 percent, they are exempt. So what are we going to do? We are going to put penalties, big assessments on some companies; but a new startup company doesn't have to pay this $1.10 assessment. That is a big advantage. I have a feeling that this bill is going to cause new companies to crop up all over the place. 
I think the arguments made by the Senator from Utah and others about having a black market are very real. These commodities aren't that hard to smuggle or hide. I think if you put in this kind of incentive, you will have the same thing happen as it did in Canada and in other countries in Europe. You are going to find a lot of contraband, a lot of hidden stuff, and people smuggling tobacco like they used to be smuggling liquor. There is a lot of money to be made in the process. If they are smuggling tobacco tax free, there is money to be made. And there is money to be made in drugs. Smuggling under this bill is illegal. But the financial rewards will be very lucrative. If a person figures out the value of a truckload of cigarettes, you will realize that there is a real incentive if a person can get around the law and paying these taxes. The taxes are going to be greater, certainly, than the product. 
I stopped in a gas station last weekend just to see what tobacco prices were. I didn't know; I don't buy tobacco. There were some cigarettes selling for $1.24 a pack, and another for $1.84, and another for $2.02. People say most of them are about $2. The more popular brands were the higher-priced ones, closer to $2. That is with the tobacco tax of 24 cents. If it goes up another 15 cents--this bill purports to take it up to $1.10, and that is without the look-back penalties. If you add that back in, you are looking at probably close to a $2-per-pack tax that is in this bill. So taking a product right now that sells from $1.24 to $2, you are going to add $1.50 to $2 in taxes very shortly on consumers. Is that going to be an incentive for people to smuggle cigarettes and get around the law? I believe it is. Certainly, there is incentive. I hope they won't be successful. I don't want to set up a black market or encourage that type of activity, but I am afraid we will be doing it. 
Finally, Mr. President, let me just say that I am disgusted about the procedure. I don't say that very often. I am part of the leadership, but I am disgusted by the fact that you have one committee, the Commerce Committee, writing the finance portion, writing the agriculture portion, and they didn't do a very good job. I am disgusted by the fact that the bill changed and the administration rewrote the bill over the weekend. They didn't consult the Commerce Committee, or the Finance Committee, or the committees of jurisdiction dealing with welfare, child care, the committees that wrote those laws, people that had the staff and the experts who knew what they were talking about. The administration put in a lot of their wish lists. I am disgusted by the fact that we would set up a whole new trust fund and say it is limited to $1.10 tax, when it is not. 
Let's be honest with people. This is not the way to pass legislation. The Commerce Committee is not a tax-writing committee. They did a crummy job. I am disgusted. The tax on one can of Skoal will be one level, and on a competitor it would be 30 percent less. I am disgusted by the fact that one cigarette company is not going to have the excise tax that another cigarette company is going to have. Wait a minute, this is a national excise tax, but some companies don't have to pay it and some companies do. 
That is not the way you do business. I don't care if you are small or large. Excise taxes are supposed to be across the board. They didn't do that. 
I am also disgusted by the fact that we would end up passing a bill to allow trial attorneys to make $100 billion over the life of this bill--probably $4 billion a year over the course of this bill. That bothers me a lot. That reminds me of what motivates this bill and it reminds me of the movie `Jerry McGuire,' where someone is screaming, `Show me the money.' That is what is driving this thing. It is not just about curbing teenage smoking. That is a great public relations campaign, and I will stand with anybody to try to curb teenage smoking and drug use. I emphasize `drug use,' because there is silence in this bill about that. We are not going to pass a bill, if I have anything to do with it, unless we have a significant effort to combat not just cigarettes but also marijuana and other illegal drugs that are much more hazardous, dangerous, and deadly. 
I think this bill needs a lot of work. My guess is that it is probably not fixable with just a few amendments. I don't think we should be in a real rush to pass it. I have spent the last three nights staying up past 1 o'clock reading this bill, trying to understand how it works. I still have a lot to learn about this bill. Before we pass the biggest tax increase, the biggest spending program considered by Congress in years, I think we ought to know a little bit more about it. So I urge colleagues to do their homework, consider serious amendments, not frivolous amendments to string this bill out for a long time, but to make it better. 
We are legislators. We are trying to pass law. My opinion is that this is a bad bill that needs to be improved significantly before we let it become law. I will reiterate my statement that I will work with any colleague, Democrat or Republican, to try to fashion a bill that will reduce teenage consumption of drugs and tobacco. But I don't think we have to spend hundreds of billions of dollars to do it. I don't think we have to turn over massive amounts of power to bureaucrats to do it. So I look forward to working with my colleagues to try to make that happen in the next few weeks as we consider this legislation. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, my colleague is making my argument for me. 
In the first place, I am consistent. The administration, and Senator McCain, said this bill would only cost $516 billion. Guess what? They don't make a volume adjustment on that estimate. Instead, they used constant 1999 dollars. 
I have a letter from OMB that was trying to refute my argument, but basically they made it for me. OMB says inflated nominal dollar industry payments would equal $755 billion over 25 years. That is without the look-back penalty. By way of comparison, the equivalent estimate which the State attorneys general are proposing is $539 billion in nominal dollars. Like the private analysis, these estimates do not included volume adjustments. There is a reason they do not include volume adjustments. It is because it is hard to figure. 
My point is that everybody here has heard the attorneys general group discussing the $368 billion figure that the administration signed off on. When they use the $368 billion, they do not take into account any volume adjustment. No one knows what the volume adjustment is going to be.

Mr. NICKLES. I understand; no problem. I bragged on the Senator before. 
But I want to talk a little bit about the volume adjustment. I am very familiar with the volume adjustment because I have been trying to figure out what they are doing with it. 
Also the Senator from North Dakota tried to repudiate my number of $755 billion. I am telling you that is the same number OMB came up with, and they didn't volume adjust it, and they didn't volume adjust the $368 billion. 
I want people to know that I am consistent with what was done before. 
In addition to inflation, the bill that was reported out of the Commerce Committee was to have a volume adjustment. If you sell less, there would be less tax. So you have some reduction. But they do not know exactly what that would be. 
What was rewritten by the administration on Sunday or Monday is that there will be a volume adjustment if and when volume gets less than 80 percent of last year's level. That is a big change. 
Under the bill as originally written, the volume adjustments don't kick in until the sixth year. Then you would have some reduction. They say you will get a reduction if and when you reduce consumption below 80 percent down here. 
My point is there is no volume reduction for the first several years, and after that you are guessing. But the volume reduction must be lower than 80 percent. To get any volume reduction whatsoever, you must reduce consumption total by more than 20 percent. It used to be that you only had to reduce it 1 percent to get a 1-percent reduction. Now, you have to reduce 21 percent to get a 1-percent reduction. It may be that they will never get a volume reduction as a result of that change. I don't know. 
But my point being is that, one, we are being consistent in our analysis of the cost of the bill, as it pertains to OMB, as it pertains to the Attorney General. 
I want people to know what the facts are. The fact is the bill says it has a CPI adjustment. The facts are that OMB said they used constant 1999 dollars to get $516 billion. I read it in the committee report. This is absurd. It said total payments shall not exceed $516 billion. That is not in the bill. It doesn't fit. It doesn't work. 
If you use nominal dollars, as we use in every other budget projection, and you put a 3-percent kicker in, that is how you get up to $755 billion. 
Then you can add the look-back assessment. One could say there will not be a look-back. Why was all this effort to add a look-back. I heard colleagues say on the floor that look-back is almost maybe 50 cents. I will tell you the look-back is a disaster. If anybody wants to raise tobacco prices another 50 cents, do it honestly. The look-back rests on the Secretary of Treasury taking a poll and saying, `Did we meet our objectives? We want to reduce consumption by teenagers by a certain percentage. Did we make it? If we didn't make it, what happens then?' If they miss it by a certain percent, there is a fine. If they miss it by a bigger percent, there is a bigger fine. That raises about $4 billion. 
Then, they go to brand specific look-back assessments. This is absurd. They say they are going to, in the same poll, find out whether these youngsters buy X, Y, or Z brand. And if they smoke that brand, and that brand does not meet that target, there is a $1,000 penalty. For every teenager they identify that smoked more cigarettes in that particular percentage, then there is a $1,000 fine. 
That is not really workable, and it needs to be fixed. It needs to be cleaned up. It needs to be deleted and then raise the tax whatever you want to raise it. Be honest. Tell people we want to raise taxes. The first year it is going to a dollar a pack. Just raise it a dollar a pack. Say next year, instead of 24 cents, it is going to be $1.24. Just do it. That would be the honest way. This thing is more than deceptive and, in my opinion, probably won't work. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. NICKLES. I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a Joint Tax report. 
Now, first I want to reply to my colleague. This joint tax report, which I have been asking for every day, is dated May 20, yesterday. They didn't have this information before. No one has had a chart on what they thought the industry adjustment would be, but let me just give the facts according to Joint Tax if you worship at that altar. 
In the first place, they say the figures I have on the gross industry payments, are accurate. They have the exact same figures that I have. They happen to be accurate. They estimate these for the first time. We don't have a CBO study. We don't have a GAO study. We don't have anything from the administration showing what they think the volume adjustment would be. No one has had volume adjustments in any of their charts, because it is a guess. But let me just repeat what the Joint Tax Committee has said. They say the gross figures that I have are identical. They say the total tax on consumers over the first 5 years is $102 billion. They say volume adjustment is $8.7 billion. So the net over the 5 years is $93.4 billion. 
So this massive change in numbers that you are talking about is not that massive. The total amount of tax on tobacco consumers, according to joint tax, over five years is $93.4 billion. That is pretty significant. 
So, Mr. President, I just got this yesterday, or maybe we got it today. We got it today. And I am happy to have it submitted for the Record. I am happy to debate facts all day long, and I want to debate facts. 
I see my colleague from Vermont who supports, I believe, a straight excise tax. I just think you ought to do a tax. I think this scheme of having industry payments and having look-backs and surveys and polls, and those polls are deemed to be accurate--that is absurd, but that is what is in this bill. 
You have an automatic volume reduction if you have an honest excise tax. Isn't that the truth? If you have an honest excise tax of $1.10 and there is less cigarettes sold, there will be less money going in to the trust fund. It is self-fulfilling if you do it right. 
This bill does it wrong. This bill says we are going to have this formula for this money to go in, and it is indexed and there is additional formulas if we determine a certain number of people are using the wrong product. And so we will put that in. And then, oh, yes, we will reduce it by volume if we determine that. 
Why not just have a tax per pack, and if there is less volume, there will be less money going into the pot. And no one will have to argue about volume adjustment that will be determined by the Secretary to send to these various companies, and, oh, he is going to forget to send that assessment to some companies. 
That doesn't make sense. If somebody makes a different size of Skoal or a different size of snuff, he has a little different tax. You should put the same tax on every pack of cigarettes, the same tax on every brand of moist tobacco or every brand of smokeless tobacco and just do it. And then you have an automatic volume adjustment.

<TEXT>
Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I had printed in the Record this Joint Tax table. I also want to clarify a statement. I said, all of this money would be going into the trust fund. That was the way it was designed as it passed the Commerce Committee initially. The Commerce Committee now says the net revenues from this large payment goes into the trust fund. This chart says `Industry Payments.' That is not correct. It is consumers' payments. Consumers are going to be paying every dime of this tax. 
Granted, they have a section in here that says industry, companies, you pay this amount. But they also have a section in here, on page 189, that says the tobacco companies must pass the cost on to consumers. 
. . . an amount sufficient to pass through to each purchaser on a per-unit basis an equal share of the annual payments to be made by such tobacco product manufacturer. . . . 
In other words, consumers, you have to pay every dime of this, every single dime. This is not paid for by tobacco companies. This is not a tax on tobacco companies. This is a tax on consumers. The way to solve this ambiguity on volume adjustments is just say: `Here is the tax per pack, or per can or whatever it is. And then, if volume goes down, there is less money.' We do not do that in this bill. 
I just mention, too, there is something really phony going on here. Joint Tax--and maybe I am not being as respectful to Joint Tax as I should be. But the way they scored this thing, as I know my colleague knows, they take 25 percent of the revenue from excise taxes and assume that is lost in transmission. So, if you raise $1 in tax, they assume only 75 cents gets to where you are trying to send it. That would usually be correct. If you were going to increase excise taxes on a farmer, he is going to have less money to spend on other products, it is going to slow the economy, so there would be some decline. 
This assumption, I don't think, is applicable to these tobacco payments. Maybe the government would lose some percentage, but I don't think it would be as much as 25 percent. And the reason is the companies, by this language, are forced, mandated, to pass on every dime of this payment. I cannot think of any other business--if Nickles Machine Corporation I used to run, if we had an increase in excise tax, granted that might be in our cost of manufacturer. I might try to pass it on in higher prices to consumers and so on. Maybe I would be successful and maybe I wouldn't. Maybe I'd have to eat part of it. 
We have language in here saying we don't want tobacco companies to pay a dime of this. We want consumers to pay every single dime of this part. Not the look-back. The look-back, they say, is not deductible, so maybe they are supposed to chew on part of that. But the big part of it is passed on to consumers. 
So I want to make sure I was accurate. I think I said this money goes into the trust fund. That was not the case. The language now says the net revenues go into the trust fund. And the net amount is really determined by the Secretary of the Treasury. He has a great deal of flexibility, I am afraid, to say, `Oh, well, we think, since this is all passed through, the gross amount could be the net amount.' He could say that this since it is all passed through. 
Maybe I am getting too technical. I just want people to know, when you see estimates from Joint Tax that they agree that this is a $102 billion tax increase over the first 5 years. The look-backs are a question mark. Who knows? But evidently somebody thinks it is real money or they wouldn't be trying to jack up the look-back penalties. 
And then the other variable is the volume adjustment, and no one has had scoring on volume adjustments until today. These are purely assumptions. I put those into the Record. So, if they were accurate, consumers will pay $102 billion, adjusted by 8.7, so 
$93.4 billion over the 5 years. So it reduces it somewhat. 
For that to happen, you have to assume you are going to have volume less than 80 percent of 1997 over that period of time. Who knows? I don't know. But I always want to be factually correct. I may disagree with the colleagues on substance or philosophy or motives or whatever, but I want to be factually correct. And these numbers, I believe, are factually correct. The volume adjustment is speculative and now Joint Tax says it is minus $8 billion. Great. I do not agree with them that there would be such a large loss of revenue from gross to net, because of the language that says 100 percent of it shall be passed on to consumers. This figure, this payment by consumers, is accurate. Consumers, not tobacco companies, will pay the cost of this bill. I think it is too high. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I want to respond to my colleagues who are proposing this amendment. But, first, I would like to make some general comments about the bill to complement some of the comments I made earlier today, some of which were related to a statement from the Joint Tax Committee which I inserted into the Record, the chart that they put together on the net cost of the bill. They have now added a line to their estimate. I want to include that in the Record as well. This is the price per pack of cigarettes under this bill with all these new taxes and surcharges and look-backs. 
I will tell my colleagues that for 1998, the year that we are in right now, before this bill goes into effect, Joint Tax assumes the price of cigarettes is $1.98. They assume for 1999--I want our colleagues to hear this--Joint Tax says the cost of a pack of cigarettes goes up to $2.88, a 90-cent increase. The next year, $3.24; the next year, $3.41; the next year, $3.66; the next year, $3.83; by the year 2004, it is over $4, $4.06 per pack. The next year it is $4.12; the next year, $4.78; by the year 2007, 9 years from now, the price per pack, $4.48. The price today is less than $2. 
This isn't coming from Don Nickles. This came from Joint Tax. I haven't agreed with everything that Joint Tax has done in estimating this bill. But in this estimate, they have added some of the other aspects of the bill, including the look-back.

Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I wish to address the amendment by my friends and colleagues from Illinois, Ohio, and Oregon dealing with increasing the look-back penalties. 
I made a statement earlier today that I think the look-back provision in this bill is one of the most unworkable provisions that anybody could dream up. I say `unworkable.' I don't think it will work. But I would like to maybe bring to my colleagues' attention how they propose that it should work. 
To make the look-back penalties work, they say we are going to empower the Secretary of the Treasury to do a poll. It says to conduct a survey. The survey is on a national basis. They are going to measure the type of tobacco product used in the last 30 days. They are going to conduct this survey with methodology that he determines is appropriate. They are going to identify the name brand that the youngsters use. They are going to be surveying kids. They are going to be surveying people from ages 11 to 17. And they are going to ask them a question: `Did you smoke, and what brand did you use?' Then they are going to put all this information together. I don't think they are going to ask this of every teenager in America. So it is going to be a random survey. 
Then they are going to compare the results of this survey to the mandates in the bill. If we don't meet the targets, or if the consumption of tobacco by teenagers is higher than what this bill says they should be, the tobacco companies are going to be assessed penalties. And the penalties are very large. The penalties in the look-back provision under the negotiated settlement with the attorneys general went up to $2 billion. The penalties that came out of the Commerce Committee were $4 billion--$3.96 billion. 
And then the penalties which were rewritten by the administration and introduced on Monday came out $4.4 billion maximum, and now the amendment that we have in the Chamber says take that to $7.7 billion, and also increase the target rate to 67 percent. 
Why do rates make a difference? Well, for every point you are out of compliance, you are assessed a penalty, and the penalty is large. The penalty for not making the target under the attorneys general negotiated agreement was $80 million per point missed. 
Well, the penalty under this bill is $240 million per point missed. It is three times as large as that proposed under the original settlement. That is just the industry-wide look-back. There is also a segment that applies to the product, and it has a penalty that is $200 million per point missed. 
If this sounds confusing, it is because it is, and it is in this bill. My point is it is not going to work very well. You are telling the Secretary of Treasury to take a poll, and then we are going to deem that this poll is correct. 
Now, all of us have used surveys. We have all had polls. But this bill has language that I guess people want to become law which says the survey using the methodology required by this subsection is deemed conclusively to be proper, correct, and accurate for the purposes of this act. 
So we are saying, whatever the Secretary says, it is accurate. It is a done deal. And then they are going to and ask the kids, did you smoke? Now, they don't ask them, did you smoke 10 times? Did you smoke a pack a day? They can smoke one cigarette during that 30-day period and they are counted. And if this thing worked just right, a tobacco company would have to pay $1,000 because a youngster smoked one cigarette. I find that to be pretty high. And I might mention, this is really supposed to go after young people who are smoking illegally. They are smoking illegally. Let's put the penalty on the young person for breaking the law. Instead, we are going to do a random survey, a random survey that has to determine every single percentage for every single tobacco product. There is a de minimis level. We are not going to hit the smallest companies, I guess. I don't know how many different tobacco products there are. I don't know them very well. I don't smoke. I can only think of three or four cigarette brands. I don't smoke. And my guess is there is probably a lot of teenagers who don't either, but they can remember maybe the biggest name brands. I can remember Marlboro and Winston and maybe Virginia Slims. So if somebody said, do you smoke? I might be able to remember those name brands.

Mr. NICKLES. In a minute. That youngster taking the survey, if they mention a name brand, whether that was the brand they smoked or not, it comes out in the calculation of this data which is deemed accurate, proper, and correct. Then, that company can be subjected to enormous fines. 
In the proposal, in the amendment that we have pending, the fines that are brand specific go up to $5 billion. They are also indexed for inflation. That is a pretty big penalty. 
Then there is a $2.2 billion look-back that applies industry-wide. The Secretary of Treasury takes this survey and tries to determine what percentage of young people are smoking each brand in the country, and if each one of them by brand product missed this target, then they are assessed penalties that can go up to $7.7 billion and even higher in the outyears. 
This is not a good plan. This is not a workable plan. I tell my colleagues, if you want to do something to reduce teenage smoking, come up with something else. If you want to come up with higher taxes, just increase the tax. I have heard some people say you don't need $1.50 because we have a big look-back and it's really $1.50 anyway. If you want to make it a $1.50, make it a $1.50, but call it a tax. Make it clear. Make it honest. This is a scheme. We are going to deem a poll to be accurate, and authorize the 
Secretary to assess enormous penalties, in the billions of dollars. 
That doesn't make sense. Now, if you really want to reduce teen smoking, do something else. Say to teenagers, if you are caught smoking, we are going to slap your wrist. The second time we are going to make you clean up a park, the third time maybe a financial penalty. We don't have that in this bill. And I don't want the Federal Government to do it because I don't want to federalize these actions, but instead we should encourage the States to enforce the law. 
It is against the law for teenagers below the age of 18 to smoke in any State. If you don't want anybody to smoke that is 18 years old, try and increase the age to 20 or 21. You have that right. But to come in----

Mr. NICKLES. And if we want to decrease teenage consumption, maybe we should encourage the States to pass laws it is against the law to consume and put some responsibility back on the individual. Instead, we are allowing this massive growth of government. 
It doesn't make sense. It is not workable. It is not fair. And I don't think it will be effective. I also don't think parts of it will be constitutional, and I don't think we have willing participants by the tobacco companies. So it is just not a good deal. For people who want to raise taxes, raise taxes. Be up front, be honest. If you want to do something else, do something else to get teen consumption down. But this bill is not going to work. It is just not a workable plan. Frankly, if it wouldn't work at $4.4 billion, it won't work at $7.7 billion. 
I urge my colleagues examine this look-back provision, see how complicated it is, see how confusing it is to give the Secretary this power, and to decide this is not the right way to legislate. It is not the right way to tax, and let's come up with something better. I hope something better would include some personal responsibility and accountability for people who are breaking the law. If a teenager purchases, it is against the law if they are under the age of 18. And if you really don't want them to smoke, maybe we should encourage the States to have laws against the consumption as well.

Mr. NICKLES. I will be happy to tell my colleague from Arizona that he makes a good point but he is absolutely wrong. What the industry agreed to, according to the settlement, is that they would pay $80 million per point of noncompliance, up to a total of $2 billion. What we have before us is two surveys, penalties up to $4.4 billion, and an amendment to go to $7.7 billion. 
Does my colleague from Arizona realize there is a difference between $7.7 billion and $2 billion? and that $5.5 of this new penalty is product-specific? and the industry did not agree to a product-specific penalty? These provisions were not in the industry settlement, as I am reading it right now.

Mr. NICKLES. I agree totally. And I also tell my colleague and friend from Texas, I wasn't part of the tobacco companies' deal. I am part of the Finance Committee. And I think if we are going to legislate on taxes, we ought to do it right. This is not the right way to tax. 
I will also tell my colleague from Texas, I have heard people say the tobacco industry is confident they can challenge these look-back assessments and win in court and have it thrown out as unconstitutional. Regardless of the constitutional argument, I say this is a crummy way to tax. I don't want to give the Secretary of the Treasury the authority to conduct a poll and then determine that the poll is accurate, proper, correct for purposes of this act, and be able to make assessments. Under the agreement the tobacco companies agreed to, it was up to $2 billion. Under the bill that came out of the Commerce Committee, it was $3.96 billion. Under the bill the administration wrote and introduced on Monday, it came up to $4.4 billion. And on the amendment we have pending now, it is $7.7 billion, also indexed for inflation. 
The industry did not sign off on any $7.7 billion look-back.

Mr. NICKLES. I got on the Finance Committee because I did not like the way our tax system was structured. I want to work with our colleagues from Mississippi and Texas, to take the Tax Code and rewrite it and come up with something that is fair, flat, and simple. This is tobacco bill just the opposite. This is a mess. We could clean this bill up a lot if we went through the conventional process, if we had the Finance Committee mark up this bill on the tax side and call a tax a tax. 
Instead, we have this unbelievably complicated system, and the look-back is maybe the most complicated. Delegating to the Secretary of the Treasury to take a poll, and then, if they don't meet the targets that we set, we are going to assess them billions of dollars, up to $7 billion or $8 billion, I find to be ludicrous. It doesn't make sense. It is not a good way to legislate. 
That is the reason that the Commerce Committee doesn't have taxation power, in the Senate. In the Senate, the Finance 
Committee has the power to raise taxes.

Mr. NICKLES. I will tell my friend and colleague, the Finance Committee did consider this bill for 24 hours. I didn't support their $1.50 tax increase, but I think their $1.50 tax increase is a lot more honest, is a lot more plain, a lot more doable. We have excise taxes on tobacco today of 24 cents. Congress last year, when we passed the kid-care bill, increased that another 15 cents. So, tobacco taxes are going to 39 cents already in present law. 
People say that the Commerce Committee bill, the administration bill, increases that another dollar and a dime. That takes the tax to $1.49. But they do not call it a tax, they call it a fee. So we are telling everybody who is in this industry--and we have wholesalers and distributors and so on--that the tax is $1.49 and it is increasing. But that bill, the bill that we have before us, doesn't saying anything about a dollar and a dime. It says put all these billions of dollars into a fund. That is not very workable. It is not very legitimate. I think we should have the committees of jurisdiction take this bill. 
The Finance Committee did take the bill, but unfortunately the Commerce Committee and the administration looked at our changes, and they just ignored them. They dropped the changes that the Finance Committee made. 
I resent having the Commerce Committee write the tax portions of this bill as well as I resent the Commerce Committee writing the ag portions of the bill. And I think those are two of the more contentious and two of the more difficult things that we have to deal with. The committee that marked it up didn't have, in my opinion, the taxation expertise, they didn't follow the same taxation procedures that we have on every other excise tax in history. And, frankly, I think the Agriculture Committee should have written that instead of the Commerce Committee as well.

Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I will be brief. I know my colleague from Texas has been waiting to speak on the amendment. But there were a few things implied by my colleague's statements, the chairman of the Commerce Committee. He said, `The Senator from Oklahoma doesn't agree with the look-back assessments that were part of the attorney general's agreement. And if the tobacco companies agree to it, why would he be opposed to look-back?' 
I was not part of that agreement. I think my colleague from Arizona once said, `Why don't you introduce the tobacco settlement so we can mark up from that bill?' I did not do it. The chairman of the Commerce Committee did. I did not do it because I was not comfortable with it. I did not do it because I do not want to introduce a bill that says tobacco companies will be exempt from class action suits. 
I did not do it because I looked at look-back assessments and said, `That's no way to tax.' I think there is a right way to tax and a wrong way to tax. This is the wrong way to tax. And so to attack me and say that if I am against look-back penalties I am also against every health professional or expert is ridiculous. 
I think this is a crummy way to tax. I have told my colleagues, you want a tax? Tax. Call it a tax. Don't hide behind saying, `It's a fee. It's an assessment.' 
I just read the attorneys general's deal with the tobacco companies. They did not say anything about having a survey and deeming it `proper and correct' and so on. My point being, I am not part of the deal that the attorneys general negotiated. They did not ask me. I am part of the Finance Committee, which is responsible for raising taxes. This Congress has already raised tobacco taxes. And if Senators want to increase them again, they have the right. 
We raised the tobacco tax last year. I did not vote for it. I do not know if my friend and colleague from Arizona did or not. 
But we increased tobacco taxes last year 15 cents. The increases have not gone into effect yet, but they will. They are on the books. And that is the way we should do it. That is the way the system works. This convoluted system of industry payments going up to $1.10, plus look-back penalty is wrong. Originally the look-back was $2 billion in the settlement, and then the Commerce Committee bill was $3.96 billion, and then the bill that was introduced on Monday that we have before us is $4.4 billion. And then the amendment that was offered this afternoon goes to $7.7 billion. 
I am just saying this is not a workable tax. And I did not agree to the tobacco settlement. So my colleague from Arizona, I believe insinuated that I support the tobacco companies. I do not support the tobacco companies. I just think this is a crummy way to tax, and I resent this idea that whoever opposes look-back is supportive of the tobacco industry.

Mr. NICKLES. I appreciate that. 
I am going to make two other very quick remarks. One, the negotiated look-back with the attorney generals was not product specific. And the amendment that we have before us goes to $5.5 billion in penalties on a product specific basis, which means we are going to do a survey on every tobacco product used by teenagers and assess penalties on every single product. Now, isn't that bureaucratic, isn't that a mess. 
I hope people will understand this is a big expense. And some people think it is a move in the right direction. I think it is a move in the wrong direction. 
Before my colleague from Arizona leaves, he said, `Didn't Senator Lott ask Senator Nickles to head this tobacco effort up and pull all the committee Chairs together,' and we then assigned the responsibilities to the Commerce Committee chairman? 
I say that when I was involved in this particular phase of it, that the linchpin of granting immunity--and I see that as a linchpin in this legislation fell to the Commerce Committee. If there was going to be a deal--and that is what the attorneys general's settlement was predicated on--the fact that if you grant tobacco companies limited immunity from class action suits, they will pay so many billions of dollars, about $15 billion. 
Now, conceivably, that could be put in the Commerce Committee. But I really believe that the Finance Committee should have jurisdiction over the tax. I have been upset about it ever since. I do think that if we are going to have a tax, we ought to call it a tax. We should not hide behind fees and we should not have look-backs assessments. I think these issues are the responsibility of the Finance Committee. And I think if we did that, we would tax tobacco just like we always taxed tobacco. 
I think the Commerce Committee, with all due respect, did a crummy job. Its bill has different prices for different brands of snuff. It exempts some tobacco companies from a tax. It hits other tobacco companies hard. I find that to be inequitable. I think the tax should be so much per product, and let us just say how much a pack it is, how much a can it is and how much a pouch, 
so people will know. I believe that very, very strongly. And so I communicate that to my friend and colleague. 
I appreciate the fact that my friend from Texas has been so patient. I yield the floor.

Mr. NICKLES. Just for the Senators' information, now the Senate just had a vote on limiting legal fees. That probably is not the only vote that we are going to have on that issue. And the Senator managing the bill, I compliment him for doing a very good job. 
I might mention, some of us also have statements we would like to make on the bill. We have been on the bill now for a day. This is a very extensive, expensive bill. Some of us wish to speak on the bill. We wish to tell our constituents what is in this bill, maybe why we have some concerns, maybe so we might be able to influence people on how various amendments might go. 
But I just tell my friend and colleague from Arizona, certainly the idea of going back and forth on amendments is acceptable, I think, for all Senators certainly on this side. But in all likelihood, there will be additional amendments dealing with the issue we just debated.

Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I will be very brief. I am not trying to delay my colleague from Massachusetts. 
I am telling my colleague from Arizona--and actually I told him in private what my colleague from Texas just said--I am not going to agree to a unanimous consent. This proposal was to vote on a $1.50 tax increase, and vote on or in relation to the amendment at 10 a.m. tomorrow morning. I am not going to. That is one of the largest tax increases in history. It says no 
second-degree amendments. Some of us aren't quite ready to go quite that fast. 
This idea of saying submit all your amendments--I am working on a bunch of amendments, but I will tell you we just got the bill last night. We were being pretty collegial saying we are not going to object to going to the bill. We could have tied the Senate up for 3 days and had more time to study the bill. Some of us need time to study the bill. Some of us are reading the bill and there are interesting things to find. 
On the first day the bill is on the floor to say we will have an amendment introduced at 6 p.m. and we will vote tomorrow morning at 10 a.m. on the largest tax increase, without giving us a chance to offset it, without giving us a chance to amend it, I think is a serious mistake. 
Now, we are not going to be railroaded. It takes unanimous consent to pass this kind of amendment or get this kind of agreement. I told my good friend from Arizona he is not going to get it. So we can have the debate. We need to have the debate. We need to talk about whether this is a tax increase or price increase. I think we need to study this thing a little bit further and not try to railroad it through the Senate. 
I am happy to yield to my friend from Utah.

Mr. NICKLES. I appreciate my colleague's remarks, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee. I know he has had hearings on at least tobacco legislation. I don't know that anybody has had hearings on this bill. 
Right now we are being asked to vote on some of the most significant amendments of this bill and we really have had very little time to even debate the general provisions of the bill, to maybe ask the sponsor of the bill and the proponents of the bill to explain some sections. 
Just to give you an example, there is a look-back provision. The Senator from Utah said maybe it is unconstitutional. There was a look-back provision that was added that wasn't passed out of the Commerce Committee and that wasn't passed out of the Finance Committee. It was just added. It was introduced last night. The look-back provision says we are going to do sampling and find out. If we don't meet the target for teenage consumption, as specified, there will be a penalty of $1,000 per teenager who smokes specific brands. 
It looks very bureaucratic and, frankly, unworkable to this Senator.

Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I wish to thank the Chairman of the Senate Finance Committee and his staff for working closely with Senator Baucus, Senator Hutchison, and me on language in this bill to protect the trade secrets and confidential information of software publishers and their customers. The Senate IRS bill is far stronger than the House bill on these issues, and we appreciate the Chairman's efforts. To ensure fair and adequate implementation of this legislation, I would like to clarify our intent with regard to some of its provisions. 
First, this bill confirms that, in an IRS summons enforcement proceeding involving software, courts have the authority to issue `any order necessary to prevent the disclosure of trade secrets and other confidential information' with respect to software. I believe this authority is inherent in the existing powers of the judiciary in summons enforcement proceedings, and that our legislation simply reaffirms this authority with respect to the proceedings involving software. Mr. President, this clarification would make clear that the court can also issue orders to protect confidential taxpayer information associated with the software. 
Secondly, the legislation currently provides that `the Secretary will make a good faith and significant effort to ascertain the correctness of an item' prior to issuance of a summons for software source code. It is my belief that a good faith and significant effort requires that the IRS conduct a thorough review of the taxpayer's books, records, and other data, including the issuance of Information Document Requests and following-up those requests appropriately. This clarification would make certain that source code should be summoned as a last resort only.

Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I rise today in support of this legislation. I compliment Senator Roth and Senator Moynihan, for having the most significant oversight hearings that we have had in this Congress, indeed for the last several Congresses. A lot of us have said we need to do better oversight, and we talked about it but we didn't do it. This is the case where the Finance Committee had the first serious oversight of the IRS in our history. It is long overdue, and it uncovered a lot of things. It uncovered ugly examples of Government abuse of power, Government abuse of power which should never have happened, which was exposed, and I believe with this legislation, we are going to help correct it and make sure it doesn't happen again. 
I compliment Senator Roth and Senator Moynihan for those hearings. Those hearings were initially held in September, and then we had follow-up hearings just last month. Each additional set of hearings kept showing abuses that were even more outlandish than the ones before, culminated by the fact that one disgruntled IRS agent actually had tried to set up Senator Howard Baker, and a Congressman and a district attorney. Unbelievable; unbelievable abuse of power. I compliment our colleagues for the oversight hearings. 
I also compliment Senator Kerrey and Senator Grassley for their work on a commission that helped give us some material to produce good reform. We had the hearings, and we also had legislative oversight and some work done through their commission to produce recommendations for a positive legislative overhaul. I compliment both Senator Grassley and Senator Kerrey for their fine work in doing that. 
Also, I compliment our colleagues in the House. We had the hearings in the Senate in September, and our colleagues in the House passed IRS reform legislation on November 5. I disagree with my colleagues on the Democratic side who said, `We should have passed the House bill.' Senator Roth and some of us said we can do better than the House, and I think we have. The House bill was a giant step in the right direction, but we have done a lot more than the House did. The House did not have legislation to deal with innocent spouse issues, which we also had hearings on and which showed a lot of innocent spouses were abused by the IRS system. We are correcting that in this legislation. 
We had a hearing in Oklahoma. It was the first IRS field hearing that we have had. It was one I found very interesting. We 
had Oklahomans who testified about some of the problems they had. As a result of their testimony, we made this legislation better. I will give a couple of examples. 
We had Lisa New, who is a young lady from Guthrie, OK, testify. She was a pet groomer. She groomed pets. She was a school bus driver, and she was a single mother. She owed the IRS $4,000 in 1986. She found out about it and went to the IRS. She said, `I owe you this money. I would like to pay it off $100 a month.' IRS said, `No, we want it all immediately.' She couldn't pay it, so the IRS put a lien on her home. 
Her debt to the IRS, as of last month, totaled about $30,000 of interest and penalties on an original $4,000 debt back in 1986. 
In this legislation, we say that penalties and interest will not accrue to the deficiency if the IRS does not notify the taxpayer within 1 year. We also say the IRS will be required to adopt a liberal acceptance policy for offers in compromise. They clearly did not do that in this case. We also say liens would not be allowed if the original tax debt was less than $5,000. So we make some changes. 
We had another case where an individual, whom a lot of people in this room might recognize--he is somewhat of a well-known Olympic athlete coach--Steve Nunno. He was coach of the U.S. Olympic gymnastics team, coach of Shannon Miller, a great all-American coach. He had a problem with the IRS. His business grew a lot, and he was making quarterly payments for payroll taxes. Then his business grew some more. Suddenly, he was supposed to make payroll tax payments monthly. He got a little bit behind. He recognized that. He said he was willing to work it out, and he worked it out with an agent. They signed an agreement that if he makes these payments of so much per month over this period, that would be acceptable. 
Then the IRS changed agents. A new agent came in and said, `No, we want to be paid immediately, and if you don't pay up immediately, we're going to put a padlock on your business and put a lien on your business.' He was traveling in Europe with the U.S. Olympians and his team, and he had an IRS agent threatening to close down his gymnastics business. It is absolutely absurd. He borrowed the money. He was able to pay it off. 
We put in provisions to make sure that would not happen again. We now say that a taxpayer will be given the opportunity of a court hearing before liens, levies or seizures. He is going to have a chance to have a hearing. He is going to have an appeals process. Not a single agent is going to be able to come in and say, `I disagree with you; if you don't pay up by'--such and such a date--`we are going to padlock your business.' We protect that taxpayer. We say the IRS can only seize the taxpayer's business or home as a last resort. 
Unfortunately, we found out in Oklahoma and Arkansas as a result of our investigation that we had seizure rates in this district about eight times the national average, and we even found that there were incentives for employees to close those cases. `We don't care if you seize the assets, close those cases,' and people would receive financial benefits. We stopped that in this legislation. 
We also say that notices to taxpayers must include the name and phone number of the IRS contact. They will know somebody to call. They are not going to get the runaround and talk to 15 different agents when they are trying to deal with a case. We have that in this legislation. 
None of that, I might add, was in the House bill. None of it was in the House bill. I can mention a couple others. 
We had Dr. Jim Highfill of Ponca City testify. He is a dentist. He had IRS agents come into his office and announce that he was under investigation. We put provisions in this bill that says the IRS will be reorganized so that small businesses will only work with IRS employees specializing in small business issues. That will help solve some of these problems. 
We also say IRS employees who disclose taxpayer information, such as notices of summons, will be subject to termination. The IRS agents came into his office and said, `We've got a summons for this dentist,' in front of his patients to embarrass him, to intimidate him. We now make those agents subject to termination. 
We found abuse after abuse, and we found IRS agents were not terminated. I will mention that most of the 102,000 IRS agents and employees are outstanding civil servants, but some have abused their power, and they should be terminated for that abuse of power. In almost every case we listened to, they were not terminated. 
We also say that advice from a CPA to a taxpayer will be privileged the same as advice from a tax attorney. I could go on. 
We put a lot of provisions in the Senate bill that were not in the House bill. We made it better. I wouldn't say it is perfect, but I think it is a lot better. There was a reason for the Senate to be a little more deliberate. It was the Senate that had the initial hearings. The House marked up the bill, and, again, my compliments to the House. Sometimes they do things a little more quickly, but sometimes we do them a little bit better. 
This is a more thorough bill. This is a bill that has been researched better. We are solving more problems for taxpayers in this bill. 
Finally, at the hearings that we had in the last couple of weeks, we heard different cases. In Texas, there was a business that had 32 employees, and 64 IRS agents raided the business. Their intent was to intimidate and abuse their power. 
Or the case in Virginia Beach where an individual had a restaurant, a dozen or so IRS agents broke into his restaurant, his home, and his partner's home, broke his door down. They certainly abused their power. Agents who abuse their power should be terminated. 
Or for example the investigation of Senator Baker and others, that was certainly abuse power. Those people who supervised that IRS agent are also responsible, not just the bad apple in this case. He was eventually terminated because he was arrested for having cocaine in his car, not for the abuse of the investigation of a Senator, a Congressman, and a district attorney. 
So not only should he have been disciplined, but his supervisor who did not corral him, after some very honest and good employees said, `Wait a minute; this investigation is going too far,' and tried to stop it. Their supervisors did not discipline the person who was responsible. They should have been terminated. They should have felt the penalties for not reining in the IRS. 
The IRS has been out of control. In many, many cases they abuse their power. So this bill is going to try to rein in the IRS, make the IRS more accountable to taxpayers, make sure that they understand the `S' in `Internal Revenue Service' stands for `service,' that they are servants, that they work for the people, not the other way around, and that the people who are God-fearing and are willing to pay their taxes have nothing to fear of the IRS. They may have some disputes because of the complexity of the law, but if they are willing to pay their fair share of taxes, they are not trying to cheat the system, they should not fear the IRS gestapo-type tactics that we have heard about in recent weeks. 
So I again want to compliment Senator Roth and Senator Moynihan, Senator Grassley, Senator Kerrey, and other people, who have worked to put together, I think, a very good bill, a positive bill, one that will be of real benefit to taxpayers and one that we can say, yes, we have done something positive, and we have worked together to make it happen. 
I am pleased that now the President is supporting this bill. I might mention--I look at a statement from the Washington Post dated October 1, 1997. It says: President Clinton opposes legislative reform of the IRS saying, `I believe the IRS is functioning better today than it was 5 years ago.' 
He was speaking in reference to the Republican reform proposals. `We should not politicize it and we should not do anything that will in any way call into question whether it is evenhanded or fair in the future.' 
Originally, President Clinton was against this bill. Originally, Secretary Rubin was against this bill. I am glad they decided they would support the House bill. I am glad they have decided they would support the Senate bill. Both are good pieces of legislation. Both need to pass. Both need to become law. 
Mr. President, again, I thank the sponsors and look forward to this becoming the law of the land. I yield the floor.

Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, the amendment that I send to the desk on behalf of myself and also Senator Smith of New Hampshire basically says that under the report that is required by the resolution of ratification right now, the report says that we should have a study considering the cost of deployment of a NATO missile defense system for the region of Europe. I think, frankly, it should apply to all NATO countries. 
That is the essence of the amendment. This is a NATO treaty. This is a mutual defense treaty for all NATO countries. All NATO countries are saying that they will come to one another's aid for the following reasons. If we are going to have a missile defense study for Europe, it certainly should have a missile defense study for the United States and for Canada. 
That is the essence of my amendment. It is to make sure that we are not just having a treaty just to defend Europe but it is also to defend the United States and, of course, Canada, which I believe, as both the United States and Canada are instrumental and very important members of NATO, should not be denigrated and should not be put in a separate category or separate class. 
I want to compliment my colleague from North Carolina for his leadership on this issue. He has done a very good job, as has the ranking member. 
I will tell my colleagues. It has been I think a proud week for the Senate. We have not had a partisan vote yet. We have had a very, very significant foreign policy debate. I compliment my colleague from Virginia and my colleague from New York, Senator Moynihan, for raising some very important issues. 
Some people said, `Well, the Senate hasn't considered this treaty. I will tell my colleagues, I think a lot of it has addressed this treaty pretty closely and even the committee reports. This is the committee report section. A lot of times some of us don't read those things. I happened to read this, or my staff brought it to my attention. I said, `Wait a minute. This doesn't make sense. We are going to correct this.' 
I appreciate my colleagues on the other side of the aisle for their willingness to accept this amendment. But I think we have had some good debates. I think it has been very positive for the Senate and also positive for the mutual defense of all NATO countries. 
I thank my colleagues. I also want to thank my colleague from New Hampshire for his leadership on this amendment as well.

Mr. NICKLES. I compliment my colleague from North Carolina for his work on the State Department reorganization bill. He has worked on it for years. He has done good work. It will save taxpayers a lot of money and make the State Department more accountable and do a better job. 
We have heard colleagues on the other side say, I will not support it because of the so-called abortion provision. The only thing in this bill that deals with abortion is that it basically says we don't want to have U.S. money used to lobby other countries to change their laws. What in the world makes people think that we are so right on abortion, this administration's philosophy is so right on abortion, we should be lobbying other countries to change their position? Some countries are pro-life. They have it in their constitution; they have it in their legislature. Why should U.S. tax money be used to lobby those countries to change their laws? That is a serious mistake--a serious mistake. 
I heard somebody say we haven't changed Mexico City policy. There is no restriction in here. These International Planned Parenthoods can use their money for abortions overseas. That is not even in this. The only restriction is, anybody that received nongovernmental entity can't use money to lobby other countries to change their laws and influence other countries on abortion. I don't think we should do that. We certainly shouldn't have U.S. tax moneys doing that. 
I think this is a decent compromise. I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to pass this.

Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, money is fungible. We had the law of the land under President Reagan and President Bush for 10 years, 12 years, a certain number of those years. No money should be used by these organizations if they take U.S. money to fund abortions or to lobby governments. Whether it be government money or their money, we said, `No; if you are going to get U.S. money, you can't go in and take other money and use it to pay for abortions or lobby other countries.' 
Money is fungible, so the net result is, what we are trying to say is, wait, if you are going to take U.S. taxpayer dollars, don't use money and shuffle money around in accounts and lobbying other countries to change their laws. They are representing our Government in many cases. If they are getting U.S. taxpayer money and they are lobbying and using that money to set up family planning, and they are also lobbying, a lot of other countries are going to think that is the U.S. Government or would think that is taxpayer dollars. That is a mistake. 
This is a reasonable compromise. I urge my colleagues to pass it.

<TEXT>
Mr. NICKLES. I appreciate my colleague's response. I said, How much is it going to cost? She said it is in the President's budget. The President's budget says we will spend $7.3 billion to hire an additional 100,000 teachers. It doesn't really define in the budget how that is going to be done. My colleague from Washington said it is going to be done like we did community policing. He has a goal to hire 100,000 community police. When that started out, it was 100 percent or 75 percent Federal, and then 50 percent Federal, and then 25 percent Federal each succeeding year, and the individual communities had to pick up the greater costs. 
I laugh at that. A lot of communities are saying, `We like the program when the Federal Government is paying all of it. We don't like it when we have to pay all of it.' 
Then I asked my communities in the State, I went around to several communities--I am sure several of my colleagues did--and said, `Are you going to get one of these teachers? Is your school going to get a teacher? Is your school going to get a teacher? Who is going to be lucky enough to get the Federal teacher?' I don't think it makes any sense. 
Do I want smaller class size? I would say, in general, yes. Do I think the Federal Government should mandate it, should pay for it? The answer is no. I think the solution is, as our Senator from Washington said, let's give the money and power and control back to the States, and if they want smaller class size, they can make that decision. If they want new buildings, they can make that decision. If they want new computers, they can make that decision. We should not try to say, `Oh, we think this classroom should have another teacher. 
We are going to have a Federal teacher here and have the Federal Government pay 75 percent of it or 50 percent of it for the first year.' I just don't think it makes sense. I don't think it is affordable. 
The $7.3 billion the President had in his budget was financed on the so-called tobacco deal, and we don't even know whether or not it is going to happen. So I urge my colleagues to support the amendment of my friend and colleague from Arkansas saying that 95 percent of this money should go directly to the classroom. I urge my colleagues not to say we should be dictating to the States how, and put Federal teachers or federally-paid-for teachers in the schools. I think it would be a serious mistake. 
If we want to have a sense of the Senate, `Hey, we urge you to have smaller class size,' and leave it to the States, fine. But the implication of the amendment of the Senator from Washington is that we need to have the President's program, we need to have the Federal Government writing checks for teachers in individual school districts, and I think that is a mistake.

Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, once again, our domestic oil and gas producers are facing devastating losses due to a significant drop in oil prices. This crisis creates a dangerous situation for the industry and for our national security. Unfortunately, the policies and practices of the Administration have exacerbated the problem, not helped. If we are to maintain a viable domestic petroleum industry, we must reverse these practices. An important step towards this end is reforming the Department of Interior's erratic, ever-changing royalty valuation practices. The Royalty Enhancement Act, that I am introducing today, will reduce regulatory costs and promote development of federal oil and gas resources vital to our national security. It will also significantly reduce the administrative costs associated with the federal royalty payment system. 
Minerals Management Service (MMS), the agency within the Department of Interior given responsibility for administering royalties from federal leases, has imposed on oil and gas producers a bureaucratic labyrinth of rules and regulations. One of the most fundamental concepts of our society is the ability of any citizen, in particular, citizens who are parties to contracts with the federal government to be assured that the Federal government will not overreach and unilaterally interpret those contracts. Such a situation is what we have today with oil and gas producers who have contracted with the Federal government to expend their capital and resources to explore for, drill and produce valuable oil and gas reserves in the United States and offshore. 
In the past few years oil and gas producers, both independent and major, have become increasingly frustrated with the unwillingness by MMS to produce a simplified and certain valuation method that accurately captures the value of oil or gas at the lease. This is the value that a federal oil and gas lessee owes and the American taxpayer deserves to be paid. 
Recently, the MMS has proposed a new oil valuation rule which is the most administratively burdensome and complex method, available to the government. This new rule looks like the Clinton health care plan and makes the IRS code look simple. In short, the current MMS valuation system is badly broken and their outstanding oil proposal will only make it worth. 
In 1995, I introduced the Federal Oil and Gas Royalty Simplification and Fairness Act because of the importance of federal royalty revenues to the United States Treasury and States. The purpose of that legislation was to streamline and simplify the royalty management program for the over 20,000 federal lessees who are required to file over 3,000,000 reports annually. Despite the bipartisan support for my bill, MMS resisted this much needed reform during the entire legislative process. Fortunately, Congress saw the wisdom and need for the law and sent it to the President and it became effective in August, 1996. 
Why is Congressional action needed, Mr. President? Despite the obvious importance of the oil and gas industry to our national economy and global stability, the MMS has failed to get the message we sent them in 1996 that the American people can no longer tolerate their ineffective and inefficient bureaucracy. The MMS valuation rules contain complicated formulas that can be both confusing and inaccurate. These ambiguous rules lead inevitably to expensive disputes and litigation that unnecessarily drain resources of the federal government and the lessees. 
To ensure that the American people receive their full and fair value of production royalties from oil and gas produced on federal lands, we need to create a royalty valuation system that provides certainty, simplicity and fairness to the federal government, States, oil and gas producers and the American taxpayers. Only by doing this will companies want to take the risk of spending their capital to develop and produce federal oil and gas for our nation's use and benefit. It is important that we maintain the viability of existing production on federal lands and encourage development of the new frontiers of production in the deep waters off our coastlines. 
Mr. President, my colleagues from New Mexico, Alaska, Texas and Louisiana, Senators Domenici, Murkowski, Hutchison and Breaux, join me today in introducing the Royalty Enhancement Act which is the Senate companion of H.R. 3334, a bill introduced this session by Congressman Thornberry. This bill cuts through the horrendously complicated and ambiguous current rules and provides certainty, simplicity and fairness to both the taxpayers and the companies who enter into oil and gas leases with the federal government. 
This legislation will replace the current complicated and complex system of royalty valuation with a much clearer, simpler method of royalty payment that would avoid valuation disputes. This method will allow companies to pay the federal government its royalty share in actual barrels of oil or cubic feet of natural gas. 
The bill contains a comprehensive well-designed royalty payment method that will streamline auditing and accounting systems for both the government and the producers and will reduce administrative costs. Reduced costs will help keep production economic for a longer period, extending the life of producing wells and thus providing more royalties from this continued production. The best way to be absolutely certain that the government receives fair market value at the lease is for the government to take production in-kind and have it marketed and sold by qualified private sector marketers who possess the expertise and experience to receive the best value for the United States. 
Mr. President, it is not fair to subject companies who produce oil and gas on federal lands to the whim of the MMS with their record of retroactive second-guessing of valuation years after oil and gas has been produced and sold. It is fundamentally unfair to the American people for the agency's uncertain and ambiguous rules and practices to create delay in receipt of royalty revenues to the Treasury and to bear the expense of the government's bureaucracy. For these reasons, I am introducing the Royalty Enhancement Act of 1998.

Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, this is an amendment offered by myself and Senator Murkowski. The net effect of it would be that if we are dealing with the budget process and the so-called wish list amendments, the sense of the Senate and sense of Congress would basically be ruled out of order. My amendment would instruct the Chair to make precatory amendments not germane to the budget resolution. That means you would need 60 votes to pass it. At one point, we had 100 amendments, and over two-thirds of them were precatory amendments; they were wishes. The word precatory means to wish. That doesn't change the budget resolution, and it wastes a lot of time. It means that, yes, we have some kind of sparring back and forth. I don't know how many votes we have had in the last couple of days, two-thirds of them have been sense of the Senate or sense of the Congress. And, really, they will have very little impact on the budget process. I think they have made the Senate look bad in the process. 
I urge my colleagues to support the amendment. I am not going to request the yeas and nays unless it is necessary. I think this would help us do our business in a much more orderly and efficient manner.

<TEXT>
Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I will be happy to go. We generally alternate back and forth. It doesn't make any difference. 
Mr. President, I rise in strong opposition to the Kennedy amendment. At a certain point I will be offering a second-degree amendment. 
Senator Kennedy's amendment--maybe I should read from it. It is a sense of the Senate that Congress should pass the bill called the `Consumer Bill of Rights,' I believe. 
Now, I might mention the Senator introduced this bill 2 nights ago. I have a copy of the bill which was introduced, the companion bill which is in the House. It is 68 pages. It is the Federal Government getting involved in many areas that possibly my colleagues haven't had a chance to examine. I know this bill has only been introduced for a couple days, but it is a pretty far-reaching bill. It is a bill that treats private plans differently than union plans. It is a bill that says we in Government know best. It is a bill that has lots and lots of mandates. It is a bill that will increase the cost of health care. It is a bill that does not track the President's Commission on Quality Care. 
I met with some of the Commission on Quality Care just recently. They didn't have a consensus to legislate. As a matter of fact, there was a push by the administration and others that we need to legislate a patients' bill of rights. But that was not the consensus of the commission. As a matter of fact, the commission did not recommend legislation. Yet even though the commission, which studied this issue for 10 months, didn't recommend legislation, here comes a bill, 68 pages, and now, without even having the ink dry on the bill, we have people saying let's pass this. 
It has a great title. I agree it is a great title. I compliment my colleague from Massachusetts. Boy, any time you say something has a bill of rights, it has to be good. Unfortunately, the closer you look at this legislation, it is not good. I don't think it is good if you increase costs for patients. I don't think it is good if you increase Federal mandates. I don't think it is good if you increase costs to where a lot of people cannot afford insurance. And I don't think there is a relationship between increasing regulations and increasing quality. As a matter of fact, it may be inversely related; you may have more Federal regulations and more money and resources that health care providers have, and instead of using those for providing quality, they are going to be using them to provide for compliance and health care quality goes down. 
So while I compliment my colleague from Massachusetts for having a great title on this proposal that is only 2 days old, I don't think the Congress should be committing itself to passing it. I think it would be a serious mistake. 
I might mention, this is not just the Senator from Oklahoma saying this. I am looking at health care providers who have serious reservations. I will just give you one example. This is a quote from the American Hospital Association regarding the bill which was recently introduced: 
However, the President's quality commission confirmed there is no consensus that Federal legislation introduced today by House and Senate Democrats is the way to achieve these best objectives. The AHA believes the private sector can and must meet the challenge to protect consumers and improving the quality of care. Federal legislation should be considered only if all private sector efforts fail. 
We have not even given them a chance. We are saying we know best and we are going to mandate it. We are going to dictate it. 
Mr. President, I will reserve the remainder of my time.

Mr. NICKLES. Just a couple of comments. 
My colleague said that the President's Commission on Quality endorses these proposals, but they specifically did not endorse legislation. There is a big difference. Do we want to encourage the private sector to improve quality and access and information? You bet. But when you come up with a 68-page bill and say here is what you must do, there is a difference. The President's commission did not say legislate. The Senator's sense-of-the-Senate says legislate. The underlying sense-of-the-Senate resolution provides for enactment of legislation to establish a patients' bill of rights which was just introduced 2 days ago that will increase health care costs. I think that is a serious mistake.

Mr. NICKLES. No, not on my time. I only have a minute left. 
So I just make the comment that people can talk about these goals. I will agree with the goals. But when you try to mandate them by legislation, saying that we know better, that we are going to dictate to the Mayo Clinic, here is what you must do, we are going to dictate to the Cleveland clinic; we know better, Congress knows better, the Senator from Massachusetts knows better, we are going to dictate it by legislation, I disagree. I do not think that will improve quality. I think it would be a serious mistake. 
I urge my colleagues at the appropriate time to vote no on the Kennedy amendment, and I will offer a second-degree amendment shortly.

Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I have sent my amendment to the desk for various reasons, one of which is, my colleague from Massachusetts has an amendment which he calls a Patients' Bill of Rights. It sounds like a good title, but, frankly, I am concerned it will increase costs, I am concerned it will increase regulation, and because it will increase costs, the number of uninsured will rise, and without question it will increase regulation. 
The bill that he refers to, the bill that he recently introduced--it also has the same title--called the Patients' Bill of Rights Act of 1998, is 68 pages long and has a lot of details in it. It has a lot of things that every health care plan in America would have to provide. That would cost a lot. It has a lot of the same language that is in the so-called PARCA, the Patients Access to Responsible Care Act. Estimates were made on that bill that it would increase costs 23 percent. That is a big increase. If you increase health care costs 23 percent, you are going to put a lot of people who had insurance in the uninsured category. I think that would be a serious mistake. People who have done their homework on this legislation, and maybe are experts in it, have come out and said, `We have reviewed this Patients' Bill of Rights and find it severely lacking.' 
Here is a quote from the Health Care Leadership Council. They said, `a vote for the Kennedy amendment is a vote for greater involvement by lawyers and bureaucrats in our health care system. To improve American health care we need to empower individuals, not government. We need every medical dollar to go to medical services, not to lawyers and legal fees.' 
One of the reasons for the reference to lawyers and legal fees is that it would allow insurers and businesses to be sued for not providing coverage; not just for the coverage, but also for pain and suffering, for punitive damages. So you would have health care insurers as well as businesses, who would be worried more about litigation than consumer care. I think that would be an enormously expensive provision, and people need to know it. 
I will continue with the Health Care Leadership Council. They said: 
The bureaucratic regulations that would result from the Democrats' patient bill of rights legislation would add unnecessary complexity to the health care system. Complexity steals time from patients and forces health care providers to focus on regulatory compliance instead of improving the quality of care. 
The Chamber of Commerce of the United States, which represents companies throughout the country says: 
We urge your opposition to an amendment expected to be offered by Senator Kennedy to the budget resolution today expressing the sense of the Senate that a patient bill of rights proposal should be enacted this session . . . 
The goal of improving health care quality can be better achieved through the power of the marketplace. 
The National Federation of Independent Business says: 
The Kennedy amendment would dangerously place the Senate on record in support of health care mandates prior to carefully examining the issues of cost, coverage, regulation and litigation. Additionally, it is premature given the work of respective health care task force groups in the Senate and House and private-sector efforts. Thus, we hope you will not rush to legislate on the basis of antidotes rather than sound decisionmaking. Big Government mandates substitute Government intervention for quality innovations currently taking place in the private health care market are the wrong prescriptions for America's health care system. 
Also, I have a letter from the Council on Affordable Health Insurance: 
Bill of rights is a cruel hoax when the cost of those rights will result in health insurance which is unaffordable for those privately purchasing or causes employers to drop health insurance coverage altogether. Both Congress and the States have enacted laws to make health insurance accessible to almost every American who seeks coverage. Access to health insurance is meaningless if Congress makes it unattainable because of regulations placing it financially out of reach for many Americans.

Mr. NICKLES. I appreciate the fact that my colleagues on the Democratic side say they will support our amendment, but I want to inform them that our amendment is in direct contradiction with their amendment. 
Our amendment says we shouldn't do anything to increase health care costs. My colleagues want to say that the proposal by the Senator from Massachusetts doesn't increase costs. They can say it, but it is not true. 
The facts are the Lewin Group, for example, did a study on the so-called PARCA bill and said it increased costs 23 percent. Granted, the bill that the Senator introduced 2 days ago and is calling upon the Senate to pass may not be exactly the same thing, but it has a lot of common elements, and it will increase costs. 
The Nickles resolution says we shouldn't increase costs because that increases uninsured. Common sense. And it says we shouldn't require health care providers to spend a lot of money defending themselves instead of providing quality care. 
The proposal by my colleague from Massachusetts refers to the patient bill of rights. His bill of rights says we should pass legislation. I mention that the President's commission did not say we should pass legislation. They are not consistent. Should we try to improve quality care? Sure. Should we pass legislation mandating a fixed definition of quality care? I don't think so. 
To give an example, a letter from Bob Waller of Mayo Clinic says, `Providers of care are in the unique position based on the personal commitment to the well-being of the individual patient to drive quality improvement initiatives. 
Nothing could stifle innovation quicker than external mandatory standards.' Now, that is not from some insurance carrier. That is the director of the Mayo Clinic, one of the top providers of quality health care in the world. 
The Cleveland Clinic states: 
We are already subject to extensive Federal, State and private regulations through oversight by private payors and accrediting bodies. Adding yet another layer of regulation will only further complicate matters, add administrative costs to our organization, and in all likelihood have little or no effect on the actual quality of care provided.

Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, these are not insurers. They are providers of care saying that more regulation will do just the opposite--it will increase costs. Experts are saying the Kennedy proposal will increase costs and therefore increase the uninsured and add a lot of money being expended for defensive purposes in litigation, not for improving quality of care. That is a mistake. 
I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of my amendment, cosponsored by Senators Jeffords, Frist, Collins, and others. I thank them for their comments. I urge my colleagues to vote no on the Kennedy amendment.

I tell you, if you voted for the Nickles-Jeffords amendment, you should not vote for Senator Kennedy's amendment, because the amendment we just adopted, I guess unanimously, said that we do not want to increase costs. The Kennedy amendment says, let us pass the so-called patients' bill of rights. That was introduced 2 days ago. It is 68 pages long. It has lots and lots of mandates, mandates that will increase costs. And as costs go up, the number of uninsured will go up. 
This bill has hundreds of regulations in it. So if you want more regulations instead of patient care, that would be what you would be voting for in Senator Kennedy's amendment. I mention that this is opposed by individuals from the Mayo Clinic to the Cleveland Clinic to some of the best health care providers in the world. They are saying: You are going to make us provide and spend our time litigating and regulating instead of providing quality health care. 
I urge my colleagues to vote no on the Kennedy amendment. And if they voted in favor of the last amendment, they certainly should vote no on the next one. You cannot tell me this thing does not have significant costs to the consumers.

Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I compliment my colleague from Pennsylvania for his statement. I also compliment Senator Roth for his resolution. I am happy to cosponsor this resolution. I hope we will have overwhelming bipartisan support for it, and hopefully everyone can understand what we are talking about doing. We are talking about saving Social Security. 
The President during his State of the Union speech says we want to save Social Security; we don't want to spend one dime of the surplus. Senator Roth is trying to save Social Security. Because we do not just save Social Security by not spending the surplus either in the form of additional outlays--frankly, the President is violating that as we speak because he wants to have a supplemental appropriations bill and doesn't want to pay for it. He is already violating what he said in the State of the Union Address. 
But I agree. We should save Social Security. This resolution says that we should take the surplus and allow individuals to set up personal savings accounts. I think that is the way to save Social Security. I think that is the way to fund Social Security. Right now we don't fund Social Security. It is an unfunded paying system. One generation pays for retired generations, or working employees today pay the Social Security tax. Social Security taxes are enormous. They have 
grown, and they have exploded in cost. 
As a matter of fact, somebody paying Social Security today is paying a total--if you look at Social Security taxes, their contribution today is a total of $10,465 if they have the maximum amount of income, which is $68,400. That is a lot. That actually includes Social Security and Medicare, I might mention. So that is a lot. Social Security is 12.4 percent of $68,000. That is a lot of money. That is over $9,000 that people are paying. If somebody happens to be making $68,000, they are paying a lot. What do they have to show for it? Nothing. They can't open up a bank account and say, `Here is my money for an investment.' Basically they are funding a previous commitment. 
Senator Roth is saying we should take the surplus and allow people to set up their own individual retirement accounts, let them be able to invest in the marketplace, let them be able to enjoy the rewards of compounding interest. Right now the rate of return on Social Security as an investment--some people say 1 percent, some people say 1.2 percent, or 1.3 percent. That is not a very good rate of return. It is pathetic if you consider what the market has done in the last several years. The marketplace--the Dow Jones or Standard & Poors 500--has been compounding in the 20 and 30 percent range for the last 4 years. But to have individuals be able to enjoy this? The answer is no, not in Social Security. 
Senator Roth has done something else. I really appreciate it, because it is important. He said not only should they be able to invest a portion, but also we should be able to use that money to reduce the unfunded promises that we now have in Social Security. 
I want to do this proposal for two reasons. 
One, I want millions of Americans to become millionaires. If we let them take--some people say 2 percent. I think it should be up to maybe 5 or 6 percent, maybe half of their Social Security tax. Of the Social Security tax of 12.4 percent of their income up to $68,000, you would let them put 6.2 percent of their income in for 40-some-odd years before they retire, and you will find that we will have lots of people who started out maybe making $20,000 a year who are going to be millionaires. 
Senator Roth's example is they put in 1 percent at age 28, and they can have over 100-some-odd thousands. That is 1 percent. Let's get it up, and it can really compound, and individuals can have hundreds of thousands of dollars, if not over a million dollars. 
I want those individuals to be wealthy, whether they are on the lower end of the income scale or in the higher end. We want them to be independent. 
Likewise, I want to reduce the unfunded promises that we don't have the money to pay for. I am really concerned about what our kids are going to have to pay for 20 years from now. If we do not do something, as Senator Roth is proposing--Senator Moynihan, Senator Breaux, and Senator Kerrey, and others of us have been working on it--our kids are going to be inheriting a debt that is twice as large as our national debt. Everybody is bragging around here. We are patting ourselves on the back. `Hey, we balanced the budget.' We are balancing the budget on using a great deal of Social Security surplus. That debt right now has accumulated, the Federal debt--usually people say about $3.3 trillion or $4 trillion. The unfunded vested promises that we have in Social Security today is almost 
$10 trillion, twice as large as our national debt. 
What this change by going to a capitalist-funded retirement system would do would provide security, provide retirement funds for individuals, and likewise could reduce the Government's obligations in the future--to me that is a very positive thing--so future generations won't have to have a payroll tax that is maybe twice as high as the payroll taxes we have today. I think it is a very positive thing. 
I might mention--I see a couple of colleagues on the floor who talked about how we should not use Social Security funds to balance the budget. Today the Social Security trust fund, this year 1998, $101 billion more will go in than goes out. That is a surplus. Yet, we are using that surplus just like every administration has used it since we have had Social Security. 
What I would like to see it do--I might mention the Budget Committee has already passed it. I was interested. I was going to introduce a resolution that says we should pass in 2 or 3 years--3 years, let's say--the budget resolution that doesn't use one dime of Social Security trust funds to balance the budget. 
I tell my colleague from North Dakota, who has talked about this on more than one occasion, that I am willing to do it. It won't be easy, but we should do it. I tell my colleague that in 10 years the Social Security surplus will be $197 billion, almost $200 billion. I don't think we should use these Social Security revenues to balance the budget. If we balance the budget without that, we can make these moneys available for personal security accounts. Now you are talking about real money. You are talking about $200 billion in the year 2008 alone that can go into personal security accounts that can be invested in the stock market, that can be invested in mutual funds, that can be invested in bonds, that can be invested in T bills. Let the individual decide how he wants to invest it. We allow Federal employees to invest in the stock market, in bonds, and in T bills. Federal employees are able to do this. My colleague from Pennsylvania mentioned that they do it in Chile. They make investments. Surely Americans are capable of making these investments. I think it would be exciting to allow people to be able to invest their own money. It is their money. It is not the Government's money. We have been taking it from them. Shouldn't we allow, out of that 12.4 percent, the individuals to take maybe 4 percent or 5 or 6 percent and be able to invest it for themselves? In exchange for that, they will be a lot more dependent on themselves and a lot less dependent on the Government. 
This is a mandatory tax. Shouldn't we allow them to have part of that for themselves so they can have an account and look at it on a monthly basis, so it is there, and it is something they can count on, not for an unfunded Government promise that we hope will be there. Demographically, everybody who has ever looked at this problem says we have a real problem. Some people say we don't have problems until 30 years. That is hogwash. We have problems, as Senator Roth mentioned, in 12 years. 
It is estimated that by the year 2010 or 2012, for Social Security that line of more money going in switches. More money goes out. No later than 2012, more money goes out than in. We will start drawing on the trust fund. What is in the trust fund? Nothing but Government IOUs. That is the promise. The way we finance those--you say they are the same things as T 
bills or the paper equivalent. It is just an IOU. The way we pay for these is we issue more T bills. In 12 years we have a big problem. We will have enormously high payroll taxes and a lot of debt. You have to issue more debt. I think that is a bad solution. This is the right solution, and I will tell you that millions of people in the private sector have done this. We did it in my company. We went from a defined benefit to defined contribution plan. Our employees love us. I think we should give every American an opportunity to do this for at least part of their Social Security. It doesn't have to be for all of it. Some people say 2 percent. I said maybe it should be half of it--maybe 6.4 percent, 6.2 percent. The Government, the employer portion, can still go to meet current obligations. But, likewise, we would be reducing current or future obligations. I think that is very important. 
What Congress has done in the past--we have had problems with Social Security--is raise taxes. We raised the base. We raised the tax rate.

Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, we need to wean ourselves and get off of this addiction to this and take that money and allow people to put it in their own account. That to me is a challenge. We shouldn't be sitting back and saying, `Oh, we balance the budget. Aren't we proud of ourselves? We are doing good. We have a unified budget.' 
I think we should have a unified budget. But I think we should go back and let's balance the budget without using Social Security. Then let's allow people to take that amount of money and be able to put that in their own account. 
I might mention that in the 10 years, if we did that, there would be over $1.5 trillion that could go into individual accounts and we would have more constituents that would be happier with us than anything else we would do. We would do more to secure their retirement and their future than anything else we could do. 
I have even told the President's representatives. I said, if the President really wants to go down in history and show that he has done something significant, this change, this evolution of allowing at least part of Social Security to be funded as a defined contribution in a personal savings accounts would be an astronomically positive impact for not only this generation; I think it would be a positive impact for future generations, which history will record as having truly been a great thing to do for seniors, a very positive thing to do for future generations as well. 
So I compliment my colleague from Delaware, the chairman of the Finance Committee. I tell him that, as a member of that committee, I will work energetically to try to see that we can make this happen as soon as possible. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I rise today to object to the Clinton administration's continual, I would say, anti-Israel position, but certainly the anti-Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu position. President Clinton, during the 1996 Israeli election, was very involved, and he was very involved in favor of the Labor candidate. 
U.S. News & World Report quoted an aide in the White House saying: 
If he could get away with it, Clinton would wear a `Peres for Prime Minister' button. 
He was very involved in the election. His candidate didn't win. Since then, we have seen more anti-Netanyahu, or anti-Israel, statements from the administration that bothers this Senator. 
Yesterday there was a report in the paper that the United States was pressuring Israel to give up more of the West Bank. And I am wondering where my colleagues were. I remember when they thought that the Bush administration--and particularly Jim Baker--was putting pressure on Israel. They objected very strongly. They spoke out very strongly against that coercion. 
This administration has repeatedly tried to put pressure on Mr. Netanyahu, or repeatedly snubbed the Prime Minister of Israel, our best ally in the region, the only democracy in the region, and they have almost resorted to a philosophy of, Well, we are going to use snub diplomacy. As a matter of fact, an administration official was quoted in the Washington Post as calling the Clinton Administration's actions towards Mr. Netanyahu as snub diplomacy. 
There was an incident in November of last year where both planes--the President's plane and Netanyahu's plane--were adjacent to each other, and yet President Clinton couldn't find time to meet with him. This year, in January, Mr. Netanyahu was scheduled to be here in Washington--I will read something that was in the January 20 edition of the Washington Post: 
Having declined to find time for Netanyahu in November, even as the aircraft parked nose to tail at Los Angeles International Airport, Clinton is continuing what one administration official described as a deniable but obvious pattern of `snub diplomacy.' Today's schedule includes no breaking of bread, no visit to the Blair House, no joint public appearance, no touch at all of the usual warmth that greets Israeli leaders on visits of state. 
The Washington Post article includes this telling quote from an administration official: 
We are treating him like the President of Bulgaria, who is arriving to a modest reception on February 10. Actually, I think Clinton will go jogging with the President of Bulgaria. So that is not fair. 
I am embarrassed by this. 
Then there was a snub by the Secretary of State, Madeleine Albright, when she returned to Israel in February and expressed publicly that she was `sick and tired' of the positions taken by both sides in the peace process. I can understand why she might be upset at the Palestinians, after they continued to embrace violence and refused to change their national charter--which they have agreed to do on at least three previous occasions--that calls for the destruction of Israel, when the Palestinians have yet to reduce the size of their police force, as again they have agreed to do. And when the Palestinians walked away from the bargaining table when Israel was more than willing to work out problems encountered by the first phase of the troop redeployment. But to criticize Israel--for what? They have complied. The Palestinians didn't 
comply, but yet our Secretary of State treats them as equals. 
In the meetings that I alluded to before, the administration went to great lengths in January to give the same amount of attention--which is very little--to Mr. Netanyahu as it did to Mr. Arafat. 
I might mention that Mr. Arafat, not long before, was embracing one of the leaders of Hamas who was directly responsible for terrorism and violence and death on innocent women and children in the Middle East--embracing him. Yet they were treating Mr. Netanyahu and Mr. Arafat as equals. 
Then the administration remained silent when Mr. Arafat on February 13 was quoted as saying the `peace negotiators achieved nothing, nothing, nothing.' And then he goes on a little bit further. I will read this. It says: 
Reuters reported the same day that Mr. Arafat stated, `We declared the Palestinian state in Algiers in 1988, and we will declare it again in 1999 over our Palestinian land, despite those who wish it wouldn't happen, and whoever doesn't like it may drink from the Gaza Sea or the Dead Sea. We have made the greatest intifada. We can erase those years and start all over again.' 
As a matter of fact, Mr. Arafat said he was going to cross out the peace agreements and unleash a new uprising against Israel. 
Mr. President, to me those hardly seem to be the words of a man, who is really interested in peace. 
Did the administration criticize him for those kind of remarks? Not to my knowledge. As a matter of fact, we searched to see if there was any response from the State Department for any criticism for such unacceptable comments. There was nothing. 
Did they condemn him for those kinds of outlandish statements? No. Did they criticize him for not complying with the peace accord that he agreed to? No. 
Now we find the administration dragging its feet to fulfill the commitment that Congress has made--by a bipartisan, overwhelming vote in Congress--to move our Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. What has the administration done? Absolutely nothing. Absolutely nothing. Have they spent any money for site selection? Or have they done anything to make it happen that we would move our Embassy, as Congress called for, which we are supposed to be doing next year? The answer is no. This administration has done nothing in that regard. 
Now, what has the administration done? In yesterday's paper, the Washington Post, it is reported that President Clinton decided in principle to unveil an American peacemaking package that the Israeli Government categorically rejects. The article reports that the Clinton plan will require Israel to withdraw its troops from about 13 percent of the West Bank, calls for a time-out on Jewish settlements and includes unspecified steps by the Palestinians to address Israeli security concerns. In other words, the administration is trying to dictate to Israel, that yes, you have to give up more land. Our policy, ever since the recreation and recognition of the state of Israel in 1948, has always been to say that Israel has the right--not the United States--to guarantee the security of its land and its people. Yet, this administration is trying to put pressure on Israel. 
Are they putting pressure on the Palestinians for not living up to their commitments? For the third time, Mr. Arafat signs a document and says they will eliminate in their charter the section calling for the destruction of Israel. They have not done it yet. Why aren't they calling on the Palestinians to comply? Instead they put more pressure on Israel to give up more land. 
I think it is unconscionable that the United States would use our force, our leadership, our power, and our prestige to try to dictate to Israel that they must give up land that might jeopardize its security. I think that is a mistake. This administration has been doing it, certainly, ever since Mr. Netanyahu's election. They have not treated him with the respect that I think he should be accorded as the elected leader of Israel. Instead, this administration seems to think, we weren't happy with the election, so we are going to undermine Mr. Netanyahu. I resent that. 
I don't think this President of the United States, or any President of the United States, should be getting involved in Israeli politics and trying to influence elections, as this President did in 1996. Now he is putting continued pressure on the Netanyahu administration and Israel as a country to try to compel or force it to give up additional lands, which might jeopardize its security. Who should make the decision whether it jeopardizes Israel's security, the United States or Israel? Frankly, I think it should be Israel. They are a sovereign nation, and they have the right to defend themselves and to protect themselves. They are willing to engage in the peace process, and that takes two sides to comply. Yes, we can cajole people or encourage participation and compliance. We have encouraged participation, but we haven't encouraged compliance. The Palestinians have not complied with the peace process. They have not done what they said they were going to do on several occasions. So the administration should direct their pressure, their leverage, their leadership on the Palestinians, and particularly Mr. Arafat, to comply and stop this snub diplomacy, and diplomacy by dictating, on a plan that is going to be released, what we think is best, regardless of Israel's security needs. 
Mr. President, I hope this administration will have a change in policy, in its attitude, and towards the way it has treated Israel over the last 3 years.

Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I understand that the so-called amendment that has my name on it, the Nickles amendment, to delete $16 million that is in the bill right now to add an additional 65 HCFA employees, is the pending business. 
We debated that significantly yesterday. I am happy to vote on it. I am ready to vote on it. I know Senator Kennedy had a different idea. I do not know what his intentions are, but this Senator is ready to vote, ready to have a time limit, ready to move forward. I think it is important we do so, and do so rather quickly and move on to other business. I know we have the Mexican certification process. So I just make mention of that. 
I see my colleague from Massachusetts is here, so hopefully we will be able to vote on my amendment. If he has an alternative, we are happy to vote on that as well. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I appreciate my colleague's comments. I appreciate his coming to the floor. I think it is important that we have the discussion. We had a significant discussion on this amendment yesterday. I will make a few comments. I understand one other Senator wishes to speak on it, or if the Senator has any additional Senators. 
I mentioned yesterday that HCFA, the Health Care Finance Administration, has over 4,000 employees. That is a lot. Now, the Health and Human Services Department has 58,500 employees. Now, if they need to move a few employees around, they can do it if there is an emergency. There is not really an emergency. Frankly, compliance with HCFA, the so-called Kassebaum-Kennedy bill, which deals with portability, also deals with moving from group to individual plans. Most States have complied. The State of Massachusetts has not complied. But I don't think that we should presume the State of Massachusetts doesn't care about their 
employees or about their people in their State. The State of California hasn't, the State of Missouri hasn't, the State of Michigan hasn't, but every one of those States has pretty advanced policies dealing with health care. 
Now, some would presume because they haven't enacted legislation exactly as we told them to do, that we now need to have Federal regulators go in and run their insurance departments. I do not think that is the case. The Senator from Massachusetts says California has over 1,000 regulators. You cannot do this with 65. You could not do this with 650. You would have to hire thousands if we were going to have the Federal Government come in and regulate State insurance. So that is really something we should not be doing, it would be a serious mistake to do. 
Some people have a real tendency to say if we have any problem, let's go in and have Federal regulators come in and take over. I think that would be a mistake. As I mentioned before, there are over 4,000. Surely they can borrow a few if this is such a critical need. 
A couple people said, `This is needed to enforce the mental parity issue that was passed also as part of the Kassebaum-Kennedy.' It is not. I tell my colleagues, this GAO report that was alluded to by my friend from Massachusetts does not mention mental parity once--not once. I might mention, the request for the supplement from the director of HCFA did not mention mental parity. It was not in their request. What their request was: `Hey, we want to help these five States.' I am saying they can help those five States. They already have 26 employees. They can use additional employees already in the system. We don't need to give them an additional $16 million or $6 million for these 65 employees that cost $93,000 each. That is a lot to pay for somebody in the State of Mississippi or Oklahoma. Our States are in compliance, I might mention; the State of Massachusetts is not in compliance. 
I might also mention two things. The way the Senator pays for this is robbing Medicare. All of us that have been dealing with the appropriations and so on, we know we have discretionary accounts and we have mandatory accounts. Medicare is one of the mandatory accounts. It is paid for. The HI Trust Fund--Hospital Insurance Trust Fund--is paid for by payroll tax; 2.9 percent of all payroll goes into the Hospital Insurance Trust Fund. That ought to be plenty of money. President Clinton had a big increase in 1993, and it is on all income now. It used to be just on the Social Security base up to $68,000. Now it is on all income. 
Guess what. It is still going broke. It is paying out more this year than is coming in. The fund is going broke. Does it make real sense for us to be taking money out of that fund that is dedicated for senior citizens--take money out of the fund to hire more bureaucrats at HCFA? They already have over 4,000, and this says let's hire another 65. The President's budget for next year says he wants another 215. Well, we will wrestle with that in next year's annual appropriations process and let the committees review and discuss it. 
This is an emergency supplemental. This is supposed to be helping communities that are devastated by floods and bad weather and to pay for our forces that had to be on call in Iraq and in Bosnia. What is urgent about this? This is a law that passed. This is a law that became effective--frankly, we passed the law 20 months ago; it only became effective January 1. 
The reason California has not passed a law--California passed a law, but Governor Wilson vetoed it because there are other things in the law he did not think were very good. In Missouri, the Missouri legislature passed a law to be in compliance, but the Governor vetoed it because he had a disagreement. In almost all cases, the five States are not saying, `Federal Government, we want you to regulate us and take over our insurance.' It is because they had a disagreement between the legislative bodies. It is not, they don't want to cover it. It is not, they don't want to give the benefits that we have provided. I think these States do. My guess is, the State of Massachusetts wants to. But for some reason legislatively it has not happened. It may be, again, because there is a different party as Governor, as in the legislative body. 
Sometimes you get some impasses. The solution is not to send an army of HCFA bureaucrats to go in and try to take over regulation of insurance within those five States. That would be a serious mistake. 
So I mention, Mr. President, let's pass this amendment, let's save $16 million, let's not raid the hospital insurance fund. That is the wrong thing to do, a serious mistake. So I urge my colleagues to support the amendment. 
I ask for the regular order.

Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, let me make a couple of quick comments. The initial request that came from HCFA for the $16 million supplemental did not include anything dealing with mental parity; not a word, not a letter, nothing. It didn't include it. The GAO report didn't include it. 
A couple of reasons. Here are the mental parity regulations. If I may have the attention of my colleague from Minnesota for a second. This is a copy of the regs that came in on mental health. Guess when they were announced. December 16, 1997, which was about 3 months ago. How in the world can somebody know 30 States aren't complying? The regs just came out. I heard comments that some States aren't complying with the newborns regulations, the 48 hours. Guess what. Those regs aren't out. The law became effective January 1, and there are no regulations. Yet they want to hire an army of new federal employees. HCFA didn't ask for an army of people to go out and comply with these regulations. 
My colleague alluded to a letter that Senator Kennedy worked hard on, which he probably got late last night, from Nancy Ann Min DeParle, the Administrator of HCFA. I want to read what she says, if I can get my colleague's attention for just a second. I want to read the part of the letter he forgot to read. He left out just a little bit. In the second paragraph of the letter she sent to Senator Kennedy--not to the managers of the bill; she didn't send it to the authorizers of the committee--it might have been written by Senator Kennedy; I'm not sure. But this part certainly wasn't written by Senator Kennedy: 
Moreover, we understand that as many as 30 States may not have standards that comply with Mental Health Parity Act and as many of 10 States may not have standards that comply with the Newborns' and Mothers' Health Protection Act. 
This is what I want you to pay attention to: 
We don't have precise numbers because States are not required to notify HCFA about their intention to implement these two laws. 
HCFA doesn't have control over these two laws. These States aren't told to tell HCFA about compliance with these two laws. Those laws are going to be managed by the Department of Labor. That is not in HCFA's jurisdiction. These 65 people will not spend 1 minute of time on mental parity or the 24 hours or 48 hours for newborns. Some people are trying to create an issue that is not 
real. 
The issue is, very frankly, are we going to spend $16 million to expand the bureaucracy of HCFA? They already have over 4,000 employees and 58,500 at HHS. I have said time and time again, if they need to borrow some of those employees, they can do so. People say, no, we want to expand the base, hire more people, have more intrusion. I have a final comment----

<TEXT>
Mr. NICKLES. Not just yet. I will make a final comment, because this is of interest. Yesterday and today, we have spent several hours debating $16 million. I am trying to save for taxpayers, and basically save it for Medicare, that $16 million that should stay in Medicare. We should not be raiding the Medicare trust funds to pay for an expansion to hire more Federal employees. We are spending several hours on that. I tell my colleague from Texas and my other colleagues, I spent an hour opposing an expansion of $1.9 billion, and I lost. So this Senate expanded the cost of this bill from $3.3 billion to $5.1 billion, and we did it in an hour. Maybe some people are kind of proud of that. I am not proud of it. Yet, to try to cut $16 million, we have spent several hours. 
Some people fight very, very hard to expand Government. I think that is a mistake. I think it is a mistake in this bill. It should not be in this bill. When my colleague read the letters, he didn't read all of the letters. It says that HCFA doesn't have enforcement authority over these two bills, and it doesn't have anything to do with the legislation that is before us. I happen to have enough confidence in the State of Massachusetts, the State of California, the State of Michigan, the State of Missouri, and Rhode Island. They care about their people just as much as we do in Washington, DC. Hiring another army of bureaucrats to go in and tell them what to do will not, in my opinion, improve the quality of health care in those States.

Mr. NICKLES. I will be happy to answer the Senator's question. The regulations I was waving around a moment ago--this thing--came out on December 16, 3 months ago. I doubt that all the States have had time to review these regulations. Maybe some of them have, and maybe some of them haven't. So how would anyone know whether all the States are in compliance with that? On the newborns law my colleague alluded to, which is not enforced by HCFA, the regs aren't out yet. So how could anyone know whether or not there is compliance? 
Now, the 65 people that HCFA was requesting in the supplemental were not to enforce either the mental parity or the 48 hours for newborns. It was not in the request, not in their letter, not in the GAO study. 
I think my colleague makes an interesting diversion in trying to say that they should be doing this, too. But frankly, that is not their responsibility. It is the responsibility of the Department of Labor. It is not in this bill and it would not be helped by passing this supplemental, even as originally requested.

Mr. NICKLES. I thank my colleague. 
I urge my colleagues to vote no on this amendment because we are still raiding Medicare, we are still taking money out of Medicare. I will take a little issue. 
My colleagues said, `Oh, those Republicans, just a couple years ago, they were trying to cut $276 billion out of Medicare to pay for the tax cuts.' In the budget deal that passed that the President signed, we had exactly--exactly--the same savings in Medicare over the same number of years that the President signed that he vetoed 2 years before. 
One year, last year, he said, `Oh, yes, we saved Medicare for 10 years'--we didn't, in my opinion--but it is the exact same savings in dollars that he vetoed 2 years before. I just make that comment. 
What we are doing now is raiding Medicare, raiding the HI fund, taking money from the peer review organizations that are supposed to make the fund work better, make sure it is not abused, get some of the fraud out of the system. We are taking that out so we can hire more bureaucrats. 
Now we are only going to hire half as many. Instead of hiring 65, I guess we are going to hire maybe 32 or 33 for an agency that already has over 4,000. 
Senator Gramm mentioned, hey, if they want to, they can borrow some of those 4,000. This administration has been pretty good about borrowing attorneys. They have attorneys from every agency coming in to help with the President's legal defense fund. They do that a lot. 
The previous administration had six people in legal counsel. Now they have 24, and one report is 48. So, surely, they could borrow a few people from HCFA with 4,000 employees to help meet this so-called `urgent need.' 
So, whether we are talking about $16 million or whether we are talking about $8 million, I think it is a mistake to expand this bureaucracy, and that is exactly what we would be doing, intruding and basically telling the State of Massachusetts--the State of Massachusetts has not complied yet. I don't know why they have not. There may be a good reason. 
The State of California has not because the Governor vetoed the bill. I don't know how many armies of bureaucrats we need from the Federal Government to go in and tell the Governor of California he should sign this bill or veto the bill, or the Governor in Missouri or the Governor in Massachusetts. I just don't think that is really what we need. 
I will tell my colleagues, if it is ready to regulate these plans, you don't need 65; you need hundreds--you need hundreds--and that wasn't what we passed in Kassebaum-Kennedy. We said we were going to keep State jurisdiction and State control and regulation of health care. 
I urge my colleagues to vote against this second-degree amendment that will add, basically, to my amendment $8 million for a new bureaucracy of HCFA. I don't think we need it, I don't think we can afford it, and I don't think we should be raiding Medicare to pay for it. 
I reserve the remainder of my time.

Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, in a moment I am going to move to table the amendment. But let me make a couple comments. 
My colleague from Massachusetts is entitled to his own opinion but not entitled to his own facts. And the facts are that to pay for this, it takes money out of the HI Trust Fund that is used to pay for peer review organizations. So it is cutting money out of Medicare to pay for this. 
I read the letters by some of the support groups--some of which I consider supporters of mine--that have said, `Let's oppose this amendment. We want more money for HCFA bureaucrats or HCFA enforcement.' But they did not know the money was coming out of Medicare. I read almost every one of them. Not one said, `Let's transfer the money from the HI Trust Fund to pay for more employees at the Health Care Financing Administration.' And so it is coming from Medicare. It is coming from oversight on peer review organizations. We should not do that. 
So, Mr. President, I move to table the Kennedy amendment and ask for the yeas and nays.

Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, today I am prompted to speak by both a tragic reality, and also what I would think is a promising hope. The tragic reality is that literally millions of religious believers around the world live gripped by the incessant, terrifying prospect of persecution, of being tortured, arrested, imprisoned or even killed for simply practicing their faith. A promising hope, I believe, might perhaps be found in the bill that I am introducing today with Senator Lieberman, Senator Mack, Senator Kempthorne, Senator Craig, Senator Hutchinson and Senator DeWine. It is called the International Religious Freedom Act. The International Religious Freedom Act will establish a process to ensure that on an ongoing basis the United States closely monitors religious persecution worldwide. 
It is wrong for a country to persecute, to prosecute, to imprison, harass individuals for simply practicing their faith, whether that faith is Jewish or Christian or Muslim or Hindu. It is absolutely wrong for them to be persecuted for practicing their faith. This act requires the U.S. Government to take action against all countries engaging in religious persecution. 
What kind of persecution am I talking about? First, three facts command attention. 
One reliable estimate indicates that more Christian martyrs have perished in this century than all previous centuries combined. That is a staggering, staggering statement. 
A recent book reports that 200 million Christians around the world live under daily fear and threat of persecution, including interrogation, imprisonment, torture and in some cases death. 
Finally, over half the world's population lives under regimes which severely restrict if not prohibit their ability to believe in and practice the religious faith of their choice and conviction. 
Of course, religious persecution goes beyond facts and figures. It happens to real people in real places. Let me point out just four compelling examples. 
At this very moment one of China's leading house church pastors, Pastor Peter Xu, is languishing in a Chinese prison under a 3-year term for the so-called `crime' of `disturbing public order.' Hundreds, perhaps thousands of other believers in China currently suffer similar treatment. 
Again, at this very moment, 13 courageous Christians are imprisoned by the Communist authorities in Laos. What was their `crime'? Simply that they organized an `unauthorized' Bible study in the privacy of a home. 
In Pakistan, just a few months ago, Pastor Noor Alam was brutally stabbed to death by anti-Christian assailants. Shortly before that, they had destroyed Pastor Alam's church building. Meanwhile, Christians and other religious minorities in Pakistan continue to sufferer under the notorius `blasphemy laws.' 
Or consider Russia, which, as many of my colleagues will remember, just last summer passed a draconian law that will effectively shut down the vast majority of independent churches and other religious organizations and severly curtail the religious freedom of the Russian people. 
I could go on and on. However, I do want to share just a few highlights of what we humbly but earnestly hope our bill can do to begin to address the scourge of religious persecution worldwide. 
I should also mention that, in 1996, I was honored to sponsor a Senate resolution on religious persecution, which passed by unanimous consent. In that resolution, the Senate made a strong recommendation `that the President expand and invigorate the United States' international advocacy on behalf of persecuted Christians, and initiate a thorough examination of all United States' policies that affect persecuted Christians.' 
What was a mere resolution in 1996, I hope it will become a reality in 1998. While then we acted with words, I hope that this year we can act with deeds. 
In short, this bill seeks to ensure that the U.S. Government aggressively monitors religious oppression around the world and takes decisive action against those regimes engaged in persecution, all the while maintaining the integrity and credibility of the U.S. foreign policy system. 
The International Religious Freedom Act establishes an `Ambassador-at-Large for Religious Liberty' at the State Department. The Ambassador will be responsible for representing our Government in vigorous diplomacy with nations guilty of religious persecution. In addition, the Ambassador will oversee an annual report on religious persecution which will specify the details on religious persecution around the world. This report will name names. And those countries named will be held accountable. 
For any country cited in the report, the Act presents a menu of diplomatic and economic options, and the President is required to select from at least one of those actions. Silence or passivity are not options. At the same time, the Act seeks to provide the President maximum flexibility entailing the most appropriate, effective response to that particular situation in a particular country. Furthermore, because we desire good results to follow our good intentions, the Act requires a consideration of how the action taken by America will affect American economic and security interests and, most important, how it will affect the very people that it purports to help. 
The International Religious Freedom Act has other provisions--improved reporting, improved training for immigration and foreign service officials, a commission on international religious liberty to provide more attention and expertise on the issue. I invite all my colleagues, and certainly those who are deeply concerned about the plight of persecuted religious believers, to join me in supporting this bill. Not because it might be popular or expedient or convenient to support this legislation, but because it is the right thing to do and because I believe it will make a real difference in protecting the lives of some of the most vulnerable people in the world, those people who wish to express their religious beliefs and convictions. 
Mr. President, I thank my cosponsors, particularly Senator Lieberman, also Senator Mack, in addition to Senator Hutchinson and Senator Craig and Senator Kempthorne, for helping us put this legislation together.

Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation that would prohibit the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) from establishing regulations that would compel broadcasters to offer free or reduced cost air time to political candidates. 
It is clear that this type of regulation would result in drastic change to current communications and campaign finance law and thus, exceed the regulatory authority of this agency. Absent a legislative directive from Congress, the FCC lacks the authority to require broadcasters to offer free or reduced-cost air time for political candidates. 
While in many areas of broadcast regulation, the FCC does possess broad authority to change its regulation to reflect what is within the public interest, that authority has always been specifically granted by an act of Congress. This broad authority does NOT extend to the regulation of political broadcasting. 
The Communications Act clearly mandates, with respect to candidate appearances on broadcasting stations, certain specific requirements for FCC to enforce on broadcasters for political candidates. The law requires broadcasters to provide candidates with equal opportunities, ensure that there is no censorship of political messages, and provide `reasonable access' to federal candidates. As for media rates, the Act specifically states that when candidates buy air time, they will be accorded a stations' `lowest unit charge' for the same class and amount of time. 
It seems quite clear that Congress' inclusion of these specific provisions indicates that in the area of political broadcasting, 
especially for rates charged for advertising, the FCC does not have the authority to rewrite the Communications Act and impose a free political time requirement which is inconsistent with Congress' specific statement on this issue. 
Any attempt to affect campaign finance reform through overreaching FCC regulations rather than through the legislative process, regardless of good intentions, is wrong. Any changes or revisions to the campaign finance or communication laws should be made by the people through their elected representatives and not by non elected federal bureaucrats. New regulations from the FCC would further involve the government in protected political speech areas and create a patchwork of agency regulations without any consistent overall reform. 
Mr. President, during the 105th Congress this body has thoroughly debated campaign reform and free air time for political candidates. Clearly there is not enough support in this body to pass legislation that includes the free air time provisions. This legislative defeat does not give the FCC Chairman the authority, even with direction from the President, to issue regulations giving candidates free time and mandate or bribe the nation's broadcasters to abide by these regulations. Again, if this type of reform is to be implemented, it requires legislative action by Congress. It is not appropriate for a federal agency to mandate this comprehensive reform by regulatory action. 
The Constitution is very clear. Article I, Section 1 of the Constitution vests in Congress all power to `make laws which shall be used necessary and proper for carrying into Execution the foregoing Powers * * *'. Nowhere in the Constitution is the Executive Branch vested with the power to make the law. The framers of the Constitution understood the threat to our freedom which could be posed by an all-powerfull executive branch. This principle is as valid today as it was when they drafted the Constitution. Any proposed regulations by the FCC which would require broadcasters to give free or reduced-cost air time to federal political candidates raises serious constitutional concerns. 
This is not the first time that the Clinton administration has tried to bypass Congress and legislate by Executive order. They have attempted to do this on several occasions. And I think they have done so knowing full well they could not get their desired objective through Congress. 
Let me remind the FCC, that if this type of regulatory action is taken by this agency, I will lead the effort in the Senate to defeat the regulation. The Congressional Review Act, gives Congress the ability to disapprove regulations, when a simple majority believes that the regulation is inappropriate. 
Every member of this body, Democrats and Republicans, should reject this approach. We should uphold and protect this institution, the legislative branch, and the constitution. 
And so, Mr. President, I have warned the White House that I am willing to use any appropriate tools at our disposal to stop this egregious abuse of power. I will do what I can to stop the proposed FCC regulations on air time for political candidates. And I will do what I can to block any other attempts by this administration to legislate by executive action. It is my intention to use everything in my power to protect this institution. I am hopeful that my colleagues will join me in this effort.

Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, for the information of my colleagues, the amendment I am offering today will strike a nonemergency appropriation of $16 million for the Health Care Financing Administration, commonly called HCFA. This provision in the supplemental bill includes $6 million for HCFA to hire 65 new Federal employees. That is an average of $92,300 per person. Mr. President, I will try to be very blunt and very quick with my discussion on this amendment. 
HCFA has today 4,002 employees. It is unbelievably large, and some would say not a very well-run agency. It has an administrative function that spends $364 million. Its total program management is $1.88 billion and it has been growing significantly. 
The administration in their budget request says next year they want to hire an additional 215 employees, an increase in their Federal administrative request from $364 million to $456 million. This is an agency that has been growing and, under the administration's request, would continue to grow profusely. It doesn't need to be in this so-called emergency supplemental bill. The administration requested it, and it was initially agreed upon. 
But I started looking at the request, and I am astounded that it would be made. Supposedly, the request was made to fund HCFA's enforcement of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, the so-called Kassebaum-Kennedy bill that we passed last Congress. This provision would hire an additional 65 bureaucrats. They now have 26 administering the program. Forty-five States have already complied. This is temporary assuming all 50 States are going to comply. Twenty-six employees were able to help monitor compliance and help achieve compliance within 45 States. Five States have not. All five States, I believe, will at some point be in compliance. 
Do we really need to hire an additional 65 and expand this bureaucracy? I don't think that we should. I think we should save the taxpayers the $16 million. 
One of the things that bothers me is how we are paying for this. This is paid for by taking money out of a function that is paid for in the Medicare trust fund. So we are taking money out of entitlement functions and putting it in discretionary funds so we can hire more bureaucrats. HCFA already has over 4,000. I really do not think we need another 65, especially in an emergency supplemental bill. 
So my amendment would be to delete this amendment to the bill that would add $16 million in new federal spending, and I urge my colleagues to support it.

Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I appreciate the statement of my colleague from Minnesota, but he is absolutely wrong. Let me just tell my colleague from Minnesota, the administration did not request a dime dealing with mental health parity--not a dime, I tell my friend from New Mexico. 
Let's go back to the legislation, the original legislation---- 
</TEXT>

<DOC>
<DOCNO>105-nickles-ok-6-19980325</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
Mr. NICKLES. Let me just complete my response. I think I will answer my colleague's statement. 
The Senator from Minnesota says if we do not fund this money we are jeopardizing mental parity enforcement, and he is absolutely wrong--absolutely wrong. I want to make sure people understand it. The reason why Kassebaum-Kennedy had a lot of support is because it provided major reforms to improve access and portability, to make sure if somebody loses insurance in a group plan they can have access to coverage in an individual plan. I supported that. But we left it under State regulation. We gave States the authority to regulate this. Mr. President, 45 States have stepped forward. We passed that bill 20 months ago. The bill became effective, I tell my colleague, in January of this year. It has only been in effect for 2 1/2 months. 45 States now comply; 45 States have done what we asked them to do. They have amended their State laws, because States regulate insurance. 
I know a lot of people in this body would like the Federal Government to regulate all insurance, but a lot of us said no, we should keep that under State control, we should let the States do it. We are not insurance commissioners. And needs may vary from State to State. Some people wanted to nationalize it. They have not been successful. They were not successful when they passed the so-called Kennedy-Kassebaum legislation in federalizing insurance. 
What the bill did say is: States, make these changes. Make sure insurance in your State is portable. Make sure there are options to go to individual plans if they lose coverage under a group plan. We passed that unanimously in the Senate. Mr. President, 45 States have adopted it. The law became effective January 1 this year. It has only been in effect for 2 1/2 months. To help the States make that transition, HCFA had 26 employees--26. Forty-five States now comply. The other five States, as I understand it, are still working on it, and maybe they have had a disagreement between the Governor and the legislature or one body in the House or the Senate, and so they have not passed legislation in their State to be in compliance. So they are working on it. 
But wait a minute. Do we need to hire a whole new army? Do we need to go from 26 employees and add another 65 on top of it, creating a whole new big base or army of HCFA employees to get 
these 5 States to comply? I do not think so. I think it would be a serious mistake. And it has absolutely nothing to do with mental health parity. 
I look at the administration's HCFA supplemental request; it doesn't mention mental health parity. It doesn't have anything to do with mental health parity. Those are all under the State plans. So I just mention that. I want to make sure my colleagues understand that. 
Let me now just touch on a couple of other things. Senator Kennedy mentioned that GAO came up with a report.

Mr. NICKLES. He said this GAO report mentioned there was widespread abuse and so on, and I take issue with that. The GAO report says this, and I will just quote: 
HHS regulatory role under this law is not yet known. Some implementation challenges may soon recede. Others are hypothetical and may not materialize. As Federal agencies issue more guidance and States and insurers gain more experience with HCFA, concerns about the clarity of its regulations may diminish. 
In other words, we have 45 States now in compliance, according to HCFA; 5 are in the process of working on it, and maybe those 5 will never get it together. Then maybe there will have to be some Federal implementation of Kassebaum-Kennedy, but that remains to be seen; we don't know. This has only been in effect for 2 1/2 months. So, do we really have an emergency of such a magnitude that we must triple the staff for HCFA so these five States can get in compliance? Those five States may sign up within the next month, or the next 2 months. So there is no reason to hire 65 people. There is no reason whatsoever, at $92,000 each--or an average cost of $92,000. I don't think it makes sense. 
Does HCFA have some other alternatives? Yes; they have over 4,000 employees. Do we really need to give them 65 more in this so-called urgent supplemental? HHS has a total of 58,500 employees--58,000 employees. Do we really need to give them an extra 65? I don't think so. I mean, this administration has shown a great ability to be able to borrow employees from agency to agency. The Legal Counsel's Office in the White House seems to borrow quite a few from various agencies to help in their legal battles that they have ongoing in the White House. They can move employees within HHS, they can move employees within HCFA, to meet with any temporary demand that is there. This is a temporary demand. You only have five States in noncompliance. They may be in compliance by this summer. So why in the world would we need to hire 65 additional bureaucrats that would be permanent, that would be added on forever, that would be looking for other things? 
I might mention, we even found a list from HCFA that says what these people will be doing after these five States are in compliance. I might tell my colleague from Minnesota, it doesn't have anything to do with mental health parity but it is `review all State legislation'--it has a bunch of things that they would be doing. In other words, more bureaucrats, more Federal intervention over State law. That is not what we passed in Kassebaum-Kennedy. 
My colleague from Minnesota was successful, with the Senator from New Mexico. They said, we want to have mental health parity. That passed as part of Kennedy-Kassebaum, but I tell my colleague, dealing with Federal legislation, it only would deal with the Labor Department on ERISA plans. It has nothing to do with State regulation of plans. We do not send out an army of bureaucrats to set out and micromanage insurance throughout the States. Maybe that is what some in this administration would like to do. I hope we will not do it. I hope we will have the wisdom to say we will not give them this additional money for 65 employees. They have 26, and 45 States signed up--45 States in the last 20 months signed up. Do we really need to give them an additional 65 employees in hopes that maybe they will be able to run the 
insurance programs of the 5 States that haven't yet signed up? I don't think so. 
This is an urgent supplemental. This is an abuse of the process, I think, by HCFA, to expand their bureaucracy, and I think it would be a serious mistake. So I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.

Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I beg to differ with my colleague. The original legislation set up said: States, do these things. We told the States to do them, and 45 States have done them. This is a temporary -- temporary -- encouragement to get the States to have portability. We did it; 45 States have done it. This was not to have HCFA micromanage State insurance plans throughout the land. That was not why this bill was passed. If they could not do that with 26 employees, then I would be surprised if they could do it with 65 employees. 
Some people are trying to take a bill that passed unanimously and say that gives us great authority to be able to micromanage all the health care plans in the States. That is not what we passed. That is not what we agreed to. What we told the States to do was put in portability and put in conversions, where you could convert to an individual plan. We did that; 45 States said yes; 5 still have not. That is temporary. Even the GAO report that was quoted by my colleague from Massachusetts said--he was quoting that report where the director who made the report said we may not have this need. We don't even know, because those five States may be in compliance, and once they sign up, we are done, they are done. 
My colleague is talking about mental parity. The States have that in their plans if they are complying. That is a State regulatory function, it is not ours, where the Federal Government has an involvement to tell my colleague under an ERISA plan, that's 
enforced under the Department of Labor. It is not under HCFA. HCFA did not ask for that, because it is not under their domain, their jurisdiction. I don't want people to be confused and say this may hinder mental health parity enforcement. It does not. It doesn't have a thing to do with that. 
What this whole legislation is about is getting the States to comply with HIPAA, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act. Mr. President, 45 States have done that; 5 are in the process, working on it. They have done that with 26 employees. This is a measure to say we need another 65, and incidentally, when they finish this, we will have them doing something else. This is a massive effort to expand the bureaucracy of an agency that already spends $364 million, has 4,000 employees. 
I might mention, the administration wants to increase that next year by about $80 million, just in administration function, and increase that by another 215 employees. We will have to wrestle with that in next year's appropriation bill, which will just be another few months from now. But what we have on the floor now is the so-called urgent supplemental that the administration tried to stick in the back-door to expand their bureaucracy. They want to use this urgent supplemental as an excuse to expand the bureaucracy when there is nothing urgent. 
I think if you have a bill that passed 20 months ago and you have 45 States in compliance and the bill has only been in effect 2 1/2 months and there are 5 remaining, there is no reason to almost triple the bureaucracy to be able to get those 5 States to comply. That is what we are talking about. That is a temporary need, and surely HCFA, with 4,000 employees, if they need a couple more employees, can borrow a couple of those employees out of that 4,000. I mean the 26 that are already working in this one branch, they still have 3,970-some-odd that they could use, that they could borrow. They can borrow a couple of people. 
Or there is something like almost 60,000 people in Health and Human Services--60,000 employees. Maybe they could borrow a couple of those. We don't need to permanently fund an additional 65 employees to expand this bureaucracy.

Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, just for the information of my colleagues, I think we are winding down. Just a couple comments. 
HCFA is not a starved agency. This is not an agency that has been ignored by this Congress in last year's appropriations bill. Last year, in 1997, we spent $1.77 billion in HCFA. In 1998, this year we are in, $1.88 billion. I tell my colleagues, that is $110 million, and an increase of $30 million just in the administrative portion of HCFA alone. 
And the number of full-time employees, I have mentioned before, is over 4,000--4,000. So this is not an agency that has been starved. If you ask anybody in the medical community, anybody in a hospital, HCFA is a disaster. It takes 10 years sometimes to promulgate regulations. I do not think there is a direct relationship between increasing an agency's budget and improving the quality of health care for families. 
My colleague from Massachusetts said, `Boy, if we don't give them more money, we're going to have bad quality health care in various States.' I do not think there is a direct correlation between an increase in HCFA's budget for bureaucrats and improving quality health care. 
It may be just the opposite. It may be that a lot of those bureaucrats, instead of increasing the quality health care, frankly, cause a lot more headache, a lot more paperwork, a lot more compliance costs and less quality health care. And so is this urgent? 
Now, the administration has a big request in 1999. And we are going to fight that on the appropriations bill. I am sure they have asked for $80 million in new money. They have asked for another 217 employees. Now they are trying to squeeze in an extra 65. I do not think we should do it. I do not think we should do it. It is not that big of a deal, but, hey, do we want to turn that much additional bureaucracy over to HCFA, that much more money, or can't they borrow some more of those employees that they now have who are probably reading through reports that are obsolete and maybe not doing so much good? 
Sixty-five happens to be about 1.5 percent of their work force. Surely, they can borrow a few employees if they have this urgent request to get these five States in compliance. Heaven forbid, five States. It is 2 1/2 months, and they have not stepped up to do what we told them to do. 
Now, does that mean those States do not care about quality health care? I do not think so. Maybe they have not passed the bill in their legislatures, but, all right, let us borrow some employees from HCFA. Maybe that can encourage this process. But do we really need to hire 65 more when 26 were doing this function for the first 20 months? Do we really need to hire an additional 65? That is an increase of 250 percent, when you only have basically five States that have not complied when GAO says that 
HHS' regulatory role under this law is not yet known. Some implementation challenges may soon recede. Others are hypothetical and may not materialize. And yet we are going to more than double the number of bureaucrats dealing with this? I do not think that makes sense. 
And then, Mr. President, I want to touch on--and I have the Budget Committee chairman here and the Appropriations Committee chairman here. I want to touch on how this was paid for. Now, this is supposedly an urgent supplemental. I know on occasion--I know on the highway bill we are going to make a change on an entitlement program to help pay for the entitlement program, and most everybody signed off on it. Maybe that is good; maybe it is not good. 
But the way we are paying for this, I tell my colleague from Minnesota, we are taking money out of the Hospital Insurance Fund. We are taking money out of an entitlement program, mandated program, that is supposed to be dealing with quality health care. We are taking money away from that program and saying, well, we want to spend it in an urgent supplemental and money going out this year. Now, we only have a few months left this year. The HI, the Hospital Insurance Fund, happens to have some problems. Its problems are that more money is going out than going in. And so now we are all of a sudden saying--and this portion of it deals with peer review organizations, and so on. We are supposed to be implementing quality, supposed to be improving quality for seniors, and we are going to say, `Oh, no, we're going to take money out of that. We'll take enough money out of that to pay for this.' 
We are taking money out of the entitlement side to pay on the discretionary side, and further compound the problems we have in the Medicare trust fund. I just do not think that makes sense. I do not think it is right. I told the chairman of the Finance Committee we should not do this. I have heard people say we are going to protect the Medicare fund and we are going to protect seniors and we are going to have quality health care for seniors, and the next thing you know, well, we are playing games on HI, on the Hospital Insurance Fund, so we can get more bureaucrats for HCFA. 
I do not think we can do it. If HCFA has the need, they have 4,002 employees. The can borrow, they can get by, they can make sure they can make it happen. They have a total of 58,000 employees in their whole organization. Health and Human Services has 58,500 employees. Maybe they could borrow one or two of those. They could borrow 1 percent of those. My land, 58,000--1 percent would be 580. Do we really need that? I do not think so. 
So I just urge my colleagues to vote no on expanding bureaucracy. Let us allow some common sense and some fiscal discipline to happen for a change. Let us not be taking money out of an organization that is supposed to be improving quality health care for seniors and further jeopardizing the Hospital Insurance Fund at the same time.

Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, for the information of our colleagues, I think we are very close to concluding debate on this amendment. 
I want to thank my colleague from Vermont, and my colleague from New Mexico and others who have spoken on behalf of this amendment. I also share his concern. If there are going to be that number of employees in HCFA, it should be temporary. I very much appreciate that. 
I also mention that my friend and colleague from Massachusetts said that Oklahoma had recently hired five employees to comply with this provision. I think that is fine. I think that is great, because I happen to believe in State control of insurance instead of the Federal Government. States are trying to comply. They are in the process of complying. The State of Oklahoma can probably hire five employees for less than $93,000 each, as we would be doing under this piece of legislation. 
So, again, for the information of our colleagues, my amendment would strike out the provision that would add $16 million for HCFA for the hiring of an additional 65 employees. I do not think that is necessary. They have over 4,000 employees today. They certainly can borrow, they can use, they can have temporary employees. They do not need 65 permanent employees. 
We also do not need to be taking money away from the Medicare's Hospital Insurance Trust Fund, a permanent entitlement provision, to pay for this measure. 
Again, the administration was well aware. The Health and Human Services Administration has 58,000 employees. Surely they can shuffle some employees around, if necessary, to meet any emergency that might arise. 
So I urge my colleagues to vote for this amendment. 
I ask for the yeas and nays.

Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, yesterday Senator Gramm had an amendment that said let's fund the 1998 emergencies and we will call it an emergency; we don't have to have an offset. That was the underlying bill. The underlying bill had money for defense, money for Iraq, money for Bosnia, money for the so-called emergencies--weather-related emergencies. I thought he had a good amendment. I did not speak out on the floor, and I wish I had. That was on the underlying bill, which is about $3.3 billion. Now we are looking at an amendment to expand that bill by an additional $1.6 billion. I ask the Senator from Missouri, is that correct--$1.6 billion for FEMA? 
</TEXT>

<DOCNO>105-nickles-ok-15-19980325</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
Mr. NICKLES. The reason I ask the question is because I have heard this figure bandied around the last few days. But anyway, FEMA did not request any money initially. This is a late request. This is a late request, and the Senators from Missouri or Alaska can correct me if I am wrong, this request did not come in from the administration when they were marking up the bill; this request just came in lately: `Oh, we need an additional $1.6 billion for disasters that we think might happen. And, oh, yes, we want to call it an emergency.' 
What does that mean? By calling it an emergency means there will be no offsets. These emergencies have not happened yet, but we are basically going to take this $1.6 billion, and most of the money, I might mention, will be spent in 1999 and the year 2000, maybe 2001. The money is going to be spent in the future, but, `Oh, we don't have to put that in the budget.' 
I am on the Budget Committee, and we had an agreement. The President signed that agreement, and he said, `Here's how much money we are going to spend on discretionary accounts,' and we passed it. The President in his State of the Union Address bragged about how good that is: `Boy, now we have a balanced budget. We are going to have a balanced budget for a long time because we worked together.' 
Well, this is voiding that agreement. This is saying, let's take $1.6 billion for the future and we are going to call it an emergency and, therefore, we don't have to have any offsets--none. It is just going to come out of, I guess, the surplus. 
Guess what? The budget that we are going to be considering next week talks about the surplus. Senator Domenici did a very good job in working it through. Guess how much the surplus is in the year 2000 when probably most of this money would be spent. The surplus is $1 billion. And we are working on an emergency supplemental, if we adopt this amendment, which will be over $5 billion and probably a couple billion of that will be spent in the year 2000. In other words, certainly if we adopt this amendment, we are going to be spending 100 percent of the surplus in 2 years. And we are spending real money. 
I just don't think we should do it. If FEMA wants to ask for this money, it should be in their budget. They come before the appropriators. Senator Bond does a very capable job in that subcommittee. They can come up and say, `Here is the historical average; therefore, we should have a couple billion dollars a year in FEMA for our budget.' They have not done that. What they are really trying to do is, `Hey, we want to get around the budget.' 
In other words, we have a cap on discretionary spending but we are not going to include FEMA, like it doesn't count, even though we have historical averages. 
I do not think we should prefund the account and call it an emergency. If we want to prefund it, fine. I am just saying we should take the emergency designation off. We should not declare it an emergency; it has not happened. Frankly, if we have an emergency in 3 months, FEMA will not be able to spend the money until the year 1999, and we won't have an appropriations bill. Let's go through the appropriations process.

<TEXT>
Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, the essence of this amendment, I tell my colleagues, is it says that we allow the money to go in for an additional amount for disaster relief, $1.6 billion to remain available until expended, period. What I am deleting is the emergency. The additional part of this amendment says that I am deleting `provided these funds will be available only to the extent the official budget request for a specific amount includes the designation of the entire amount of the request as an emergency requirement defined in the Balanced Budget Emergency Control Act of 1985,' and so on. 
In other words, I am striking the emergency section of this request. So we can put the money in. If there is an emergency, by golly, FEMA has the money; it can pay it. So nobody should say, `Hey, you took money away from my emergency.' 
What it does mean is, in the budget next year we are going to have to include whatever portion of that $1.6 billion would be spent in 1999 in the budget. We have caps to spend about $580 billion, I am going to guess, next year in the discretionary accounts. This is going to have to be part of it, or, in the year 2000, this will be part of it. This means we still may be able to have a surplus in 2002. It means maybe our budgets mean something. 
How in the world can you have a budget and say we are going to have caps on discretionary spending and then we say, `Oh, we're going to fund in advance future emergencies, and, oh, yes, we're not going to count that as part of the budget and it's not necessary to affect the caps'? 
Domestic total discretionary spending increased from $274 billion in 1997 to $288 billion in 1998. That is more than a 5 percent increase, and that is for the year we are in right now. All I am saying is if we are going to future fund FEMA, it ought to be in the budget. 
I do not object to adding $1.6 billion so FEMA will have the money, and if there is an emergency this year, they can pay for it; if there is an emergency next year, they can pay for it. But what I am objecting to is having it classified as an emergency in advance so there have to be no offsets. 
I just think that if we are going to be spending next year in total discretionary spending, that it should be included and get away from this game of, `Oh, we're only going to fund a few couple hundred million dollars in FEMA, and, oh, yes, if an emergency comes up, we will just declare an emergency and it doesn't count.' I do not want to spend 100 percent of the surplus in 2000 on this bill. I think that is a serious mistake. 
I urge my colleagues to allow the funding to go forward for FEMA, but let's strike the emergency section of this bill so in the future years it will have to be paid for. We will have to incorporate that in our total amount of spending so that our budget will mean something; so a budget that we are going to be working very hard and probably have several contentious and tough votes on, probably a good debate on in the next few days, will mean something. 
It is a heck of a deal for people to be saying, `Oh, yes, we're fighting for a balanced budget; oh, we can waive the budget, we can waive it in the future, we don't have to budget for emergencies.' We should budget for emergencies. We should have truth in budgeting. We should say, `Hey, this should be included and it shouldn't be exempt from the budget.' 
I did not say anything about the $3.3 billion. I think Senator Gramm was right yesterday, but we did not touch that. Certainly if we are going to take it from $3.3 billion to over $5 billion, which is what we are getting ready to do--we started with an appropriations request from the administration that started around $2 billion, and the administration keeps sending amendments up: `Oh, yes, now we have a little amendment; we want another $300 billion, some $260 billion, I think, for community block development grants,' that was just adopted. `Now we have another little amendment, $1.6 billion for FEMA; `oh, yeah, we would like that, too.' 
They did not give us that request when we had the markup. They did not give us that request 2 weeks ago. But all of a sudden, they just determined a new need. The reason they determined a new need, in my opinion, is they said, `Hey, if this is an emergency, this will give us more money to spend next year for other purposes.' I think that is wrong. 
I think it is a serious mistake. 
So I urge my colleagues to adopt our second-degree amendment and strike the emergency portion of this future funding for FEMA.

<TEXT>
Mr. NICKLES. Madam President, I appreciate the comments of both my friends and colleagues. I had the pleasure of serving on this subcommittee with them. They do an outstanding job. 
Let me make a couple of comments. Is this an emergency? I don't think so. I have been informed that the administration requested this $1.6 billion yesterday. Wait, these disasters have happened for the last several months. They requested this yesterday. Gravy train. 
The Senate is in the process of moving an appropriations bill, and they are calling it an emergency bill. If the Senate was having `pay fors,' which we probably should do, they wouldn't be doing this, in my estimate. Maybe I am wrong. I know in the past this committee has already made some changes on section 8 to pay for it. I compliment them for that. 
I am not faulting my colleagues on this subcommittee. I am faulting the Senate, I am faulting the Budget Committee, because we have gotten this historical, sloppy budgeteering process for FEMA that we will be funding at $300 million a year when it averages $2 billion or $3 billion a year. 
I agree entirely with my colleagues from both Missouri and Maryland. They say we need to reform the FEMA funding process. That is exactly right. Maybe now that I have had a chance to look at it, I can help you with that. Let us give it a little attention. We need to give it attention. This is ridiculous. 
For my colleagues who think we are budgeting and we are real serious next week, we are serious, except for when we happen to call something an emergency. This wasn't an emergency 2 days ago, but it is an emergency now. So here is another $1.6 billion. We just had an emergency, too. We are going to add $260 million on community development block grants. 
Let me read something from the committee report on community development block grants. I was going to oppose both. The vote will be the same. This is from the committee report, and I compliment the authors. 
The committee remains concerned about the Department of Housing and Urban Development's administration of $500 million in emergency community development block grant funding which was provided in fiscal year 1997, Emergency Supplemental Act, public law 105-18, June 12, 1997, last year's urgent supplemental. This was an unprecedented amount of emergency community block development grant funding and it raised a number of concerns regarding inadequate award procedures and accountability measures. Despite repeated requests by the committee, HUD has provided little or no data regarding the funding procedures for emergency CDBG funds for the amounts of CDBG funds allocated by HUD to the States and localities by the amount or activity. It is expected that by April 15, 1998, HUD will provide a summary of the procedures used for allocating and awarding emergency CDBG funds, a summary of all waivers made, and a list of all grants by State, locality and activity. 
I compliment them for doing it. But the net essence is last year we gave community development block grants $500 million in emergency funds, and HUD can't account for it. We added $260 million this year, and in addition we are adding $1.6 billion. In a period now we are going to spend $1.9 billion, call it emergency, and say none has to be counted as discretionary spending under the 
budget. Almost all of this money will be spent in 1999 and the year 2000, probably 100 percent of it, yet it is off budget, it doesn't count. 
Every penny of that is coming out of the surplus, every single penny. I heard the President, `We will save that surplus for protecting Social Security'--except for what he calls an emergency. And we have a supplemental bill going through and it has emergency designation. Let's pile on, let's add some more money, add $1.6 billion, make it $1.9 billion. 
They gave us that request yesterday, and we are going to submit to it. The managers of this bill will probably win and so we are going to spend probably 100 percent of the surplus in the year 2000 in this bill on this amendment. The year 2000, the Budget Committee did good work, but we have a $1 billion surplus forecasted for the year 2000--$1 billion--and we are going to spend it because we are calling it an emergency. 
All I am saying, is that it is not an emergency. Those funds should be allocated and should be under the caps. We should pay for it. I want to pay for emergencies as much as anybody else in this room, but we should put it in the budget. This is a fraud on the whole budget process to say emergency spending, we are not going to count that for the future years.

Mr. NICKLES. To respond to my friend and colleague from New Hampshire, who also serves on the Budget Committee, he is exactly right. The President said we wanted to save every penny of the surplus for Social Security, and right now we getting ready to spend it. 
My amendment, I might remind my colleague from New Hampshire who has had some disaster, and several other States--I don't want anybody coming to the floor and voting against this saying, `I need to fund my disaster because we had flooding,' or, `We had a freeze,' or, `We had milk cows that needed assistance,' or whatever that emergency might be, we put money in for the emergency. We put money in to fund the emergency. 
We are just saying it has to be on budget so next year we will have to plug money in. We can't get away with the $300 million facade we have been doing under the Budget Committee and under the Appropriations Committee and pretending we are funding things. 
All I am saying is go ahead, put the $1.6 billion in to take care of whatever emergency, but take the emergency designation off so Congress will have to live within the caps and hopefully still have a surplus so we can save Social Security.

There would be money in FEMA's account to meet whatever emergencies might arise. It also means that the money that is spent when spent in the year 1999 and the year 2000, which is when the money would actually be spent, would come under the caps. And we have caps, we agreed to caps, we said here is how much money we will spend on discretionary spending accounts. It is $580-some billion. That money would have to go in that amount.

To answer you specifically, if you wanted to stay on your HUD baseline--you have a baseline, all the other subcommittees have a baseline--you would either have to fund it within your baseline, within your group, within your subcommittee, or if that wasn't possible, you would have to borrow from some other subcommittee, but the total would have to stay on the cap amount.

Mr. NICKLES. Madam President, you have to use offsets; $600 million in 1999, we have a total amount of spending on domestic discretionary side. I have the 1997 figure of $288--it is more than that in 1999. 
I might mention, between 1997 and 1998, it went from $274 to $288, an increase of $14 billion that went into domestic discretionary accounts. I don't have the figure in front of me, what it increases in the next year, but there was $14 billion in increases. You only have outlays of about $600 million. Somewhere in that $288 or almost $300 billion we have to find an offset. I think we should do that.

I mention we had a $14 billion growth in domestic discretionary between 1997 and 1998. It could be in the growth funds. We are only talking about maybe $600 million or $500 million per year. It could come out of your subcommittee or out of another subcommittee, but the point is it 
would be accountable. 
We wouldn't have something totally extraneous to whatever budget agreement we come up with.

Mr. NICKLES. Madam President, I appreciate the comments made by my good friends from Missouri and Maryland. I do look forward to working with them. 
We need to reform this program. A lot of evidence is in need 
of reforming this program because, in fact, we do not fund it but then every year we come up and start asking for more money. I want to tell my friend and colleague from Maryland something, because I gave you half an answer. I said that within the caps we would have to offset, although the caps have increased. There is one other option. If we breach the caps, the budget law calls for a sequester to offset. That is how that would happen--one of those two ways. I wanted to make sure of that. That is my purpose. I think we should stay within the caps, so we can keep more money to either pay down the debt, or if there is a surplus, we can save Social Security or give taxpayers relief, not spend more money. 
I hate to work so hard on the budget and come and say we are going to have a great big bill and spend billions of dollars. This started at $2 billion, and now it is going to be over a $5 billion bill. My colleague from Missouri mentioned that I read the committee report. It said that in last year's emergency bill we spent $500 million, I tell my friend from Alaska. We do not know how they spent it. 
I compliment my colleagues that are heading up the HUD subcommittee. They are trying to stay up with the housing people and say, `Where did that money go?' It is not accountable. Then I heard, `Well, we spent $500 million on rebuilding one hospital.' I appreciate the fact when Oklahoma City had the Murrah Building bombing in 1995, which killed 169 people, we put in $39 million. We also paid for it; we had an offset. That was good. I might have supported it without an offset. 
But I think we ought to be within the budget and try to fix this problem. We ought to find out what happened to that $500 million Community Development Block Grant money last year. I do not like that. I would have opposed the amendment. I was going to oppose the $260 million add-on for Community Development Block Grant money. I am bothered that the administration didn't request this money until yesterday, if this was such an urgent need and we had to have this for these emergencies. They came up yesterday. They had plenty of money a week ago. But all of a sudden, now we need the money. I cannot help but get the feeling that they see a gravy train coming along and we are going to call this thing an emergency and say, give us an extra almost $2 billion so we can fund a lot of things that will be off budget, so we don't have to live by the caps.

Mr. NICKLES. Do we have the request in writing? The staff informs me that we do. I have not seen that. I would appreciate a copy of that. It is a heck of a deal. Here we are on Wednesday, and this request came in on Tuesday to give us another $1.8 billion or $1.9 billion, and we are just going to do it. For the life of me, if this is that much of an emergency, you would think James Lee Witt would have been working on every Member of the Congress saying, `We have to have this money.' He has not. 
What I was hearing up until a week or so ago is that they had enough. Now, all of a sudden, they need $1.6 billion or $260 million on Community Development Block Grant money, and we do not even know how they spent $500 million last year. They cannot even account for that $500 million of the emergency money last year. Yet, we are getting ready to give another $260 million plus $1.6 billion for FEMA. I think that is a mistake. I am told that there are no community block development requests from the administration--none. There may be a verbal request, but no written request. I am assuming that is what my staff is telling me. They did not make the request, but we gave them the money anyway. I know some of my colleagues would like to have that money.

Mr. NICKLES. I am getting too many fights going at the same time. I have a nice engagement with Senator Kennedy on a HCFA add-on that was put into the budget, which we will be voting on later. And $1.6 billion is on the floor now. That is enough. I am not trying to anger Members; I am trying to have a little bit of fiscal responsibility. 
Again, since FEMA did not make this request until yesterday, I cannot believe it is that urgent. But I remind my colleagues, my amendment does not strike the $1.6 billion; it just says that the emergency classification will not be in there. So for next year's budget it will have to live within the caps, and for the following year it will have to live within the caps. That is the essence of my amendment, so we can help protect the surplus and maybe give taxpayers some relief. 
So that is my hope, and that is my desire. If there is going to be a motion to table my amendment, I urge colleagues to vote no on tabling the amendment.

Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, this resolution is a bipartisan resolution which several of us have worked on for the last few days. I thank my friends and colleagues, particularly Senator Lieberman, who worked on this, Senator Levin, Senator Biden, and other colleagues, Senator Lott and his staff. We wanted to speak out strongly and condemn the atrocities that have happened recently in Kosovo, not condemning the Serbian people but, frankly, condemning the Serbian leadership and primarily that of Mr. Milosevic. The killings that have happened recently, which culminated in the loss of life of at least 60 people including women and children who were slaughtered by their special police forces, are an atrocity. It needs to be condemned, and we need united action. 
This resolution condemns the slaughter, it condemns the atrocities that have happened recently, and it also calls upon the United States and the world community to act together to take action to see that it does not happen again. 
The administration was in the process of actually reducing sanctions to the Serbian Government, to Mr. Milosevic. They have now postponed lifting those sanctions. 
We also in this legislation say that the United States should freeze funds of the Governments of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and Serbia if the Government of Serbia fails to comply by March 25, 1998, with the terms set forth by the contact group. I think that will have some impact. I think that will get his attention. 
He has been a very difficult person to deal with. Some of us have met with Mr. Milosevic. I met with him in 1990, along with Senator Dole, Senator Mack, and others. And I will not forget this individual. We wanted to visit Kosovo. We did visit Kosovo. But I remember Mr. Milosevic didn't want us to visit Kosovo, and he went to great lengths to see that we wouldn't go, but we did go. We were greeted by thousands of individuals, mostly Albanians, who wanted to see us and also express to us their desire to have some degree of autonomy, their desire to have some degree of freedom, which was being denied to them at that time by the Serbian leadership, denied in many, many forms--denied in the press, denied in employment; they were persecuted; they were prosecuted; they were harassed. And we have known ever since then that this area had the potential to explode and to cause significant pain and carnage for a lot of innocent people. 
So, Mr. President, this resolution which has overwhelming bipartisan support I hope will extend a good, strong signal to the Milosevic government that they need to join the community of nations, they need to stop ethnic cleansing now. 
They need to stop ethnic cleansing now. I think there is strong support, not only for this statement, not only for the sanctions that are called for in this legislation, but I hope across the international community there will be an outrage expressed if there is not a change in behavior by the Milosevic government. 
I thank my colleagues for their support for this resolution. I understand--I believe, just for the information of our colleagues, that we expect to vote on this resolution at 6 o'clock, and I hope we will have a unanimous vote as well. 
Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, for the information of all Senators, I said just a few minutes ago I thought there would be a vote at 6 o'clock. In just a moment I will be yielding back the time and we will have the rollcall vote immediately. Staffs might indicate that to their Senators. We will have the vote in just a couple of minutes. 
I thank and compliment Senator Dodd of Connecticut because he likewise was working on a resolution. This resolution was an effort by several of us who felt we needed to express condemnation towards the outrageous behavior of Mr. Milosevic. Senator Dodd had a resolution, I had a resolution, others were working on them, so we had a good bipartisan effort so the Senate would speak in an united fashion condemning these recent actions. I thank him for his support.

Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I wish to compliment my colleagues, Senator Moynihan and Senator Breaux and Senator Kerrey, for the introduction of this legislation. I am not joining as a cosponsor now, but I certainly want to sponsor and echo the comments that they made that we need to reform Social Security and we need to move Social Security away from a pay-go system into a funded system, a capitalized system, a system that has an investment behind it, one that people get to own and control and can invest in. 
They have taken a small step in that direction. As I understand it, the proposal would allow 2 percent of the 12.4 percent to go in that direction, either to be returned in the form of a tax cut or to be put into a personalized savings Social Security account. 
I echo very strongly that right now we should depart from an unfunded system, a pay-go system, a system that is destined for bankruptcy unless we change it, unless we save it--and a lot of us are very committed to saving Social Security. We think the real way to save Social Security is to move it into a funded system. Private plans have been doing that all across the country. They are allowing individuals, participants in their plans, to reap the benefits and rewards of good investments. 
I heard my colleague--I think Senator Breaux mentioned that if a Federal employee had invested 100 percent in the stock option plan last year, the rate of return was 40 percent.

Mr. NICKLES. I was. I put 100 percent of my thrift plan in, and it made a 40 percent return. For the S&P index for those months, which included September 30, it was a 34 percent rate of return, a phenomenal rate of return. It was a lot less for Government bonds. There are three different options for Federal employees. They all made significant returns far greater than the 1 or 2 percent that a person can make in Social Security today. 
So we can allow those accounts to accumulate and grow and allow people to become entrepreneurs and to achieve some real savings and also lessen their dependence on Social Security at the same time. 
Senator Moynihan also had the nerve to say--I think he said, that we should have, an accurate CPI. Again, a lot of people do not want to touch that. But we should have an accurate CPI. If we have a balanced budget or if we have a surplus or a deficit, we should have an accurate CPI. And, yes, there are significant savings in that proposal as well. 
He talked about some other things, talking about increasing the retirement dates. That is not real popular maybe with a lot of people, but, frankly, you have to look at the actuarial analysis of Social Security. Social Security has big, big problems. Although i have some reservations, I think my colleague from New York has taken some giant steps in the right direction. 
I understand there is a little tax increase on the personal income tax side. I would like to see if we can do it without that. Transitionally we may have some challenges. I would very much like to get the percentage up from 2 percent. Actually, right now an individual pays 12.4 percent of their payroll for Social Security up to $68,000, $68,400, I believe. I would like to be able to get half of that into an individual's personal savings account where they can really see some rewards. That is over $9,000 that an individual, if they make $68,000, is paying in Social Security today. It would be nice if they could put half or at least a significant portion of that into their own retirement account where they can watch it grow, where they can invest it. They could be very cautious in their investments and invest it in T bills if they so desired or invest it in stocks or they can invest it in bonds. They would have those options. 
I would like to give them the maximum amount of options that we give people for 401(k)s, that we give people for IRAs, that we give Senate employees through thrift plans and so on. I would like to give all American taxpayers that option so we can have a lot of millionaires, a lot of people driving a truck in Nebraska or Oklahoma becoming millionaires by the time they retire so they will not become dependent, frankly, on an unfunded pay-go system like we have right now into which their children will be paying enormous sums in the future. 
I think you hear a lot of people trying to sell programs by using kids. I think we need to be very, very concerned about future liabilities in Social Security for our kids. How in the world will they be able to make those payments if we do not reform the system? Senator Moynihan had a chart out there that said the payroll tax would have to go up astronomically. I do not think that is fair for our kids. 
Maybe we can alleviate that pressure if we allow individuals now, before they hit their retirement age, to be able to set up these personal savings accounts and be able to reap decent rates of return and become less dependent on their children and grandchildren for their future retirement benefits. 
Conceptually, I commend my colleagues on their work, and I think you will find strong bipartisanship support for working together to see if we cannot make this concept of making funded capitalized personal savings accounts a part of every individual's Social Security for the future. We will work to try to make that a reality in America. 
Thank you, Mr. President.

Mr. NICKLES. Madam President, I also compliment my colleague, Senator Warner from Virginia, for his leadership on this. Senator Baucus, Senator Graham, Senator Byrd, Senator Chafee--a lot of people--worked a long time on this bill. I hope we can finish this bill today. If not today, certainly this week. This is an important piece of legislation. 
The reason why I cosponsored the amendment of my colleague from Florida, Senator Mack, is because I happen to think he is right. I know a lot of work has been going into allocations. The Senators managing this bill have been bending over backwards to be fair to every Senator. I think they have been doing the best job they can and I compliment them on their work. But I happen to think Senator Mack is right. Should the gasoline tax be a prerogative of the State or the Federal Government? Should we all as colleagues have to bend and beg and plead? I do not really like doing that. I don't like asking for money in appropriations. I have done it on occasion. Senator Byrd has accommodated me on occasion when he was chairman of the Appropriations Committee. Sometimes Senator Stevens has. I appreciate that. But I really do not enjoy that nor do I enjoy, when we have a highway bill, saying, `Oh, please, we need more money. We are not doing very well in this bill. We are not doing as well as I hoped.' 
We happen to be a donor State. I know Virginia has been. I know Florida has. I know a lot of States have. We don't like it. We don't like sending a dollar to Washington, DC, and getting 80 cents back in return. Unfortunately, that has happened year after year after year. We are talking about a lot more money. 
I heard on the floor discussions: Senator Warner is going to get 50 percent more, 52 percent. So is Oklahoma. It's a lot more money compared to the last 6 years, a lot more money to our States. 
Every one of our contractors is going to be delighted with this bill. They have been knocking on my door: Please pass this bill. They maybe don't get involved in should we be donors or should we not. My thought, though, is this tax really should belong to the States. I do read the Constitution. The Constitution and the 10 amendments say all the rights and powers are reserved to the States and to the people. Shouldn't we allow the States to have the prerogative to have a gasoline tax and spend it the way they want? Then we don't have to fight and beg and plead and say, `Hey, wait, I want 90 cents of my dollar back.' If I do really good, I will get 90 cents on the dollar back. You lose 10 percent off the top. Not all States lose 10 percent; some States do better than other States. I guess that is the way it is always going to be when you have a national program. 
Our State does not qualify as a dense State. That applies to some big States. There is a dense State formula in here that helps some States. Our State doesn't qualify for the Appalachian Regional Commission. I know some States do. There is a bonus provision. Maybe we do--no, we didn't qualify for that. We get a little something. 
My point being you have to beg, cajole, and plead. Maybe you come up with 90 cents, but that is 90 cents on 90 cents. My math is not always accurate, but sometimes it's fast, and 90 percent of 90 percent is about 81 cents. I have seen one chart that says we will come out with about 82 cents, maybe 83 cents. The point being, you send $1 to Washington, DC, and in return you lose maybe 17, 18 percent before it gets back to the State. 
Then, as Senator Mack mentioned, when it comes back, there are a lot of strings. It's not quite as simple as, `Here, States, you get your money back. You can have the 82 cents or 90 cents or whatever and you can spend it as you wish.' That is not the case. There are lots of strings. You have little requirements like you have to meet Davis-Bacon. You have to meet a lot of other requirements, Federal highway standards and so on. Guess what. A lot of these roads are not Federal highway roads or they are not part of the interstate system. The interstate system is, by and large, complete. It needs a lot of maintenance, I guess, but certainly that could be maintained without this 4.3 cents per gallon. 
In my State of Oklahoma, the legislature has already passed legislation, already the law of the land. If the Federal Government does not extend the 4.3 cents, or if we repeal it, that tax increase goes on automatically for our State. So there will not be any loss of income. The State is going to pick it up. Our State is going to be a lot better off. 
Every once in a while you do vote your State interest around here, and my State interest is, let's repeal that 4.3 cents and we are going to get 100 percent of the money, not 90 cents, not 82 cents, we are going to get 100 percent of the money. And we don't get the Federal strings, and the Governor and the legislature can decide how they want to spend it. They don't have to spend it on this type of road--primary road, secondary road. They have all the flexibility they want because it's theirs. They have all the authority. They don't have to worry about the differences. Hey, wait a minute, budget authority/budget outlays, this is not easy. And we are going to allocate 100 percent of this money for contract authority, but the outlays won't hit for a number of years. We don't have to worry about that. If we repeal this, the States are going to have 100 percent of the money and they can let the contracts and they can make the decisions and, frankly, I think some of us should have some more confidence in our States. So I rise in support of this amendment. 
I opposed the 1993 tax increase that was passed by President Clinton at that time. It didn't have a Republican vote, as I recall. I thought that was a mistake. That was a 4.3-cent-per-gallon gasoline tax increase that went into the general revenue. It did not go to highways. A lot of us said we thought that was a mistake. At least in this bill, and I compliment the sponsors, at least we are going to rectify that. Under this bill, assuming the amendment of Senator Mack and myself does not pass, this money at least will be spent for highways. I think that is a giant step in the right direction. I compliment the sponsors, and particularly Senator Graham and Senator Byrd, who were very persistent--I started to say stubborn in their efforts. Because that helped make that happen. That doesn't mean our budget problems are over. We are going to have some challenging times to stay within the caps on the budget, but we will wrestle with that. Hopefully, we will stay on the caps in the budget and will still be able to put 100 percent of the moneys coming in into the highway program and the gasoline tax will stay in the highway program. 
I think the better fix would be the fix that Senator Mack is proposing, and that is, let's allow the States to have this tax and let's give the States the option. 
My guess is a strong majority of the States would continue the tax, because all States have very significant needs and demands on their highways for safety, for maintenance, for upgrades. Certainly my State does, and I know that is the action our State would take. 
So I believe the best solution would be the solution proposed by my colleagues from Florida, and that would be to give the States the option. Let's repeal the 4.3-cent tax. I think it was a mistake in 1993; I still think it is a mistake in 1998. Let's allow that money to go back to the States, and if the States want to enact it, they can, or if they want to return it to the taxpayers, they will have that option to do so as well. 
With that, I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of the Mack amendment. I yield the floor.

Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I rise, one, to compliment my colleague, Senator Murkowski from Alaska, for his speech in talking about the United Nations and their increase of the flow of oil. I want to make a couple comments about the administration's handling of the latest crisis with Iraq and express my very strong displeasure with the administration, because I do not think they were very open with Congress. 
I met with Secretary of State Albright, Secretary of Defense Cohen, National Security Adviser Sandy Berger, and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Shelton on numerous occasions when we were debating what our reaction should be to Iraq's noncompliance with the U.N. resolutions allowing arms control inspectors to investigate whether or not they were building up munitions of mass destruction. I know the Senator from Arizona sat in on several of these meetings. 
As you know, we were in the process of building up armed forces. We were very close to having a military strike. Some people were suggesting different alternatives. The Senator from Alaska said, `Well, maybe we should curtail the flow of oil. We 
have a program that is called oil for food that has been going on for years now. Maybe if we tighten that up, it would put an economic squeeze on the Iraqis and maybe they would change their behavior and maybe we wouldn't need to drop bombs to have Saddam Hussein realize the errors of his way and that he needs to comply with the U.N. resolutions.' 
I told the Secretary of State that I was upset about the fact that our international coalition has dissipated, if not disappeared. The only real strong supporter we had in this entire venture was Great Britain. We did not have strong, at least visible support, or audible support from the Saudis or from Turkey. We did not have access to the bases in those countries for bombing purposes if there was an airstrike. That bothered me a lot. 
But what bothers me as much now, when we were discussing different options in lieu of a military strike, and one of the options was curtailing the flow of oil that was discussed in this Capitol with leaders of our Government, our leaders did not tell Congress that they had already agreed in the Security Council, or they were working on an agreement in the Security Council, on February 20, to more than double the amount of oil that would be used in this oil-for-food program--more than doubled. 
Actually, they go from $2 billion every 6 months to $5.2 billion. They did not tell us that. Most people were not aware of the fact that before the Secretary General flew to Baghdad for his effort to avert or stop the airstrikes and achieve compliance, 2 days before, the U.N. Security Council had raised the amount of the oil-for-food program and more than doubled it. We had those sanctions on since 1991. We restricted the flow of oil to that specific amount of $2 billion for every 6 months, and then all of a sudden, just when we are getting ready to maybe have airstrikes and the U.N. Secretary General was going to go to Baghdad to negotiate a deal--he did not use it for leverage, we basically gave them the carrot--we gave him that incentive before he went to negotiate. 
It just happens to be a coincidence? I do not think so. And why wasn't the administration forthcoming to Members of Congress and say, `Well, we've already done this,' or `We are now negotiating the U.N. Security Council to do this.' They did not do that. They did not tell this Senator, they did not tell other Senators that they were in the process of doing it, and that bothers me. It bothers me a lot. 
I for one had serious misgivings, as I know other Members of this body did, on how far we should go in response and how much of a blank check this Congress should give this administration in dealing with Saddam Hussein, but for them to not tell the Congress or the American people, and the fact that the increase in this oil-for-food program was going forward at this very critical time--just a coincidence, I guess--is more than an oversight. It is a very serious mistake. A very serious mistake in dealing with Congress and a very serious mistake in our foreign policy as well. 
So I compliment my colleague from Alaska for bringing this to our attention. And I wish to bring it to the administration's attention that some of us might have been willing to say, hey, let us use the oil-for-food program as an incentive to get him to comply. I do not think we would have said, let us give it to him, and then hope that maybe he would agree with the Secretary General. Maybe the deal was already cut before the Secretary General left. We have not heard that, but maybe that was the case. But in any case, I think the administration was not very forthcoming with Congress. And that is not a very positive sign. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I want to speak today on the Women's Health Research and Prevention Amendments of 1998 introduced by my colleagues Senator Frist and Majority Leader Lott. This bill would amend the Public Health Service Act to revise and extend certain programs with respect to women's health research and prevention activities at the National Institutes of Health and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 
Education and Research are the key to providing the best health care for women and for that matter, all Americans. The Women's Health Research and Prevention Amendments promote precisely that. Just two examples are the extension of NIH research programs for basic and clinical research and education efforts with respect to cancer, breast cancer, and ovarian and related cancer; and the extension of the CDC National Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection Program. These are the kinds of programs that will improve women's health. 
I am pleased to be a cosponsor of the Women's Health bill because I believe that research is the best way for Congress to respond to the concern over women's health issues and health issues generally. I make this point, Mr. President, because I have been disappointed that Congress has recently put on lab coats and begun practicing medicine. We have gotten into the dangerous habit of legislating clinical procedures which are not based in science or research but rather driven by social opinion and special interests. 
You only have to look back to the end of the 104th Congress to illustrate my point. A majority of Congress supported an effort last year to mandate that all insurance plans cover 48-hour maternity stays in hospitals. However, serval months following the passage of that legislation an article appeared in the Journal of the American Medical Association stating that the `content does not solve the most important problems regarding the need for early postpartum/postnatal services. The legislation may give the public a false sense of security. It may call into question the reasonableness of relying on legislative mechanisms to micro manage clinical practice.' 
In other words, Congress made a nice, laudable attempt. We said we are going to mandate 48 hours, but it has had no appreciable improvement on the quality of health care. It appears that our so-called victory in passing 48 hours may have in fact done more harm than good in helping women and newborns. This experience, and others like it, should have taught us what not to do. 
It should have taught us that before we endeavor to decide what is the best therapy, procedure, or treatment for any one disease, let us look for a minute at what we are doing. What are the unintended consequences of federal mandates on health insurance companies regarding treatments and coverage of services? 
Let's take breast cancer as another example. Various bills have been introduced in the last few months that mandate a length of stay for mastectomies or require coverage of an inpatient stay for women undergoing breast cancer surgery for an unspecified length of time, to be determined by the physician. 
Were Congress to legislate in favor of one form of treatment over another, we are sending the message that one treatment is preferable to the other. Treatments are constantly changing. Health care needs to be flexible and should not lock doctors in to a specific approach. Shouldn't we allow medical research to decide the best course of action? If the federal government mandates a specific treatment, length of stay or procedure, that then becomes the standard. 
In addition, employing mandates in the place of valid research runs the risk of discouraging innovative treatments. For example, recent improvements in anesthesiology are a result of patient appeals to cut down on nausea and vomiting after breast surgery as well as a desire to recover at home. 
Longer mandated stays could discourage doctors and patients from developing the best possible plan for recovery. Patients may choose to stay in the hospital for an extended period of time out of fear or lack of knowledge and risk infection. Patients may have the false idea that longer hospital stays equal the best possible treatment when, in fact, recent research indicates that is not necessarily the case. 
According to a November 6, 1996, article in The Wall Street Journal, The Johns Hopkins Breast Center in Baltimore, which has gradually eliminated inpatient stays for some women undergoing certain types of mastectomies, has found that outpatient mastectomies are associated with lower infection rates and high levels of satisfaction among women. We have the responsibility to arm patients with the kind of sound research and education this legislation provides, not prescriptive mandates from Dr. Congress. 
Lillie Shockeney, R.N. the Education and Outreach Director at the Johns Hopkins Hospital Breast Center and a breast cancer survivor, summed up best in a Finance Committee hearing on November 5, 1997. `. . . I am concerned that it [S. 249, The Women's Health and Cancer Rights Act of 1997] doesn't solve the real medical dilemma that women battling breast cancer are faced with today. We need to be striving to improve patient care for patients undergoing breast cancer surgery rather than unknowingly promote keeping it at status quo. We need to be promoting the development of a comprehensive patient education program and have teams of health care professionals dedicated to striving to improve the care and treatment provided to women with breast cancer.' 
Mr. President, I want to congratulate Senator Frist and Senator Lott for bringing this issue before us in such a responsible and proactive bill. These programs go a long way to serve women. I thank the chair and encourage my colleagues to support this common sense legislation.

Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, regretfully I rise in opposition to this amendment. I say regretfully because if I were in the State Senate of Oklahoma, I would vote in favor of this amendment. Presently, there is no Federal standard or Federal law for blood alcohol level--none. So we have an effort now to federalize a national problem. I don't think we should do that. 
I led the effort years ago that would allow the States to set speed limits. I thought the States should set the speed limits, 
not the Federal Government. I didn't say that I thought every State should increase their speed limits. I thought States should set the speed limit. 
What about the alcohol level? Again, if I were a State legislator, I would support the lower level. Fifteen States have this level--.08. Maybe it should be lower. Let the States make that decision. I hate to federalize problems, and I hate to tell the States that if they don't do such and such we are going to withhold 10 percent of their money, or 5 percent of their money the first few years and 10 percent thereafter. 
Whose money is it? Is that Federal money? No. That money is paid for by our constituents, by our consumers, and by our people who are on the road. They pay that money. It comes to Washington, DC, and now we start putting strings on it. We basically tell the States if you do not pass a law that we have determined is best--and I don't know anything about blood alcohol limits. I have heard three beers, I have heard four beers. I don't know. I have not done the homework. I will take their word for it. But really, should we be dictating or mandating that on the States? I don't think so. And tell the States if they don't pass such and such, we are going to withhold 5 percent of their funds. 
We are talking about millions and millions--hundreds of millions--of dollars. In a few years, it will be 10 percent. So it is a real heavy penalty if they don't subscribe to our Federal dictate. I just disagree with that. That money came from the States. It came from individuals. This is not Federal money. For us to put on these strings, I think is a mistake. 
I am very sympathetic to the goal of the authors of the amendment, and I compliment them for trying to say we want to reduce drunken drivers on the streets. I want to do the same thing. I just do not agree with their tactics. 
The Commerce Committee amendment has some incentives to encourage States to lower levels, and if the States lower those levels, they can get more money. In other words, a little bit of a carrot. This is a heavy stick. As a matter of fact, this is more than a heavy stick. This is a dagger. This says you have to do it. I think we should encourage it. 
Again, I go back to the Constitution. Sometimes we ignore the Constitution. But the 10th amendment to the Constitution says:  
The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people. 
Time and time again we come to this body and we find a problem. And drunk driving is a real serious problem. But we want to have a Federal solution: The Federal Government knows best. I think the framers of the Constitution were right when they said we should reserve those powers to the States and to the people, and encourage the States--maybe even give them a little bonus--if they make some moves that we think would be positive. But to federalize it and now, for the first time in history, have a blood alcohol content which has always been the prerogative of the States, in my opinion, is wrong. 
I can count the votes. My guess is that the proponents probably have the votes. 
But I think, again, we are trampling on States' rights. We are also trampling on this idea or encouraging this idea that if there is a problem, we need a Federal solution, and we will not give back your money. I resented that when I was a State legislator. I resented the fact that when we sent our highway moneys to Washington, DC, from our State, we only got about 80 cents back. That bothered me. We would only get about 80 cents on the dollar back. Then, not only that, when we got the 80 cents back, we got all the strings attached: You have to have the Federal highway speed limit; you have to have all of these other Federal requirements; you have to have the Davis-Bacon standard. You have to pass all of these rules. By the time we complied with those rules, that dollar would only buy about 60 some cents' worth of road. It wasn't a very good deal for our State. 
So I would like to not put more punitive actions on the States if they don't comply with what we think--Government knows best. 
Again, I want to compliment the authors. But I think this is an intrusion into States and I urge my colleagues to vote no on the amendment.

<TEXT>
Mr. NICKLES. I understand. 
Mr. President, one of the reasons why I rise in opposition to the amendment is, the penalty is too hard. I care just as much about the child that Senator Lautenberg alluded to as anybody else. I care just as much about wanting to eliminate drunk driving as anybody in this Chamber. 
The penalty under this bill is too harsh. And 10 percent of the highway funds is--looking at any State--the State of Texas is $1 billion over 6 years. That is a pretty big penalty. The penalty in my State of Oklahoma is $200 million. That is a pretty big penalty. 
The reason why I was asking or inquiring about is it amendable is that maybe we should change the penalty from 5 percent and 10 percent to half a percent and 1 percent. You are still talking about real money that would be a real incentive, but 10 percent is too high. In other words, we want to encourage States. 
I mention the Commerce Committee amendment has an incentive program. It is not a lot. I think we found out from staff--I did not know when I made my earlier comments--$25 million, not much of a carrot, a little bit of a carrot. So we encourage States to do it. Maybe that should be enhanced a little bit. 
But I look at the draconian penalties in this thing. This thing is really a dagger at the highway program to take 10 percent of the funds. In the State of Michigan you are talking about $477 million. That is a lot of money. I mean, so the penalties, in my opinion, are too high. 
The reason why I was inquiring about a second-degree amendment is maybe we should change the penalty and make it 1 percent or 2 percent instead of 10 percent. I think it is too much of a gun at the head of the States and saying, `You have to do this or you're going to lose hundreds of millions of dollars.' 
The State of Texas would lose $1 billion over 6 years. The State of California over $1 billion. For the State of California it would be $1.3 billion over a 6-year period of time. That is a lot of money. 
So I understand the desire that some people want to Federalize alcohol-content crimes. That, I believe, should be left in the State's jurisdiction. I kind of wonder, if you have States that are not complying--maybe the States are going to change their law but do not really enforce it. Are we going to have the Federal Government come in and say, `Wait a minute. Now you're going to have to monitor the amount of enforcement'? 
We cannot have the State of Rhode Island say, well, they are going to change the law but not really enforce it until you get over the .1. I do not know that that would happen, but I question the wisdom of Federalizing blood alcohol content. 
It has not been a Federal crime. It has not been a Federal incidence. Now we are saying the Federal Government is telling the 
States, you have to do this or you will lose hundreds of millions of dollars--in some States billions of dollars. I think it is overkill. I think it is too punitive. I think we should consider--and maybe we will not do it now; I know the bill has a little ways to go; it still has the conference--but if this provision is going to be in, I think we should reduce the penalties. 
I think it is far too harsh. It is too much of a dictate, too much of a mandate, too much trampling on, I believe, of the Federal Government saying, `Before you get your money back, you must do the following: Before you get your highway money back, we're going to put an additional string on it, an additional penalty, up to 10 percent, which is hundreds of millions of dollars.' I think it goes too far. 
So, Mr. President, one other comment. My colleagues alluded to the fact that in 1984 we did something comparable, and we had a national drinking age of 21. Now, it might surprise some of my colleagues on the other side. I supported that. And the reason is, I live very close to the border in Oklahoma. And Oklahoma had a 21; Kansas had an 18. And we had people running back and forth across the State line to take advantage of that situation. Not a very safe situation. So I supported it. 
I saw some differences in that provision, although the penalty was still very high. It was too high then, in my opinion. This, I think, is a little bit different. Now we are Federalizing blood alcohol content, and I seriously doubt the wisdom of doing that. And we are putting far too heavy of a burden on the States for noncompliance. 
Again, for those of us that read the Constitution and say all of the rights and powers are reserved to States and the people, I think some of our colleagues and proponents, who have very good intentions, in the bill are saying, there is a problem and, therefore, we have to have a Federal solution. We are going to use the heavy hand of the Federal Government and withhold funds that come from the States, come from the people, and say, you cannot have that money back unless you do as we determine what is proper. I think that is a mistake. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, recent Congressional oversight of the Internal Revenue Service has revealed an agency which has virtually limitless power to enforce the tax code. One aspect of this power is the ability of the IRS to use its summons authority to force taxpayers to turn over books, papers, records, or other data in the course of an audit. 
Recently, the IRS has started to use its administrative summons power to gain access to the source code for computer software products. Source code for software is a human-readable form of computer language written by software programmers, and it contains all the `tricks of the trade' which a programmer uses to ultimately make the software product do its job. After a programmer writes the source code, it is `compiled' into machine-readable form called executable code or object code. If the software is being sold or otherwise distributed to customers, the executable code is copied onto diskettes or CD-ROM's for the customers' use. 
The IRS has used its summons power to obtain computer software source code in several different audit situations. The IRS has sought the source code for the software used to produce the tax return from the vendor of the software. 
The IRS has sought the source code for a software product in connection with a Section 482 transfer pricing audit with respect to a license for the software product to a foreign subsidiary, and the IRS has summoned the source code for software developed by a computer service company in the course of an audit of the firm's research and experimentation credit. The IRS has summoned the executable code of taxpayer's tax preparation software in order to run `what-if' scenarios based on the taxpayer's records during an audit. 
The primary problem with complying with these summons is that, in each instance the IRS would need to hire an outside consultant in order to make any meaningful use of the source code. Such outside consultants likely would be competitors or potential competitors of the software company. A skilled computer programmer can discern the software company's trade secrets from an examination of the source code, whereas trade secrets cannot readily be discerned from an examination of the executable code. 
Further, problems can also arise when the IRS issues a summons to a computer software company in connection with an audit of one of their customers. This requires the software publisher to look through its own, not the taxpayer's, voluminous records for the relevant versions of the programs in question. This can place an undue burden on the software publisher by requiring their key technical personnel to be diverted from their regular work to help with the tax audit of a customer. 
Finally, if the IRS is allowed to use a taxpayer's tax preparation software and records to run `what-if' scenarios during an audit, the taxpayer will be forced to justify a tax return they did not file. 
In several of these situations, Mr. President, the owner of the computer software source code has objected to the summons in order to protect their trade secrets. Unfortunately, because the IRS summons authority is so broad, the courts have been constrained to side with the IRS in most cases, leaving computer software companies with inadequate protection for their trade secrets. 
Perhaps a better way to explain the issue, Mr. President, is with the following analogy. Imagine that during an audit of the Coca-Cola Company, the IRS issues a summons for the secret recipe for Coke. Even though the IRS can see the Coke, taste it, and read the ingredients on the side of the can, they still insist on examining the secret recipe. Now, imagine further than the IRS admits that since they employ no one with 
expertise in this area, they will have to contract with experts from Pepsi to examine Coke's secret recipe. This is the dilemma facing the computer software industry. 
For these reasons, Mr. President, I am introducing the Software Trade Secrets Protection Act. This legislation is similar to a bill introduced in the House of Representatives by Congressman Sam Johnson, and the section 344 of H.R. 2676, the House-passed IRS reform bill. 
The Software Trade Secrets Protection Act provides a general prohibition on the IRS using summons authority to obtain computer software source code. The bill then sets out three exceptions to the general prohibition: (1) cases where the Secretary can demonstrate need, (2) criminal investigations, and (3) internally developed software where competitive issues are not implicated. 
In the first exception, the Secretary has the burden of showing that the need for the source code outweighs the burdens placed on the summoned person and the danger that its trade secrets might be exposed. The bill further provides a series of protections for both source code and executable code if it is eventually examined by the IRS, including provisions intended to prevent the IRS from using a taxpayer's software and data to run `what-if' scenarios during an audit. 
Mr. President, the U.S. software industry leads the world in the development of innovative products and cutting-edge technology. They are one of the fastest growing and most competitive industries in the nation, and their products are unique and ofttimes require special consideration. I believe Congressional hearings have shown what the IRS can and will do if its power is unrestrained. The Software Trade Secrets Protection Act creates good, common-sense restrictions on that power. 
I look forward to working with my colleagues on the Senate Finance Committee to include this legislation in IRS reform legislation this year.

Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, as I mentioned earlier, we are going to have two votes at 11 o'clock on campaign finance. One will be on the so-called McCain-Feingold amendment, as amended by the Snowe amendment yesterday, and the other one will be on the underlying bill that is called the Paycheck Protection Act. That is my bill. Maybe I misnamed the bill. Maybe I should have called it voluntary campaign contributions. I am going to speak on that just for a moment. 
Mr. President, we are talking about campaign reform. I see there are charts on the floor--money is exploding, we need to ban soft money, we need to have more regulations of campaigns. I will tell my colleagues, I am willing to support campaign reforms, and maybe we can come up with different things we might be able to agree on, but I think a fundamental principle should be agreed upon at the outset, and that principle is this: No American should be compelled to contribute to a campaign against their will. No American. It is a fundamental principle. 
We want to encourage people to contribute to campaigns, we want to encourage people to participate in the election process, but no one should be compelled to give. No one should have money taken out of their paycheck every month--against their will--to fund candidates who they don't agree with or to fund a philosophy that they are opposed to. Unfortunately, that happens today, and it happens today to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars. 
Some of my colleagues have irritated me and almost impugned the integrity of Senators--in violation of the rules of the Senate that, incidentally, go all the way back to Thomas Jefferson. They said the purpose of this bill is a killer bill because anybody who supports that bill wants to kill campaign reform. 
I am the author of that bill, and I take very strong exception to that statement. Granted, the New York Times said it, but the New York Times doesn't know this Senator. I am the author of that bill, and I sponsored this bill because a union member came to a town meeting in Owasso, OK, raised his hand and said, `I don't like my money being taken from me every month and being used for political purposes of which I totally disagree. I want to have a voice, I want to have a vote, and if they ask me, I would say no.' 
I told that person at that town meeting that I was going to work to make sure that his campaign contributions would be voluntary, and that is the purpose of this bill. It was not designed to kill McCain-Feingold. It was not designed to kill campaign reform. 
I have stated time and time again, I am willing to try and work out a decent campaign reform bill, but it must be premised on voluntary contributions. That is fundamental. It is a basic American freedom, no one should be compelled or coerced to 
contribute to a campaign against their will. No one. 
No one should be compelled to contribute to a campaign, period. It should be against the law. All we say in our bill is that all campaign contributions must be voluntary. Before money is taken out of a person's paycheck, he or she has to say yes. If they say no, it means no. After all, it is their money. It is not the union's money or somebody else's money; it is the individual's money. 
Unfortunately, that is the situation today for millions of Americans. We are talking about hundreds of millions of dollars. There is a movement growing out in the States, and there is going to be a vote on an initiative in California to protect workers paychecks and ensure all contributions are voluntary. It is also happening in many other States. It should happen all across the country. Frankly, we should do it on the Federal level, because we regulate Federal elections; we protect the freedoms of all Americans. This is supposed to be the body that protects the United States Constitution. 
How in the world did we even allow a system to start where someone can be compelled to contribute to a political campaign or cause against their will? That is wrong, we ought to fix it, and the way to fix it is to support the underlying bill. 
I say vote against the McCain-Feingold amendment. Why? Because McCain-Feingold did not say in addition to the underlying bill they want to add the following. It said strike the voluntary contribution language, strike that language, and replace it with McCain-Feingold. McCain-Feingold eliminates soft money. Soft money is at least done voluntarily. They want to end soft money contributions but they want to continue to have forced campaign contributions from union members. 
The language we drafted in this bill said it would be voluntary for employees of banks, it would be voluntary for employees of corporations, it would be voluntary for all employees--all employees. McCain-Feingold doesn't say, `Well, we'll take that language and we'll add to it.' No, it says strike that language. McCain-Feingold is the killer. It says, `We don't want voluntary contributions but we will try and micromanage campaigns and what people can say in elections.' 
Some of those things in McCain-Feingold are pretty debatable on constitutional grounds. The Senator from Kentucky has done a good job in handling that debate. I want to say that all campaign contributions should be voluntary. 
This is not an anti-union member provision. There is nothing further from the truth. This is a proworker bill. This allows every single member of a union to say yes or no to campaign contributions. It gives them a voice. There are millions of union members who get up every day and work hard, pay their taxes and union dues, and are rewarded with a gag order over how those dues--their wages--are spent on politics. That is not right. 
If you go to a union hall and ask a bunch of union members, `Hey, do you think you should have the choice to be able to say whether or not your money goes for campaign contributions or not?' they will say, `Yes, I want that right.' 
Let's give them that right. That is not anti-union, it is prounion worker. 
Unfortunately, some people say, `Oh, no, that's wrong; that's a killer bill; that is going to stop campaign reform.' Why? Why is that a killer bill? Because organized labor bosses don't like it? Since when do they have a veto over this body? Since when do organized labor bosses say, `Wait a minute, we don't think campaign contributions should be voluntary. So if you adopt the Nickles-Lott bill for paycheck protection--voluntary campaign contributions--we don't have a bill.' Why? Because President Clinton says he will veto it? Why? Because a few leaders in organized labor don't like it? 
Why? Because organized labor bosses put in hundreds of millions of dollars in campaigns for the Democratic Party? Do they have a blank check veto over this body, over this Congress? Why, I should hope not. I would hope that one group cannot just say, `Well, we don't like that bill. Therefore, if you add to that bill, no deal.' And that is basically what is happening. 
I strongly disagree with that position. I strongly believe that all Americans should have the right to contribute to campaigns; no one should be compelled against their will to contribute to political causes and campaigns. 
So, Mr. President, at 11 o'clock, we are going to vote on McCain-Feingold, which is a substitute amendment, which strikes the underlying voluntary campaign contribution language. I hope that we will defeat McCain-Feingold. Then I hope that we will pass--regardless of what happens to McCain-Feingold, the underlying bill, the Paycheck Protection Act, the voluntary contributions act. 
I hope that my colleagues, regardless of what happens on McCain-Feingold, will vote for voluntary campaign contributions for all Americans. That is what the second vote is about. I hope that we will vote for it and we can get cloture. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I want to make some statements dealing with health care. There has been a lot of discussion on health care and improving the quality of health care. Some of our colleagues have introduced legislation dealing with the quality of health care. I think that is important. But I think it is also very important that we actually improve quality, not improve the number of regulations. 
Today, Mr. President, Americans enjoy the highest quality of health care in the world. 
In 1993, President Clinton proposed a plan that would have devastated health care quality. It would have limited the amount of health care that Americans could receive by limiting the amount of money, whether private or public, that could be spent on health care services. It would require that everyone have the same one-size-fits-all package of health insurance benefits. And it would have enrolled everyone in managed care plans. 
Had President Clinton had his way, Americans would now be trapped in a health care system with the efficiency of the post office and the compassion of the IRS at Pentagon prices. The Republicans led the fight against President Clinton's health care plan because we believe Americans deserve the best. We believed it then and we believe it today. 
Now President Clinton wants to lead an assault on private managed care plans. The man who wanted to put everyone in an HMO now wants the Government to wage war on HMOs. That is a pretty dramatic change. But one thing has not changed: President Clinton still wants Government-run health care. As he said to the Service Employees International Union less than 5 months ago regarding his rejected universal health care program: 
If what I tried before won't work, maybe we can do it another way. That's what we've tried to do, a step at a time, until we eventually finish this. 
President Clinton is now attempting to impose on you his newest attempt at Government-run health care and masking his efforts with the name `quality.' 
Mr. President, Republicans want only the highest quality health care. But I have not seen anything to convince me that bigger Government, more regulations, and expanded bureaucratic control is the means to higher quality. 
Look at just one example of Government-controlled health care: The Medicare system. I am a member of the Finance Committee, the tax-writing committee of the Senate. We have been looking at the IRS and its treatment of taxpayers. There are 12,000 pages that deal with tax policy. I might mention, that is about 10 times the size of the Bible and, unlike the Bible, has no good news. 
Well, there are 12,000 pages dealing with tax policies. That is a lot. But, Mr. President, do you know how many pages govern Medicare? Forty-five thousand, about four times as much as we have on tax policy. That comes from Dr. Robert Waller, the Mayo Clinic, Health Care Leadership Council. Forty-five thousand pages, yet the system is archaic, inefficient, and on the path of bankruptcy despite astronomical tax increases. 
We know many people have believed they were denied coverage that their plans were supposed to cover. We recognize that some individuals fear that their health care plans will not give them access to specialists when they need them. We know that some Americans think their health care plans care more about cost than they do about quality. These are real fears of unacceptable conditions. We must do better. I think we can do better. 
But the way to do better is not by politicizing health care quality or entrusting Government bureaucrats with policing health insurers. The way to do better is to emphasize what makes our system the best in the world--employers who insist their employees have access to the best plans, doctors and hospitals who aspire to excellence, and informed consumers who will not settle for anything less than the best. Quality health care cannot be 
managed and directed from Washington, DC. 
Unfortunately, Mr. President, in the rush to respond to both real and perceived problems in managed care, members of both parties have introduced comprehensive proposals which potentially threaten--not enhance--the quality of health in our health care system. 
Some of my colleagues may ask how I can make such a statement. You only have to look back to the end of the 104th Congress to illustrate my point. A majority of Congress supported an effort last year to mandate that all insurance plans cover 48-hour maternity stays in hospitals. Many of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle felt that it was socially unacceptable to discharge newborns and mothers from the hospital after only 24 hours and crafted legislation largely around social opinion. 
Many Members felt great about voting for something positive for women and children. However, several months following the passage of that legislation an article appeared in the Journal of the American Medical Association. And here is what the clinical researchers and physicians had to say about what Congress accomplished.  
While the spirit of the current legislation may be laudable, its content does not solve the most important problems regarding the need for early postpartum/postnatal services. 
The legislation may give the public a false sense of security. It may call into question the reasonableness of relying on legislative mechanisms to micromanage clinical practice. 
Good clinical judgment, based on careful consideration of available evidence, suggests that the difference between a postpartum stay of 24 hours and a stay of 48 hours is unlikely to be a critical determinant of newborn or maternal health outcomes. 
In other words, Congress made a nice, laudable attempt. We said we are going to mandate 48 hours, but it has had no appreciable improvement on the quality of health care. 
It appears that our so-called victory in passing 48 hours may have in fact done more harm than good in helping women and newborns. This experience, and others like it, should have taught us what not to do. So what should our guiding principles be? I believe that there are three. 
Whatever the proper role for Government in the health care debate, we must assure that it does not increase health insurance premiums, reduce the number of people who have health insurance coverage, or create massive new bureaucracies that will harm health care quality. 
Why are these things important? Well, let us take a look at cost. We have a bill pending in Congress--the Patients Access to Responsible Care Act--and that is a pretty nice title. It is one of many that attempts to address health care by expanding Government control. But a recent study concluded that provisions in that bill alone would raise premiums by an average of 23 percent. That was done last year, 1997, by Milliman and Roberts. 
Let us take a look at what that means. To the average family, that is an increase of about $1,220 per year. That is over $100 per month. That is real money. And I think a lot of families cannot afford that. 
Cost is a very real issue. We do not want health care costs and prices to rise. We already know from the Congressional Budget Office that without any additional regulations at all, the growth in private health care premiums will be about 5.5 percent in 1998. That is up from 3.8 percent in 1997. So why in the world would we want to do anything that would accelerate the increase? I do not think we should. 
No. 2, we do not want to do anything that will drive people from health insurance. 
For a long time we have heard people beat up employers for not offering health care to their employees. But what are the facts? Well, someone looked into it and now we know that more employers than ever are offering health insurance. The problem is that employees are choosing not to take advantage of it because of cost. 
That came out from a study in 1997 by Cooper and Schone. 
A separate study concludes that every 1 percent increase in private health insurance premiums results in 400,000 additional uninsured Americans. That was from a 1997 Lewin study. So, 400,000 additional uninsured Americans every time health insurance premiums increase 1 percent in real terms. 
Now, wait a minute. If the PARCA bill--the Patient Access to Responsible Care Act--is estimated to increase costs by 23 percent, and every one of those percentage points equals 400,000 additional uninsured Americans, my calculations work that out to over 9 million Americans would lose their health insurance. 
Mr. President, we do not want to do that. That may not be sound science, but the potential for such an outcome would be a disaster. It is too big of a gamble, in my opinion. Higher prices and more uninsured Americans does not sound like better health care quality to me. So let us not do that. 
Thirdly, and finally, we want to make sure that the very best entity is monitoring the health care industry. And what are the options? 
Many in Congress seem to think the answer is Government, so let us talk about Government overseeing health care. I can think of a few examples of the government's bad track record. We have the Indian health care in New Mexico and Oklahoma. There is an Indian hospital in Oklahoma right now that provides, I am going to say, pathetic service. And it happens to be bankrupt. We have had this problem, in addition to Medicaid and veterans hospitals and on and on and on. I mention that Government facilities, 100 percent Government-run facilities, are not the solution. It is probably some of the poorest quality of health care, not the best quality of health care. We want to improve quality, not reduce quality.

Mr. NICKLES. Madam President, I rise today to make a couple of observations. One is that it is very apparent that there is a concerted attack on Kenneth Starr, the court-appointed independent counsel investigating several serious allegations against the Clinton administration. Some of those attacks were made today on the floor of the Senate. I believe a previous attack was made earlier in the week in the Senate. And I think Mrs. Clinton joined in the attack on Judge Starr. So, there appears to be a concerted attempt by the President, his staff, his wife, and others to attack Kenneth Starr as the independent counsel. I just think that is inappropriate. 
Just for the information of my colleagues, I have known Ken Starr. I understand that he clerked for the Supreme Court for Chief Justice Warren Burger when he got out of law school. I got to know him when he was assistant and chief of staff to Attorney General William French Smith during the Reagan administration. That is the first time I got to know him. And I remember him when he served as Solicitor General of the United States and argued cases on behalf of the United States before the Supreme Court. I happened to sit in on one or two. In one case that I remember in particular, he did a very fine job. He represented the United States very well. I don't remember anybody ever making any allegations that he was a right-wing conspirator at that time. 
He served as a judge on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals with Justices Scalia and Ginsburg, and he served with distinction. I don't remember hearing one scintilla of negative comments of his service there. 
He was chosen--and this is interesting--by the Senate to review Senator Packwood's diaries that dealt with a sex scandal in the Senate. That was a very sensitive issue and not an easy one. And probably not a job that he had any interest in doing either. But it shows that, yes, he handled that, and he handled it very professionally. I think everyone in the Senate would have to acknowledge that. 
Judge Starr has taught constitutional law at New York University Law School, a very prestigious law school. He was chosen by the three-judge court to take over as independent counsel and replace Robert Fiske in his investigation of Whitewater and related matters. He was chosen for this job by the court. I don't believe he campaigned for it. He was selected by a three-judge panel. 
So he worked for the Senate, he worked in the Attorney General's office, in the Solicitor General's office, he served as a judge, and he taught--all of which he did with distinction. 
So I really regret that many people in the administration, and now some of our colleagues, are attacking Ken Starr--impugning his motives, raising charges of conflict of interest, and so on. I think that is really unfortunate. 
I happen to also think it is intended as a diversion. I think it is a pattern that we have seen followed by this administration time and time again when they are feeling pressure from an investigation or emerging scandal. 
It is unfortunate, but this administration has been plagued by scandals since prior to President Clinton's election in 1992. It seems like there is a repetitive pattern of attacking whoever that scandal happens to be involved with--whether it was Gennifer Flowers, when she was attacked; Paula Jones, when she was attacked; the FBI, when investigating the FBI files matter. A couple FBI people lost their jobs over that unfortunate incident. The travel office employees were attacked, when Billy Dale was investigated. The Justice Department was called in to investigate Billy Dale. So time and time again, it seems like there is a pattern that if there is a complaint, we all of a sudden start hearing negative stories. 
When it became well known that FBI Director Louis Freeh's 
recommendation was that an independent counsel should be appointed to investigate possible campaign abuses by the Clinton administration, all of a sudden we start hearing negative stories about Director Freeh and the White House's lack of confidence in his work. There was even some speculation that he would be fired. Well, he could not be fired, he had a 10-year term. I think it is very unfortunate. 
Mrs. Clinton was on television talking about a `right-wing conspiracy,' and about all these groups spreading stories. I don't think Ken Starr has anything to do with any alleged right-wing conspiracy, nothing whatsoever. I don't think he has ever had that strong of a political philosophy or involvement with partisan issues. He has been a judge, he has been working at the Justice Department and teaching law school. I just don't think that's the case. I certainly don't think that the President's own personal secretary was part of a right-wing conspiracy. So I am just bothered by that. 
I think that we see a concerted effort by the administration to have a diversion. Certainly this latest scandal is serious. There were allegations that were brought to Ken Starr's attention, and he took them to the Attorney General for authority to investigate. She gave a recommendation to the three-judge court to expand his authority to investigate. Janet Reno recommended to the three-judge panel that these latest allegations concerning the sex scandal be investigated. That is what Ken Starr is doing. 
So I hope that my colleagues will tone down their rhetoric. I hope this administration will tone down the rhetoric and quit attacking Ken Starr and maybe cooperate with the investigation and let the facts be known. 
I hope that nothing happened. I hope that there is nothing to this scandal. But I think the President should tell the truth. I think that the American people are entitled to the truth and, hopefully, it will come out very shortly. Then we can go on and do the Nation's business--as the President has called for. But when there are allegations of perjury, or obstruction of justice, coaching witnesses, or trying to get people to leave town so maybe they would not testify--these are serious charges. I might remind colleagues that President Nixon was on the road to impeachment not because he broke into the Watergate, but because of charges of perjury, tampering with a witness and obstruction of justice. 
So these are serious charges, but they don't need to be investigated on the floor of the Senate. It is possible that at some point the Senate will have a role; I don't know. But I don't think it is proper or right to have this campaign of attack and smear on Ken Starr. I think it undermines the judicial process and really undermines those people who are making such charges. Madam President, I hope that our colleagues and others will allow the independent counsel to do his work. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, during the President's State of the Union speech, as well as in the submission of the budget, there have been a lot of accolades about a balanced budget. Many of us have worked for a long, long time to see a balanced budget. It has been kind of interesting, with different people taking credit for it. The President said he has done it since has been in office, that the deficit has come down every year. The Republicans have said after they took control in the '94 elections, that is when we really saw the deficits reduce. 
I would like to put some facts into the Record, dealing both with the President's budget and also the source of the decline of the deficit since January of 1995. In the budget deficit of 1995, submitted by President Clinton, in January of 1995, it showed that the deficit was estimated to be $176 billion in 1995; in 1996, it was supposed to be, or estimated to be $207 billion; in 1997, $224 billion; $222 billion in '98; $253 billion in '99; $284 billion in 2000; $297 billion in 2001; $322 billion in the year 2002. This is President Clinton's budget. That was what he submitted to Congress in January of 1995. 
Now, you had something happen in November of '94, which is that the Republicans were elected to take control of Congress. That was the change. This already takes into account the President's large tax increase of 1993. So that is already computed in here. In spite of his large tax increase, deficits continued to increase, from $176 billion in '95 to an estimated $322 billion in the year 2002. 
I make a point of that because I have heard several administrative officials testifying, `Yes, we brought the deficit down and did it because of that historic tax increase of 1993.' I just beg to differ. The facts were that the policies showed that the deficit was going to continue to climb significantly. What happened since 1995? That is what this chart will show. We have had some tax cuts. The tax cut that was passed--actually, there was one passed in '95, but the President vetoed it. So there is no change in '95 and '96, as far as the Tax Code. Congress did pass, and the President signed, a tax reduction effort last year. This chart will show the net effect of that. Frankly, it is not very large. In between the years 1997 and 2002, it is a net tax cut of $75 billion. So that didn't have a lot of difference on what happened in the economy. 
Spending cuts over that same period of time, between the year 1995 and 2002, was $276 billion. So that didn't have a lot. The primary difference was re-estimates--re-estimates. I am using CBO data, Congressional Budget Office data. The difference of technical and economic assumptions is $1.567 trillion over those same years. And so, yes, the economy has done better, and the estimates were off. The growth rates have been higher, revenues have been higher. That is the principal source of deficit reduction. Again, I am not even trying to offer a lot of my own opinion. I am just trying to show that here is the deficit projection given by CBO in January of 1995. Here is the CBO deficit baseline in January of 1998, 3 years apart, 
but a total of a couple of trillion dollars difference in their net results. 
Now, Mr. President, I would like to talk about the President's budget that he submitted to Congress. He made the statement that he did not want one dime to be spent that would increase the national debt--not one dime. Under the President's proposal, he has $124 billion, actually $124.1 billion, between the year 1998 and the year 2003, that 5-year period of time, that would increase the debt by new spending. And $70.9 billion of that is discretionary spending--including mandatory, a total of $124 billion of new spending, spending over and above what we have in present law, spending over and above what is now contemplated, spending over and above what was agreed upon last year. 
I might mention, as far as the discretionary spending, last year we entered into an agreement that said here is how much we are going to spend in discretionary spending every year. The President is violating that agreement by his submission of the budget. 
Now, the budget was balanced, but yet in the budget that we agreed upon last year, one of the reasons it is balanced is because basically we froze, or came close to freezing discretionary spending. He is calling for increases in discretionary spending above what was agreed upon last year. He calls for $124 billion in new spending. He also has tax cuts that really also would have an increasing impact on the deficit of $24.2 billion. 
If you add the two together, the President's proposal that he made in his budget and in the State of the Union, if you took the new spending and the tax cuts, which are really, in my opinion, using the Tax Code to spend money, it would have a negative impact on the deficit of $148.3 billion over this period of time.

Mr. NICKLES. Madam President, as we move toward adjournment in the first session of the 105th Congress, I want to take a couple of minutes to look ahead at one of the real big challenges that we have next year. That issue is tobacco and the so-called global tobacco deal that was agreed to earlier this year between the tobacco industry, States attorneys general, and health advocates. 
Madam President, we have seen a significant sea change in our culture's attitudes toward smoking in the last 30 years. The proportion of adult smokers peaked at 43 percent in 1966 and has dropped dramatically since then to about 25 percent today. According to the Federal Trade Commission, demand for cigarettes is forecast to continue to decline about 0.6 percent a year for the foreseeable future. 
However, as adult use has declined, concern has grown about the number of underage smokers who every day try their first cigarette. Madam President, 4.5 million kids ages 12 to17 are current smokers, according to the Department of Health and Human Services; 29 percent of males age 12 to 21, and 26 percent of females in the same age group currently smoke, according to reports of the National Center for Health Statistics. In 1994, the Surgeon General's report found that 9 out of 10 Americans who currently smoke say they began smoking as teenagers. Many Americans share a common goal to reduce teen smoking dramatically to break the cycle of smoking as we enter into the 21st century. Members of Congress, Republican and Democrat, too, would like to see our children smoke free and families free from fear of smoke-related cancers and disease. 
The agreement between the tobacco industry and States attorneys general was motivated by good intentions, but it resulted in a deal that is very complicated. In the Senate, several committees have held numerous hearings trying to elicit more information and understanding of the agreement. 
Since the Clinton administration was intimately involved in crafting the June 20 deal, we were hopeful that the President would come forward with specific recommendations and legislation to describe how the deal would work. 
Unfortunately, the President ducked a historic opportunity for leadership. Rather than following the regular order of submitting legislation, he sent us five vague principles. His inaction set back the work of the Congress considerably. 
I remain hopeful that the President and his administration will tell us specifically what he wants in legislation. For now, though, the Congress has to do the heavy lifting. We have to make our own decisions about how the various elements of the deal should be put together. 
Through the summer and fall, I met several times with Senate committee chairmen who have jurisdiction over the major elements of the deal. They include the Committees of Agriculture, Commerce, Finance, Labor, Judiciary, Environment and Public Works, as well as Indian Affairs. 
I have requested that, when we reconvene next year, they begin work and try to find out what the majority in their committees, Republicans and Democrats, believe are important elements of a comprehensive plan targeted on reducing teenage smoking. I have asked them to conclude their work by March 16, 1998, and they have agreed to meet that timetable.

Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I rise to express my profound disappointment in the action the President took on November 1 of this year when he used his veto pen to line-item veto $900,000 from the VA-HUD appropriations bill. This money was set aside for the final planning and design of a new national veterans cemetery to be built at Fort Sill in Lawton, OK. While I am disappointed, I know my disappointment pales in comparison to the shock and frustration that the veterans of Oklahoma and their families have expressed to me and my staff regarding the President's action. 
The shock and frustration expressed by veterans living in Oklahoma who have selflessly served our country and their families comes because the President's veto will further delay a national cemetery that has been in one stage of planning or another since 1987 when the Department of Veteran Affairs stated its intention to build a new national cemetery in Oklahoma. 
I hope my colleagues will bear with me as I review what the veterans of Oklahoma and their families have gone through over the past 10 years. 
Efforts to establish a national veterans cemetery in central Oklahoma date back to 1987. That year the Department of Veterans Affairs, in a report to Congress, identified central Oklahoma as an area in need of a national veterans cemetery because of Oklahoma's large veterans population and an official acknowledgment that the Fort Gibson cemetery in eastern Oklahoma would soon be full. The Oklahoma congressional delegation did not make this determination, Oklahoma's large veteran population did not make this determination the VA made this determination. 
The VA then embarked on a 4-year selection process and narrowed the potential cemetery sites to three: Fort Reno, Edmond, and Guthrie. The Congress, in accordance with the 1987 report, appropriated $250,000 in fiscal year 1991 for the purpose of conducting an environmental impact statement on these three sites to determine which site best met the needs of our veterans and was suitable for construction of a cemetery. 
In late 1993, the VA officially announced Fort Reno as its preferred site, and Congress, in 1994, appropriated another $250,000 for the initial planning and design stages of the cemetery. Unfortunately, in that same year a land dispute arose over the Fort Reno site. After a year of trying to work out an agreement on the property at Fort Reno no resolution could be found. 
On January 23, 1995, the VA issued a press release announcing that it was no longer committed to the Fort Reno site because the land dispute could not be resolved. In that same press release Jesse Brown, the Secretary of Veterans Affairs, made the following statement:  
I am reiterating VA's commitment to provide a new national cemetery for the veterans of this region. We will look for other potential sites and expedite the selection decision. 
Thankfully, another piece of property was soon found at Fort Sill that could be used for a cemetery, and true to Secretary Brown's statement the process was expedited. 
The VA, using money left over from the initial environmental impact statement, conducted another study of the piece of property identified as a potential cemetery site at Fort Sill. The second environmental impact statement was completed on the property at Fort Sill and it was deemed suitable for a cemetery. 
Again, acting on the VA's commitment of 1987 to build a national veterans cemetery which was reiterated in January 1995, by Secretary Brown, the Congress adopted an amendment that I offered to the fiscal year 1997 Defense authorization bill that called for the transfer of that property at Fort Sill for the establishment of a new national veterans cemetery. 
I recently spoke to the Army and was informed that this land transfer is progressing very well and ought to be complete by mid-January of 1998--that's about two months away. 
This year I worked with my good friend, Senator Bond, chairman of the VA-HUD appropriations subcommittee, to include $900,000 for the final planning and design of the cemetery. It was included in the bill that was passed by the Senate and included in the conference report. 
As I stated earlier, about a week ago, the President used his veto pen to line-item veto this project. This project was the only VA project that was line-tem vetoed this year. 
Besides being disappointed at the President's action, I don't understand it. The cemetery project is completely within the budget agreement that was hammered out this year. The cemetery project was identified by the VA as a project it wanted. 
I do want to let the administration and the veterans of Oklahoma know that I am committed to this project and I intend to work with the administration and the VA to see that the veterans of Oklahoma get a new national veterans cemetery in a timely fashion. Ten years has already been a long time to wait. The veterans of Oklahoma and their families have endured much as they served our country, I intend to see to it that the establishment of a new national veterans cemetery does not become yet another test of that endurance. 
Mr. President, I believe the President made a mistake. He made a mistake in several items that were vetoed in the MilCon bill and he made a mistake in this case. The VA had made a commitment to build this cemetery. The veterans who served our country so well are entitled to be buried in a national veterans' cemetery. The Veterans' Department said maybe the new cemetery in Oklahoma should be a State cemetery. However, the veterans of Oklahoma have stated they want to be buried in a national veterans' cemetery, and I am committed to that. I know the veterans of Oklahoma are committed to that. We have had a commitment from this administration and this administration should not renege on it. They should not go back on their word to the veterans of Oklahoma, as evidenced by the President's veto. I think it was a mistake. 
It just so happens the President does not have a Secretary of Veterans' Affairs. I will be meeting with the Acting Secretary and the President's nominee to be Secretary and hopefully we will come to an understanding very quickly that this is a commitment that will be completed. We need to uphold the commitment we made to the veterans of Oklahoma that we will have a national cemetery built.

They have worked very well together this session. We had some real trials and tribulations, but I think, together, they were an outstanding combination. They were able to pass the Nation's important business, such as the budget and historic tax relief. 
I think this was a productive Congress. Again, I wish to compliment the majority and minority leaders for their effort and leadership.

Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, our colleague from Nebraska, I think, made the same request yesterday, and maybe some of the same comments were made yesterday. If we didn't have additional ideas to make the legislation better, I would agree with him, because I think the House passed some good legislation. I think we can make it better. Chairman Roth mentioned a couple things we can do. 
We had good hearings. Actually, the hearings that promulgated a lot of the IRS reforms happened in the Senate, not in the House. Our House colleagues, as the Constitution provides, initiates revenue measures. So they have acted and they have acted promptly. I congratulate Chairman Archer, who I think does an outstanding job as the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee. The House has done good work and passed a good, bipartisan bill. 
Likewise, we can do good work in the Senate and pass a bipartisan bill. We might do better. We might add and build upon what the House has in their legislation. We heard from a lot of things. Mr. Dolan, the acting Commissioner of the IRS, had some suggestions, brought out some points. We had witnesses who talked about IRS abuse. I think we can build upon some of the changes that the House has advocated and make a better bill, but it may take a little bit of time to do it. I would like to do it and do it right. 
Again, I appreciate what our colleague from Nebraska is saying, but I would very much like and happen to agree with the chairman, I think we would be better off if we allow the Finance Committee to mark up the legislation, make some improvements, and pass legislation that, again, will, hopefully, receive bipartisan support and the President's signature as well.

Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I want to make a couple of comments. One pertains to the IRS proposal. I think Senator Kerrey's assessment of the House-passed language is correct. It is good language. But I certainly agree with the chairman of the Finance Committee. We had outstanding hearings conducted in a very fair, bipartisan way that said we should do more. I think Chairman Roth said we want to do more, demand to do more, and I think we can do better. The House passed a very good bill. We passed a better bill. 
I tell my colleagues. We want to continue to work together in a bipartisan fashion to pass really good IRS restructuring reform in this Congress. I hope and expect we will.

Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I also want to make a comment concerning Senator Bond, and the outstanding work he has done in the Environment and Public Works Committee to pass the highway bill. We need to pass one this year. The Senator from Missouri has been working with Senator Baucus and others in a bipartisan fashion, and I believe it has unanimous support in the Environment and Public Works Committee to pass a reauthorization bill, or at least passing an extension for 6 months to allow the States to continue contracting. 
They came up with a way that said, `Well, we are not going to have one side win on the formula issue, or another side.' I think it is a good compromise until we pass a 6-year bill, which we tried to do. 
I might mention that we had four cloture votes on whether or not we would take up the highway bill, and it was basically filibustered because people wanted to add campaign reform and unrelated issues. That is unfortunate. That is history. Now we have to move on. We only have a few days to do it. 
I compliment my colleague from Missouri, and others who have worked with him, and I urge our House colleagues to work together with us to make sure we get this passed. Let's pass this before we leave. I think it is vitally important to the highway programs in every single State in the Nation.

Mr. NICKLES. Finally, Mr. President, let me conclude on the DOD authorization bill. We just had a resounding vote of 90 to 10 on the Department of Defense authorization bill on which Senator Thurmond has worked, and many other colleagues have been working on for a long time--a year. They put in a lot of work. They have a good bill. It is a bill the President should sign. I urge the President to sign it. 
On the depot issue, which has been very contentious amongst a few States, I think we came up with a fair compromise. I think we came up with a compromise that allows States to compete, and to compete fairly. 
So I compliment all Senators involved. I urge the President to sign the Department of Defense authorization bill to allow our military people to receive the cost-of-living adjustment, and to allow authorization to go forward on many very important military projects all across our country.

Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, it is a longstanding tradition in the Senate to recognize and honor those Senators who serve as Presiding Officers of the Senate for 100 hours in a single session of Congress. Today, we add to the list of Golden Gavel recipients Senator Allard of Colorado, whose presiding hours total 100 hours today. 
November 5 is a very significant date for Senator Allard and his family, as on November 5, 1996, 1 year ago today, Senator Allard was elected to the U.S. Senate. Therefore, it is an appropriate date to recognize his contributions as a Presiding Officer of the Senate. 
With respect to presiding, Senator Allard has been extremely generous with his time and has often rearranged his schedule at a moment's notice--and, I might add, with the assistance of his very courteous staff--to assist in presiding when difficulties arise. As a Presiding Officer, his dedication and dependability are to be commended. It is a great pleasure to announce Senator Wayne Allard of Colorado as recipient of the Senate's Golden Gavel Award. 
My compliments to my friend, my colleague, and the Presiding Officer.

That is on the DOD conference report. 
Beyond that, I am not prepared to tell my colleague what--I know the House is planning on voting on the fast-track authorization on Friday. There is some discussion that since that is a House bill and we are working on the Senate bill, we might entertain taking up the House bill when it passes so we wouldn't be working on two different bills.

Mr. NICKLES. First, let me respond to my colleague, Senator Dorgan. I hear what the Senator is saying. I know that the Senator has some amendments he wishes to offer on fast track. I know that we wish to pass fast track. We also wish to pass Amtrak reform and we also wish to pass all the appropriations bills, and we only have a couple of days. So we are going to try to accommodate everybody's requests. But the highest priority I believe will be to pass the appropriations conference reports as soon as possible. I believe the D.C. bill will be the first one up. That is not a conference report. It is a bill. But I think we have an agreement on D.C., so we will get that one accomplished. Hopefully then we will have three other conference reports we will be able to do in the next day or two, and we will have, I am sure, some additional time for my colleague to spend on fast track as well.

Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, today, I am introducing the Candy Lake Land Conveyance Act of 1997. The purpose of this legislation is to direct the Secretary of the Army to convey lands acquired for the Candy Lake project in Osage County, OK, back to the original landowners. 
Briefly, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers acquired 3,657.45 acres of land in Osage County from 21 landowners for the purpose of constructing Candy Lake. The project was not constructed, and in December 1996, the Corps of Engineers declared the Candy Lake property excess to the needs of the Federal Government. 
My legislation will give each of the 21 landowners the option to purchase their original property from the Federal Government at fair market value. If a landowner, or their descendant, opts not to purchase their former property, that land will be disposed of in accordance with the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 (40 U.S.C. 471 et seq.).

Members can therefore expect a cloture vote at approximately 12 noon today. Assuming cloture is not invoked, the Senate may then proceed to S. 1173, the so-called highway transportation bill, ISTEA legislation. It is also possible the Senate will resume consideration of the D.C. appropriations bill if the two remaining issues can be resolved. The Senate may also consider any appropriations conference reports that may be available. Therefore, Members can anticipate additional rollcall votes throughout today's session of the Senate.

Mr. NICKLES. The majority leader has yielded so that I may ask a question. Your request was to move to the District of Columbia appropriations bill. Correct me if I am wrong, but that is the last appropriations bill we haven't passed. We passed the other 12, and we passed a continuing resolution. The continuing resolution will expire on the 23d of this month. So it is your hope that we can dispose of the District of Columbia appropriations bill, hopefully, tonight; is that correct?

Mr. NICKLES. And dispose of--I believe there is the Coats amendment pending and also a Mack proposal pending. So if we can dispose of both of those amendments, finish the District of Columbia appropriations bill, let it go to conference, and hopefully work out the differences with the House on that and several other conference reports, as many as possible this week, hopefully complete all those by the 23d, maybe we won't need a continuing resolution. It looks like there may be a couple of bills that we may not be able to finish by the 23d. It is your hope that we can finish the D.C. bill tonight?

Mr. NICKLES. The majority leader made some comments on the campaign finance reform and paycheck protection. I know my colleague the minority leader said he wanted to have more discussion. I will tell my colleague that I would like to visit about that a little bit more as well. I think every American should be guaranteed the right to say whether or not they contribute to a campaign. I can't imagine that any employees have money taken away from them on a monthly basis without their consent. I think that is un-American. 
I personally inform the majority leader and tell my colleague from South Dakota, I think it is a very fundamental question of freedom, and I feel very strongly about it. I am happy to discuss that with our colleagues and, hopefully, figure out a way to pass it. Two or three of my colleagues say maybe it should be amended. I am happy to discuss that with them as well. I never said it was 
perfect. I think we should have a fundamental question of fairness. Should we not have the right or the opportunity to make sure that everybody that contributes to a political campaign does it on a voluntary basis? 
So I appreciate the majority leader's responding to my question. I know he wants to set this aside as far as campaign reforms and pass the appropriations bill. I concur with that. 
But just to ask the majority leader a question, does he agree with me that every American should have the right to be able to contribute to a campaign on a voluntary basis?

Mr. NICKLES. I thank the Chairman. It has become evident that OIRA has not been implementing and coordinating the Congressional Review Act despite its organizing statute and President Clinton's Executive order. To make the Congressional Review Act work, Congress and the agencies need OIRA's expertise to coordinate agency input to the General Accounting Office on the new rules they promulgate. The General Accounting Office has reported to us that they have been frustrated by OIRA's refusal to work with them in their role of helping Congress understand the impact of each major rule.

Mr. NICKLES. I thank my colleague from Georgia. It is a pleasure to serve on the Governmental Affairs Committee with him. He is one of the members, as well as the Senator from Connecticut, who spends a lot of time on the committee and does a very good job, I will say, in really trying to find out what has happened and what the facts are. 
Mr. President, just a few general comments on campaign reform. Everybody says, `Well, now we change the law. It's vitally important for us to change the law.' I think it is more important, and maybe the best campaign reform that we could have would be enforcement of the existing law. 
Why in the world, if the statutes are very clear on the books--and some people say they are ambiguous; I think I will show in a moment they are not that ambiguous--why in the world should we be worried about changing the law if we are not going to enforce the law as it is written? 
We have numerous cases that, I believe clearly, laws were broken, and in some cases flagrantly broken, and yet we have seen almost no enforcement from this administration, and yet they are out there beating the drum, saying, `Change the law. Change the law.' It reminds me of something like somebody has been robbing banks and says, `Oh, yes, let's have a tougher law against bank robbing. Oh, yeah, I've been doing it a long time. Oh, yeah, if I get caught, I'll send the money back.' I don't think that is good enough. 
As a matter of fact, this administration has been caught with their hand in the cookie jar for millions of dollars. They have sent millions of dollars back, and they say, `Well, that's OK.' Well, I do not think that is OK. 
If the law has been broken, it should be enforced. If we would enforce the law, if we would actually indict people, if we would arrest people, if we would seek their participation and comments before a grand jury, I think that would do more for campaign reform than any of the bills that we have before us. 
And we have a lot of bills, good bills I will say, Democrat bills, Republican bills. Before we do that, we have several statutes that are on the books that ought to be enforced. Frankly, they have not been enforced. You might say, `Well, give me an example.' 
One that has been kind of famous is 18 United States Code 607: prohibits soliciting and receiving contributions in Government building. 
I know we heard from Mr. Sandler, who is general counsel for the Democratic National Committee say--well, he interprets that to mean that you can be in a Federal building, you can make all the phone calls you want on hard money, soft money, as long as you are calling somebody that does not happen to be a Federal employee in a Federal building, that you can do it. 
That is an absurd reading of the statute. I do not see how an intelligent person can read the statute and come to that conclusion, but that is the Democratic National Committee's general counsel, that was his general summary. It seems to be the advice that the Vice President has followed, to say he has broken no law. 
But the law is very clear. It says it should be unlawful for any person to solicit or receive campaign contributions in a Federal building, period. If you look further, the definition of `contribution,' is `money received to influence an election.' So I think they have broken the law. 
Maybe we will just ignore the law and say there is no controlling legal authority because that law has not been enforced. But my guess is no other administration in history has ever broken the law like this administration, never abused the law, never pushed the envelope. I think they pushed well beyond the envelope. I do not think it is into the gray area. I do not think it is a couple cases where somebody called you back and, `Well, yes, we'd like for you to host something.' I think this was systematic, flagrant--`Let's raise a lot of money.' I believe very much that the President and the Vice President were involved in it. The President had a memo that said, `Start the overnighters at $50,000 and $100,000.' I happen to think that is the silver bullet people are talking about. 
The President of the United States said, `Let's start the coffees.' He is talking about raising money. They had 103 coffees. They raised $26.4 million. In the President's own handwriting he said, `Start them.' Guess what, they started right after he said, `Start them.' `Start the overnighters'--they started the overnighters. They had hundreds of people spending the night, hundreds of people spending the night in the White House, more than any other administration, a volume that they have never seen before. And a whole lot of them were contributing $100,000. We had the FBI testify that 51 averaged over $107,000 each to spend the night in the White House. I happen to think that is a flagrant violation of the current law, the law as it is written right now. 
We could just go on and on. 
And 18 United States Code 600: prohibits promising any Government benefit in return for political support. Johnny Chung is reported to have donated $25,000 to Ms. O'Leary's favorite charity at her direction in order for Mr. Chung to obtain a meeting with several Chinese businessmen. He contributed the money. He got the meeting. Ms. O'Leary's charity got the $25,000. He also donated more than $360,000 to the DNC from 1994 to 1996. 
And 2 United States Code 441(e): prohibits a foreign national from making a political contribution either directly or through another person. Also prohibits anyone from accepting such contributions. 
Pauline Kanchanalak contributed $135,000 which the DNC had to return when it was revealed the contribution was actually from her mother-in-law. She visited the White House 26 times, she testified. Yet, has she been before a grand jury? Has this administration done anything to compel her testimony for laundering funds? I do not think so. 
Charlie Trie contributed $789,000 to the President's legal defense fund which we heard testimony that some of the checks were laundered through a Taiwan-based religious sect, Suma Ching Hai. He also received a steady stream of wire transfers from foreign sources from 1994 to 1996, totally $1.4 million, some of which came from Mr. Wu, his Macao-based business partner. 
Some people said, `Well, we haven't seen any foreign money.' They have not had their eyes opened. 
Mr. Trie had a lot of foreign money, $1.4 million, wired in, and he had great access. This is a person who is a Little Rock restaurant businessman. And all of a sudden he is spending millions of dollars, had unbelievable access to the White House. He visited the White House at least 37 times. He received a Presidential appointment to a foreign policy commission, one that the President had to expand the number of commissioners so he could serve on it. 
John Huang directed a $50,000 contribution to the DNC through Hip Hing Holdings which was reimbursed from Lippo's Indonesian headquarters. John Huang and a DNC fundraiser, Maria Hsia `Shaw,' collected $100,000 to $140,000 from Vice President Gore's Buddhist Temple fundraiser of which half had to be ordered returned from foreign sources. A lot of that money was laundered as we found out through testimony. It happens to be illegal. 
United States Code 201: prohibits any Federal official from receiving any benefit in return for official action. Johnny Chung brought in six Chinese officials to hear the President's radio address and gave the First Lady's chief of staff a $50,000 check in the same week that he was able to get them in. In exchange for $50,000, they were able to attend the radio address. That happens to be illegal. Has Mr. Chung been indicted? Has he been brought before a grand jury? Has he testified before the Senate committee? No. 
Mr. Chung made a statement, `I see the White House like a subway; you have to put in the coins to open the gates.' 
I could go on and talk about Charlie Trie getting a Chinese arms dealer into a White House coffee with President Clinton. Only 4 days before the coffee, it is reported, Mr. Huang's arms trading company received special permission to import 100,000 special assault weapons, although there was a ban on the importation of these assault weapons. 
United States Code 7201 prohibits evasion of income tax; United States Code 371 prohibits conspiracy to defraud the United States. The Buddhist temple is a tax-exempt organization. They made contributions to Vice President Gore, they made contributions to other colleagues in this body, they made contributions at the DNC with tax-exempt dollars. People were getting tax deductions, writing checks to the Buddhist temple, and the Buddhist temple wrote political checks. Everybody else in the country who writes political checks has to do it with after-tax dollars. In this case, people got a tax deduction for contributing to a Buddhist temple, and it was the Buddhist temple who was making contributions. 
That is wrong. That is against the law. That is against the IRS Code. I just quoted the IRS Code. Who has been indicted on that? This is an egregious violation of the law. It has happened time and time again. 
My point is we need campaign reform. In my opinion, one of the best steps we could take toward campaign reform would be to enforce the existing law. Maybe we should enforce the existing law and find out where its shortcomings might be before we try to expand the law or redefine the law or change the law. 
Now, Mr. President, I want to make a couple of comments concerning the legislation that we have before the Senate, the so-called McCain-Feingold legislation. First, let me compliment the authors of the legislation because I think they made some steps in the right direction. They have improved it and taken off, as I can see, the spending caps. They have taken off the ban which, incidentally, I think is clearly unconstitutional. They have taken off the ban on PAC's, political action committees. Those are steps in the right direction. 
They did a couple of things, though, that need to be improved upon, one of which is they said, well, we are going to codify Beck. We are going to make sure union members can get their money back. That is the language I have heard bandied about on the floor. Mr. President, that is not good enough. 
I firmly believe we should make sure that all Americans have voluntary contributions to campaigns. No Americans should be compelled to contribute to a campaign, whether they work for a business, whether they are a member of the union, or whether they are not a member. Some say that is an antiunion provision, a killer amendment. I beg to differ. If we are going to pass campaign reform this year, we will pass a provision that makes campaign contributions voluntary for all Americans. 
I feel very, very strongly about this. You might say, where did this come from? It came from a town meeting I had in Collinsville, OK, when an employee of American Airlines held his hand up, and one of the first questions he asked was, `Senator Nickles, I really don't like my money being taken away from me on a monthly basis without consent to be used to elect people and support issues I don't agree with. That is not America. That is not right.' The company the person worked for happened to be American Airlines. He happened to be what some people 
call a blue-collar, middle-income American. He is a great American. He is a union guy. He is prounion. He just wants to have a voice on whether or not he is going to contribute to a political party or not. 
I happen to agree with that. I happen to be a Republican, but I don't want anybody taking my money to spend it for political purposes without my consent. It would be over my body. I don't think anybody should be compelled to contribute to a different campaign or to a campaign they don't agree with. If you are going to have compulsory campaign contributions, you have lost real freedom, you have lost your political freedom. To say, `We will give you information on how you can get a refund,' is not satisfactory. That is after the fact. That is after your money has already been taken away from you, spent in a way you didn't like, and, `Oh, yes, you can file for a refund. Incidentally, you have to go through a lot of trouble if you file.' 
Guess what? You can't be a member of the union. Under the Beck language we have in the McCain bill and under the language that is currently out, if you get a refund, you have to be basically a nonunion member. You can't vote in union elections. You can't decide who would be president of that union. You can't have any impact on the collective bargaining strategy. Maybe you want to be a member of the union. Maybe it is the thing to do, but you disagree with the union's political agenda. Right now you don't have a choice. You can't have both. You can't be in the union and say, `No, I don't want my money going to elect liberal Democrats or to elect people who have a social agenda that I disagree with.' You don't have that option under current law. 
We will change that. If we are going to have campaign reform this year, we will have the underlining promise that all campaign contributions will be voluntary, period. Every employee that works for any company should know his campaign contributions will be voluntary. If he doesn't want to make them, he doesn't have to make them, period, whether they are a member of the union, not a member of the union, whether they work for a company that doesn't have a union, they should all know, nobody should be compelled to contribute to a political campaign against their will. Nobody. 
So that is one of the amendments we have up here. I don't look at it as a killer amendment. I tell my colleagues I am willing to negotiate. I heard Senator McCain say he is willing to negotiate. I am willing to negotiate. Senator Lott asked me to see if we couldn't work out a bipartisan bill. I am willing to work with my colleagues. 
I mentioned earlier, I think the McCain-Feingold bill took some steps in the right direction. I think it maybe has a couple of steps further to go. This is one of them. This is one of them. If we are going to have campaign reform, in this Senator's opinion, it will have to start with the premise that all campaign contributions will be voluntary; make sure that no one is compelled. 
Then what else can we do? We can do a lot of things. Some say ban soft money, others have proposals to limit soft money. Some say allow individuals to do more. Some people have ideas requiring that a certain percentage has to be raised within an individual's home State or district. I think all those things are legitimate for discussion. Let's put them all on the table. Some people have a proposal that says you can't contribute to 
campaigns unless you can legally vote. I think that is a good proposal. Other people want to have free TV time. I don't happen to agree with that. Some people want to have subsidized TV or half-rate TV for political candidates. I don't agree with that. 
I am willing to talk about it. I am willing to negotiate. I am willing to negotiate everything I mentioned, but the one fundamental thing I draw a line on is that the campaign contributions have to be voluntary. 
I take issue with anybody who says that is an antiunion bill. That is a proworker provision. That is a profreedom provision. It is basically saying no one should be compelled to contribute to a campaign against their will. That is a fundamental American freedom. We should be ashamed of ourselves for making anybody be compelled to contribute to a campaign against their will. 
We will fix that. I hope we will fix it. I believe we will fix it. I also believe that will be part of our bill, and then I will tell my colleagues I don't look at it as a killer amendment, because I'm willing to work with them to try to pass real, substantive campaign reform. 
Keep it constitutional, do not limit speech, encourage participation, make it possible for more people to participate, do not come up with a system that guarantees incumbents' advantage. I am more than willing to do other things that would limit incumbents' advantage. We can say, incumbents, you can't do any mailings in an election year. That will crimp it down a little bit. Incumbents, you cannot have carryover funds. We can do a lot of things for real campaign reform that we could pass in a bipartisan fashion. 
I believe one fundamental freedom should exist that we should all agree on, Democrats and Republicans, and that is that all campaign contributions should be voluntary. That is the reason why we have the Paycheck Protection Act. We don't want anybody reaching into your back pocket, taking your money out, and spending it for political purposes unless you say OK. That is your back pocket. You are the one who worked hard; you are the one who put the money in there. Nobody--no group, no association, no employer--should be able to reach in and say, `I will take a little bit out and spend it the way I want without your permission.' We will protect your paycheck and let you have control over it. That will be part of this bill. It will be the first amendment I believe we will vote on. 
I urge my colleagues to vote for it.

<TEXT>
Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, on behalf of myself and the cosponsor of this legislation, Senator Inhofe, the legislation we passed today, S. 871, the Oklahoma City National Memorial Act of 1997, will create a permanent Memorial to commemorate the national tragedy ingrained in all of our minds that occurred in downtown Oklahoma City at 9:02 a.m. on April 19, 1995, in which 168 Americans lost their lives and countless thousands more lost family members and friends. 
The Oklahoma City memorial, established as a unit of the National Park Service, will serve as a monument to those whose lives were taken and those who will bear the physical and mental scars for the rest of their days. The memorial will stand as a symbol to the hope, generosity, and courage shown by Oklahomans and fellow Americans across the country following the Oklahoma City bombing. This will be a place of remembrance, peace, spirituality, comfort and learning. 
The National Park Service memorial site will encompass the footprint of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building, 5th Street between Robinson and Harvey, the site of the Water Resources Building and the Journal Record Building. An international competition was held to determine the design of the Oklahoma City National Memorial, and I commend the Oklahoma City Memorial Foundation for an excellent selection of the winning design. 
In addition to designating the memorial site as a unit of the National Park Service, this bill also establishes a wholly owned Government corporation to be known as the Oklahoma City National Memorial Trust. The trust, in cooperation with the National Park Service, will be charged with administering the operation, maintenance, management and interpretation of the memorial site. 
Further, the legislation authorizes a one-time $5 million Federal donation for construction and maintenance of the memorial. I commend the hard work of my colleagues, Senator Gorton and Senator Byrd, for their help in securing a $5 million Federal appropriation in this year's appropriations bill. The $5 million Federal commitment will be matched by $5 million from the Oklahoma State Legislature and $14 million in private donations. 
While the thousands of family members and friends of those killed in the bombing will forever bear scars of having their loved ones taken away, the Oklahoma City National Memorial will revere the memory of the survivors and those lost and venerate the bonds that drew us all closer together as a result.

Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, Members of this Chamber are well aware of the national debate on the question of the Food and Drug Administration's jurisdiction to regulate tobacco and tobacco products. To highlight the scope of this debate, I want to point out that this question is currently under review by the U.S. Court of Appeals. It is also a significant issue of debate between Members of Congress as well as Congress and the administration. I am concerned that the inclusion of this provision may be interpreted by some as an attempt by Congress to indirectly affirm FDA's authority to regulate tobacco. 
It is my understanding that a recent report from the American Law Division of the Congressional Research Service stated that section 404 or any other provision in the FDA reform bill `would not interfere with or lessen the agency's authority to regulate tobacco products.' I notice that a rule-of-construction amendment has been included in the FDA reform bill that is intended to clarify further that section 404 of the bill will not affect any authority which the FDA may have to regulate tobacco. Is this the understanding of the Chairman?

Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, in listening to my colleagues, I heard, `Well, the reason why this amendment is offered is because the Teamsters strike against UPS was a phenomenal success.' I have never commented on that. But I don't know that I could consider success that they have 15,000 fewer workers today after the strike than they had before the strike. 
I know that some people characterize it. But I will tell my colleagues, you can question my integrity or not, that is not the reason I am offering this amendment. I am offering this amendment because I read that taxpayers paid $22 million for it. I don't know who won that strike. With strikes I think basically everybody loses. I think the company loses, and the workers lose. And if you have 15,000 fewer jobs, that is a loss. And certainly the company loses lots of money and lots of customers. So that is a loss. 
But that is not the purpose of my amendment. The purpose of my amendment is that I didn't know that the taxpayers were paying for that election. 
I thought, why did we pay for that election? Well, there was a consent decree order in 1989 that said we will have a couple of elections to deal with, 1991 and 1996. And they agreed in the consent decree to supervise all future Teamsters elections. It is in the consent decree. They said, in 1991, the Teamsters will pay for it. They said, in 1996, the taxpayers will pay for it. They were silent on any subsequent elections. 
I want to make sure that we do not pay for it. I do not think we should have paid for the one in 1996. I did not know about it until after the fact. So if anybody wants to question my motives, I almost could put out--I am not questioning other people's motives. I have not raised the fact the Teamsters put in so much money in these elections, and so on. I have never said people are out here defending this because they received support. I am not going to do it. I am not questioning other people's motives. 
I am a little sensitive to that statement because it was made last week, and I did not respond to it earlier this week and now it is repeated. That is infringing, or very close to infringing on Senate rules. 
We have a right to say how money is appropriated in this body. My colleague from Minnesota said, well, maybe in this institution a consent decree overrides the Constitution. I do not think so. In the Constitution of the United States, article I, section 9 says, `No money shall be drawn from the Treasury but in consequence of appropriations made by law.' 
That is by Congress. Article I of the Constitution says, under congressional powers, Congress has the right to appropriate money. We have the right basically not to appropriate money, and that is what this amendment says. This amendment says we do not want to spend another $22 million. We can supervise the election. Frankly, we have to supervise the election. The consent decree says we will supervise the election. 
What happened in the last election? According to the report that was done by the election officer of the Teamsters' last election, `The violation of the rules described above were not merely'--this is a quote from her report, and I will put it into the record. `The violations of the rules described above were not merely technical but products of schemes to funnel union and outside money into the election and thus change the outcome. These were egregious violations by high level functionaries who believed that winning at all costs was more important than abiding by the rules and the law. Members cannot have confidence in their union or its leaders if they see that their choice of officers has been manipulated by outsiders. The election officer has searched for means of properly remedying the violations while at the same time avoiding the burden on the union and its members inherent in holding a new election. Unfortunately, no such path is apparent.'

<TEXT>
Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I heard the comments of my colleague from Maryland, but he is incorrect. The consent decree that was agreed to in 1989 stated that the Teamsters would pay for the election. I will just read it. `The union defendants further consent to U.S. Department of Labor'--this is from the consent decree, page 16--`supervising any IBT'--that is the Teamsters, International Brotherhood of Teamsters--`elections or special elections to be conducted after 1991 for the office of President, Secretary, Treasurer, Vice President and Trustee.' 
They have agreed to supervision. And the Federal Government supervised the 1991 and 1996 elections. What was unique about the 1996 election, we paid for it as well. We conducted it. We paid $22 million. I hope all my colleagues understand that. We paid $22 million, the Federal taxpayers paid $22 million for the 1996 election. It was the one that was determined to be corrupt. We did not do that in 1991. 
What was the difference? I think people are a lot more willing to cheat maybe if it is somebody else's money. And they did. There was corruption with the taxpayers' money. 
We will still have supervision. My amendment does not prohibit supervision. It does not abrogate the consent decree. The consent decree, frankly, was silent on who would pay for any subsequent elections. I even called the former Attorney General and asked him. No, we did not say anything about that. I read this section. It is not there. 
Now, some people would like to interpret it as, oh, the taxpayers will pay for this forever. If there is corruption in the next election, the taxpayers will pay for it. If there is corruption in the next election, we are going to continue having taxpayers get stiffed. In this case, the Teamsters got hurt. I am talking about members of the Teamsters. Union members got hurt because they had a fraudulent election. They have to have it again. And the taxpayers got hurt. I am trying to say it wasn't the taxpayers' fault there was fraud last time. We should not have taxpayers getting ripped off again. 
What is the cost of this? Twenty-two million dollars. Every other union in the country pays for their own election. Every other union in the country. This is not a group that is not doing well. Senator Kennedy and Senator Wellstone have been bragging how well they did in the contract. I do not know what kind of improvements they got. I did check; I think the average wage is about $27 an hour, wages and benefits. That is pretty good. That is $50,000-some a year. In the last election, the taxpayers paid $22 million; there are 1.4 million Teamsters; a little less than 500,000 voted. That is a cost to the taxpayers of about $45 a vote. That is pretty high. If the Teamsters have to pay for this themselves, I calculate it is about $15 a member. That is about a half-an-hour's pay. But they should have to pay for it. When any other union has an election, when the Teamsters have an election, they pay for it. The taxpayers should not have to pay for this. 
So, Mr. President, this amendment is consistent with the consent decree. We are just trying to make it perfectly clear we are not going to pay for the next one. And for anyone to say, well, wait a minute; we don't have the right to do that, they are not reading the Constitution. The consent decree does not say anything about a future election. Maybe they would like to have the discretion, and if the Teamsters have a good attorney they can convince some judge, well, maybe this will be a continuation and therefore taxpayers should pay for it, but that is not in the consent decree. And frankly that should not happen. 
By passing this amendment--and I am optimistic that we will pass this amendment--we say we are not going to pay for it again. We got ripped off once. We paid $22 million for a fraudulent election. We, being the taxpayers, paid $22 million for a fraudulent election last time. We should not do it again. Frankly, we are not going to do it again. 
Do we have the right to do this? Somebody said the consent decree supersedes law. No way in the world. I will read a memo that came from Deputy U.S. Attorney Jamie Gorelick. This is dealing with the Antideficiency Act, but she said, `You should be particularly mindful of this restriction if you are contemplating entering into any consent decree. Please ensure the terms of the consent decree do not obligate the government to spend funds beyond your office litigation budgets or beyond the current fiscal year.' 
They know that. The CRS did some study on the 1989 consent decree, and this was dated May 18, 1995. `Legislation enacted by Congress limiting or restricting funds for the 1996 election would be Federal law and Government parties would be bound to take appropriate action in reliance of that law.' 
That would be if we had denied funding for the 1996 election. We didn't do that. What this amendment will do is say we are going to deny taxpayers' subsidy to the 1998 election. We can still have supervision. As a matter of fact, there will be supervision. There will be supervision on any subsequent election, but it will not be paid for by the taxpayers. Let the Teamsters pay for it. They are the ones who engaged in this corruption. And if anyone looks at the report of the election observer, she talks about `outside money into this election and thus change the outcome.' She said there `were egregious violations by high level campaign functionaries who believed winning at all costs was more important than abiding by the rules and the law.' 
I do not want to repeat that. If we allowed the opponents of this amendment to prevail, we could have the exact same thing happen again. We could have another election. We could have more corruption, and they would be coming back to say, oh, we want you to pay for it again. 
There is no end to what they say would be the outflow of Government dollars. I do not think it is needed. I do not think it is necessary. We got ripped off once. We should not be ripped off again. And so I urge my colleagues to adopt the Nickles-Jeffords-Gregg amendment.

Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, the amendment that I have before the Senate, cosponsored by myself, Senator Jeffords, and Senator Craig basically would say that the taxpayers would not have to pay for a subsequent Teamsters election. The last one cost $22 million, and only 500,000 people voted. 
My amendment does not prohibit supervision. There can still be supervision. My amendment says that if the President certifies to Congress that the Teamsters don't have the money for the election, taxpayers could pay for it, but the Teamsters would have to pay it back, and pay it back with interest. 
I might mention, in 1991, there was an election that the taxpayers didn't pay for, supervised by the Government, and it was fair, it worked. In 1996, the election was supervised and paid for by the taxpayers, and there was corruption. It was a mistake and we should not repeat that mistake. This would protect taxpayers and, in my opinion, the Teamsters as well.

Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, on behalf of the majority leader, I announce that this morning the Senate will resume consideration of S. 1061, the Labor-HHS appropriations bill. As under the order reached last evening, there will be 30 minutes of debate equally divided on the Nickles amendment, No. 1081, regarding Teamsters elections, to be followed by 30 minutes of debate equally divided on the Gregg amendment, No. 1070, regarding educational testing. 
Following that debate time, at approximately 10 a.m. there will be a series of four stacked rollcall votes, including final passage of the Labor-HHS appropriations bill. 
Following those votes, the Senate will begin consideration of S. 830, the FDA reform bill. Under the previous order, there will be 1 hour of debate under the control of Senator Jeffords, and 1 hour of debate under the control of Senator Kennedy. 
In addition, a cloture motion is expected to be filed on the FDA reform bill today. Also, it is anticipated that the Senate will begin consideration of H.R. 2107, the Interior appropriations bill. 
Subsequently, following the ordered votes, which begin at approximately 10 a.m. this morning, additional votes are expected. 
I wish to thank my colleagues for their attention.

Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I compliment my colleague from Washington, Senator Gorton, for an outstanding amendment. Every once in a while we will vote on an amendment that will make a significant difference in our lives and the lives our families, and this is just such an amendment. This is an amendment that says local school boards, local school districts and parents will be making decisions instead of Washington, DC. 
I remember when we debated welfare reform and I asked my staff: How many Federal welfare programs do we have? I was thinking maybe we had 60 or something. It turned out we had 350-some Federal welfare programs. They were stacked on top of each other and, frankly, people could qualify for any number of programs, multiple programs. 
Then I remember we started talking about education. I asked somebody how many programs do we have and how much money are we spending in education? And my staff sent me back: Well, there's hundreds of programs and we spend almost $100 billion. 
I thought, `Well, I don't really think that's the case. We don't spend that much in the Department of Education. And we don't spend that much--I know we have other education programs in other agencies, but surely that is an exaggeration. Maybe that was something that some right-wing Rush Limbaugh group or somebody made up.' So I asked the question and we did some homework and we got some information from CRS. 
This is a listing of all the Federal education programs. It is a big list. There are 788 Federal education programs. I don't care how bright anyone is, there is no one person who can keep track of all these programs. These are all Federal education programs.

Mr. NICKLES. To outline just a little bit, the Department of Education has 307 education programs and spends a little over $59 billion. The Department of Health and Human Services has 172 Federal education programs, that costs $8.6 billion. The Department of Labor has 21 at a cost of $5.4 billion, and I can go on down the list but we have had it printed in the Record. It is a total of 788 programs; a total cost of almost $97 billion a year. I found that hard to believe, and I served on the Budget Committee for years and thought I knew a little bit about Federal budgeting. But I started looking at these figures, and they are astronomical.

Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, in 1989, Congress enacted legislation that requires that the Social Security Administration provide workers with regular statements about the value of their Social Security benefits. SSA is required to send these forms--known as the Personal Earnings and Benefit Estimate Statements (PEBES)--to any eligible individual who requests one and was mandated to send an annual PEBES to each eligible workers over the age of 59 in 1995. 
In FY 2000, the Secretary will be required to send this form annually to all eligible workers over the age of 25--An estimated 123 million Americans are expected to receive this form in FY 2000. The SSA projects that the cost of administering this law in FY 2000 will be $80 million. 
These forms are specifically designed to help beneficiaries understand the value of their Social Security benefits. While I agree with the stated goal of the PEBES forms, I do not agree that the PEBES form in its current design meets the test of providing that information. In fact, I believe that in its current structure the PEBES form is misleading to beneficiaries. 
Right now, individuals are provided an estimate of their retirement benefit. They are provided a yearly breakdown of their reported earnings, and a yearly breakdown of the taxes he or she paid. What is NOT reflected in this statement is the employer's contribution. My amendment will require the Social Security Administration to include the employer's contribution on the PEBES statement. 
By not including the employer's contribution, the form misleads workers on the actual amount of money being contributed into Social Security on their behalf and distorts the true rate of return on their taxes. 
Most people think that FICA represents 7.65 percent of their wages. Actually, it is twice that when you consider the employer's contribution totaling 15.3 percent--12.4 percent designated Social Security and 2.9 designated to Medicare. 
Mr. President, the employer share of FICA is a labor cost. This is a cost of employing somebody in this country. This is compensation that is not available to go to the employee but instead is contributed on their behalf through FICA taxes. While we refer to this as the employer share, in reality this additional 7.65 percent comes out of the employee's compensation. 
The PEBES is only telling half the story. Omitting the employer's share of FICA is a gross misrepresentation. The worker who looks at his or her statement will falsely assume that their estimated benefit is providing them a much higher rate of return. In fact, the rate of return is much lower because the taxes that a person is paying is actually TWICE what the PEBES form indicates. 
The PEBES form does provide for representation of the self-employed share, however, those workers who are not self-employed are not getting the truth about the performance of their Social Security taxes. 
Mr. President, my amendment is simple. It will require that we are honest to taxpayers about not only what their full benefits will be but that we are also honest on what the full cost of those benefits are. If we are going to take the time and resources to educate workers on their benefits we should ensure that it is done honestly and correctly. 
Frankly, I believe that we would improve the PEBES form even more by tackling some of the issues that Senator Grams has laid out in his legislation Workers should be informed on the real rate of return on their taxes; they should understand how the Social Security program is performing compared to the private market; and finally, when the Social Security Administration projects benefit estimates they should also be required to inform beneficiaries that the trust fund won't be able to pay benefits after 2029. 
I am pleased that this amendment has been accepted by the managers of the bill and I believe it will help improve one of the few tools available to us in educating the public about planning for their retirement.

Mr. NICKLES. Madam President, earlier today the Senate adopted an amendment No. 1109, an amendment that I introduced along with Senator Roth, Senator Moynihan, Senator Grams from Minnesota, and Senator Hagel, that deals with Social Security Administration personal earnings and benefit estimate statements [PEBES]. 
The amendment that we passed requires the Social Security Administration to include the employee contributions as well as employer contributions on the PEBES. Right now, when those 
statements are compiled, they show employee contributions but not employer contributions. Due to the support of the chairman of the Finance Committee and Senator Moynihan, these statements in the future will show not only what the individual contributed but also what the company contributed and what their future anticipated benefits will be. 
I think it is a good amendment. It is a disclosure amendment. A lot of people are not aware of the fact that not only do they contribute 7.65 percent of their payroll for Social Security and Medicare, but their employer matches it, for a total of 15.3 percent of payroll. This personal benefit statement will be sent to every eligible working American from Social Security beginning in fiscal year 2000. Americans will receive this financial disclosure every year, so people will know what they have contributed to Social Security and what their employer has contributed as well. 
I thank my colleagues for supporting this amendment, especially the chairman and ranking member of the Finance Committee and Senator Specter. 
Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.

I want to compliment Senator Brownback for his outstanding statement, and also thank Senator Brownback and Senator Hutchinson for their work to award Mother Teresa the Congressional Gold Medal. Earlier this year, when she spoke to both the House and the Senate, and, frankly, to the country, we had a real honor, a real pleasure, maybe of seeing a real saint in our presence. 
I have had the pleasure of greeting Mother Teresa two or three times in my Senate career: Once in 1985, when she received the Presidential Medal of Freedom, and then also when she addressed the National Prayer Breakfast, I believe it was in 1994.

Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, Senator Brownback used the word `saint.' And I can't recall too many living individuals that I ever referred to as a saint. But I remember during Mother Teresa's life, after meeting her in 1985 and subsequent to her speech at the National Prayer Breakfast, I referred to her as `a living saint.' 
The very fact is that her life touched other lives in letting them know that they are loved by God. Looking at her speeches and at her statements, she truly did make this world a better place. She did love people who were downtrodden. She did love the people that no one else would love. She did reach out to protect all individuals. Her love for the ailing and for the sick is well known. Her love for the unborn is well known. In her speeches at the National Prayer Breakfast, she was talking about abortion and what a terrible cruelty it is. Then she ended up, and concluding said, `Well, send me your children. If you do not want your child, I will take your child.' Again we are talking about a real missionary of love. 
So, Mr. President, it is with sadness that we note Mother Teresa's passing. But we did want to recognize her great contributions to mankind throughout the world. 
And so it is with a sense of sadness that the Senate today will be voting on this after lunch today, but we wanted to recognize the wonderful expression of love that Mother Teresa of Calcutta has had and the impact she has had on our lives, and really the lives of countless people throughout the world. 
I yield the floor.

<TEXT>
Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, the amendment I send to the desk on behalf of myself and Senator Jeffords is an amendment that deals with the potential rerun of the 1996 Teamsters election. I think most of my colleagues are aware the Teamsters election, which was held in 1996, has now been held invalid, at least by the administrator overseeing the election who determined that there was fraud, that there was corruption, and that there needed to be another election. She has now made that petition before the U.S. district court. The court will rule on that. My guess is she will probably order another election. 
The purpose of this is to ensure that taxpayers won't pay for the next election. To give my colleagues a little history of how the U.S. taxpayers paid for the last one, I have heard estimates of around $22 million. I also heard more than $22 million, maybe higher or closer to $28 or $29 million, but the taxpayers paid millions of dollars, $20 million-some for the 1996 Teamsters election. 
Now it seems that the Federal overseer of that election says it was not fair, it was not right, there was corruption, it needs to be held over again. 
The purpose of this amendment is to say that taxpayers will not pay for it again. I might mention, somebody said why would taxpayers pay for it in the first place? Mr. President, 99 percent of all union elections that are held in this country, the U.S. taxpayer does not pay for. There was a 1989 decree with the Teamsters and the Justice Department entered into in 1989 that called for the elections both in 1991 and 1996. The 1991 election, I might mention, had oversight by the Federal Government but was not paid for by the Federal Government. Actually, the Teamsters paid for the 1991 election. 
With Federal Government oversight, no allegations of improprieties or corruption were made. It was a good election. The 1996 election, however, provided for in the decree, provided that the taxpayers would pay for the 1996 election. Now the overseer of that election said, wait a minute, there was fraud, we will have to have another election. 
The purpose of this amendment is, let's not pay for it, let the Teamsters pay for it. Somebody said, well, maybe they do not have the money, it could cost several million. I heard it could cost $10 million, it might cost $20 million. Who knows? I think they will be more frugal if they are paying for it. Certainly, they are capable of paying for it. In the event they do not have the money, our amendment allows for the taxpayers to pay for it, but we have to be paid back. 
Again, I think taxpayers did not get their money's worth out of the 1996 election. If you paid $20 million-some and you find there was rampant corruption, fraud, and abuse to the extent we have to have another election--we should not let that happen again. 
So, that is the purpose of my amendment. I think it is a fair amendment. It is in accord with the 1989 decree ordered in the past. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. 
I ask for the yeas and nays.

Mr. NICKLES. I am just trying to help a little bit. If the Senator will drop those last few words, I might agree to his amendment, because I think our amendment is consistent with the consent decree. But I may be overly interpreting. I don't know exactly what the sentiment is for `or any court orders thereunder.' But it might be hoped by the Teamsters, or something, they could go to court and find some court that would say, yes, the Federal Government should pay for a rerun election. That is not covered. 
I might tell my colleague that I have done a little homework on this. The rerun is not covered by the consent decree. There certainly is no obligation for taxpayers to pay for reruns, which is not consistent with the statement of the Senator from Massachusetts. That, I think, is factual. 
So my point is, if the Senator would delete those last few words `or any court orders thereunder,' I think I could accept his amendment.

So my guess is, I think we will have to at some point move to table Senator Kennedy's amendment, find out where the votes are, and dispose of my amendment. I would hate to have to wait longer and longer. So I would just as soon move ahead with our amendment.

Senator Kennedy came up with a very clever amendment, and I am still trying to figure out what the net impact would be. I still do not know. I have the greatest respect for my colleague. That is one of the reasons I am not sure I want to agree to his amendment. I have a great desire to work with my colleague from Massachusetts, but in the last 2 1/2 hours I still have not been able to determine, if we adopted his second-degree amendment, who would pay for the Teamsters' election. 
Therefore, Mr. President, I think, after consulting with others, that I will debate the Kennedy amendment. At some point I will move to table the Kennedy amendment. Then we can dispose of our amendment and proceed to the amendment of the Senator from Arizona and dispose of the bill.

<TEXT>
Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, for the information of our colleagues, so everyone can understand what the Nickles amendment is and what the Kennedy amendment is--and we will be voting on a motion to table the Kennedy amendment and, hopefully, a motion on the underlying Nickles-Jeffords amendment. 
The Nickles-Jeffords amendment is this: Taxpayers should not have to pay for the Teamsters' election twice. 
Mr. President, in 1989, the consent decree said that there will be an election in 1991 and said that the Teamsters would pay for it. They did. They had a successful election. It had oversight and management by the Government, but it was paid for by the Teamsters. It was deemed to be a good election. 
The 1996 election had oversight and management by the Federal Government, and it was also paid for by the Federal Government. The overseer of the election, though, said there was some fraud, said there was some corruption, and said in her opinion we needed to have a new election. She has now petitioned a judge, and the judge will be ordering a new election. 
My point being, it is not the taxpayers' fault that there was fraud. That came from the Teamsters. I do not have any qualm on who is elected or who is not elected. That is not my issue. Somebody, I think, said, `You're trying to influence an election.' Far from it. That is not my decision. My decision is to protect taxpayers. Taxpayers should not have to pay for it again. 
The estimates of the cost are $22 million. I heard subsequent to that that it will be well over $22 million. I heard estimates up to $28 million, $30 million. My point is, we should not have to pay for it again. We paid for it once. It was not U.S. taxpayers that had the corruption. That happened to come from within the union. They hired some consultants, and they funneled money to various campaigns. We should not have to pay for that. That is not the taxpayers' fault. 
So what would our amendment do? Our amendment basically says you can have a rerun election and, if the Teamsters do not have the money, the Federal Government can pay for it; just that the Federal Government has to be paid back. 
So to me it is eminently fair. It does not have any influence, saying, `This group is favored over another group.' It does not say anything in the wording--my colleague from Massachusetts said this has something to do with the UPS strike. That is totally hogwash. There was an abuse in dealing with the UPS strike. That was the fact that the overseer knew there was corruption in the election, knew it during the strike, but did not let the rest of the country know. This is one of the most important strikes, but that does not have anything to do with it. 
My point being, if there is another election, let the Teamsters pay for it. These happen to be individuals who make good money. Almost all elections in the country are paid for, if you are talking about union elections, are paid for by the union. And they should be paid for by the union. This is not that big a deal. There are 1.4 million members. I think a little less than 500,000 people voted in the last election. I think they can pay for it. The average payroll of the Teamsters can well afford this, so they should pay for it. If they do not have the money, the taxpayers can pay for it, and the taxpayers can be paid back with interest. It is only fair. 
Is it consistent with the consent decree of 1989? Yes, it is. The consent decree of 1989 said that the Teamsters would pay for the 1991 election and that the taxpayers would pay for the 1996 election. It did not say taxpayers pay for a 1996 rerun if there is corruption in the election. 
Some people would like--and I believe Senator Kennedy's position would be: Well, let's leave that up to a judge. We will let a judge decide whether taxpayers have to pay for it or not. The consent decree was silent. It didn't say who would have to pay for a rerun if there's corruption in the election. 
I want to eliminate the question mark. I want to make sure that taxpayers do not pay for it. It is that simple. Why leave it to the determination of a judge? I do not think the judge has --frankly, if the judge reads the consent decree, there is nothing in the consent decree that would indicate taxpayers should pay for a 1996 rerun. But why leave it ambiguous? Let us just say, wait a minute, if we are going to have a rerun, fine, let the Teamsters pay for it, and, if necessary, if they do not have the money, the U.S. taxpayers pay for it, but they have to be repaid. 
I think our amendment is eminently fair. I wish my colleague from Massachusetts had not second-degreed it. It is confusing. His amendment looks innocuous, but we do not want to turn it over to the courts. Therefore, at the appropriate time, after a couple of our colleagues have spoken on the amendment, I will move to table the Kennedy amendment.

Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I heard the comments of my colleague from Alaska, but basically what he is saying is we should not tell the Department of Labor how to spend money. In this appropriations bill we appropriate money for the Department of Labor. In this case they appropriated about $22 million--admittedly it came from the Department of Labor and the Department of Justice--to conduct this last election. And they did a pretty crummy job. We paid millions of dollars and we ended up with a corrupt election. 
I do not want that to happen again. We talk about adherence to the consent decree that was agreed to in 1989. I think my original amendment is in adherence to the 1989 consent decree, because it said that the Teamsters will pay for the 1991 election. They paid for it. And guess what. There was no complaint that it was a corrupt election. They paid for it themselves. You know what. People are a lot more frugal with their own money. They are less likely to steal from their own members. They are less likely to be corrupt maybe with their own members' money than they would be with taxpayer money. 
So we had a 1991 election. Mr. Carey won. Fine. And I don't know that anybody--there was an overseer in the 1991 election. They did not allege fraud in that. So the 1991 election was done by the Teamsters. They paid for it. They should have paid for it. They had a good election. No one said a thing. The 1996 election the taxpayers paid for. 
I will admit I did not know we paid for it until I read about it. And when did we read about it? Well, the overseer of the election, she announced during, or after the UPS strike--and that is the only thing UPS has to do with this--she waited until after the UPS strike to announce that there was fraud and that her recommendation would be that we need a new election. Mr. Carey only won by a few thousand votes. She said that maybe there were hundreds of thousands of dollars that were funneled in his direction and so she thought a new election was warranted. 
Fine. Let there be a new election. I am just saying in the new election taxpayers should not pay for it. We did not pay for the one in 1991. It was a clean election. We paid for the one in 1996 and there was corruption. A lot of money was moved around. Let's make sure, if we have an election in 1998, it is not a corrupt election. 
That is the purpose. This bill funds the Department of Labor for 1998. Let's make sure that taxpayer money is not used for this purpose. 
Somebody says, well, is this in compliance with the consent decree. I will tell you the consent decree is silent on a rerun election. It does not say it. I read the consent decree two or three times. It does not say anything about a rerun. So maybe a judge would determine, well, maybe taxpayers should pay for it. Maybe a judge would not. But wait a minute. Congress is supposed to appropriate money, and we have opinions. If somebody says, well, we are violating, we are stamping out the consent decree, hogwash. The consent decree does not say it. 
I did not request this, but there is a Congressional Research Service study dated May 1995, what would happen if Congress--does Congress have the right to withhold the money? The answer is yes. I will read you the quote from CRS. I will ask unanimous consent to put the entire study into the Record. But it says: 
Legislation enacted by Congress limiting or restricting the funds for the 1996 election would be a Federal law, and the Government parties would be bound to take appropriate action in reliance on that law. 
What are the consequences to the Congress of not appropriating all the funds necessary to supervise the 1996 IBT elections? 
There would appear to be no consequences to the Congress. The consent decree does not appear to obligate the Government to supervise the 1996 elections, either directly or indirectly. Rather, the decree embodies the consent of the union defendants to governmental supervision. 
We had governmental supervision in 1991. We will in 1998. What I am saying is let's just not pay for the election. This is not a destitute group of individuals. These are people who do quite well. Great. 
I read something; they average $27 an hour, about $50,000 a year. Fine. Why is the Federal Government paying for the election? We did not pay for the other election. We did not pay for the 1991 election. Why would we pay for a rerun of the election? 
All I am trying to do is protect taxpayers' money. And my colleague is suggesting, well, maybe somebody is upset about the UPS settlement. That has nothing to do with it. I am offended by that allegation. That is totally ridiculous. All I am trying to do is protect taxpayers. 
They had their strike. They had their settlement. And some people are running around saying, `great victory,' and so on. So be it. I am just saying you are not entitled to another $22 million of taxpayers' money. If the Teamsters pay for it--if it cost the Teamsters maybe less than half an hour to pay for their own election, they should pay for it. 
I even went so far in the amendment to try to be fair. Some people said make sure you put in language that no Federal funds be used to conduct the election. You could use it to oversee the election, to supervise the election. We do that in Third World countries. We do that in new democracies, so maybe we would spend a little money to oversee the election. 
I think that is fine, to have observers to try to monitor the election, to see that we would eliminate some of the corruption, but we had corruption when we had Federal funding because people took some of the Federal money and abused it. I am trying to make sure that does not happen again. 
Do we have the constitutional right to do it? Absolutely. CRS said we do. The consent decree is silent on a rerun. Certainly we can do that. And my colleague from Alaska says the judge may not even agree. We had the overseer, who made $300,000 or $400,000 monitoring this election, find out it is corrupt, withholds that information until after the UPS strike and then says, oh, yeah, we are going to have a new election. I 
didn't want to tell anybody during the strike because it might have influenced the strike one way or another. Oh, yes, but we need a new election. 
I am saying fine. If they need a new election, I agree. If that's her recommendation, fine. I am saying taxpayers shouldn't pay for it. Very plain and simple. We can monitor it. We can try to make sure it is not corrupt. But we should not pay for it. It's that simple. We didn't pay for the 1991 election. They had a good election. Certainly we can allow an election in 1998, if there is to be an election. If there isn't going to be an election, fine. My amendment wouldn't cost the taxpayers. I am trying to save the taxpayers money. So this amendment wouldn't cost anything. 
The very thought of my colleague who said maybe the administration would veto it, wait a minute. You have an appropriations bill that is actually hundreds of billions of dollars. They are going to veto this bill because they want to protect the Teamsters from what? Paying for their own election. Give me a break. You have to be kidding. How special interest could this group be? I know I saw the Vice President with the Teamsters on Labor Day, with thumbs up, and so on. But surely they would not veto a bill that says this group, which is pretty well compensated at an average--I guess truckers are making something like, I don't know, $27 an hour, wages and benefits--surely they say taxpayers that make a lot less than that should not be paying for their election when the consent decree does not say that. The consent decree is silent, frankly, on election reruns. I can't imagine that the administration would recommend vetoing a bill over something that special interest. 
So, Mr. President, I think we have had adequate debate. I would just urge my colleagues to vote to table the Kennedy amendment, and I move to table the Kennedy amendment.

Mr. NICKLES. I rise in support of the amendment offered by my colleague from Idaho. 
Mr. President, let me just clarify again, some of our colleagues were not aware of the taxpayers' support for the last election. I told a couple colleagues--they said, `How much did we spend?' We spent $22 million; some people said more. The union has 1.4 million members. A little less than 500,000 voted. And $22 million is a lot of money. And a lot of money was wasted or maybe abused. It was abused, frankly, because it was taxpayers' money. That did not happen when it was their own union money. I mention, every other union in the country uses their own money for their own elections, as they should. 
So, again, I urge my colleagues to adopt this amendment. This is not an unfair amendment. This even says that we can still use taxpayers' money. If for some reason the Teamsters do not have the money, they can borrow money from the Federal Government. They just have to pay it back. It happens to be, in my opinion, consistent with the consent decree because the consent decree is silent. The word `rerun election' is not mentioned in the 1989 decree. 
So what we are trying to say is, in future elections they should pay for it. We can still have Federal Government monitors. We can still have some oversight to try to make sure it is not abused, as that last election was. Taxpayers were abused as well as Teamsters last time. 
So I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. 
Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the amendment.

Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, one final comment. 
We talk about this money, and people say, `Big deal.' We are talking about $22 million. The Federal subsidy for Presidential campaigns is what? $71 million for a general election. That is the amount of money that Senator Dole received; that is the amount that Clinton-Gore received from the taxpayers. This is one-third as much. That amount of money was for the entire country. We are talking about 1.4 million people, and only 500,000 or less voted last time. 
Should taxpayers be liable for $22 million, or more? I do not think so. So this amendment tries to protect taxpayers. That is all it does. It tries to be fair to Teamsters and does not get involved in who should win in any way, shape, or form. It does not have anything to do with the UPS strike whatsoever. 
The only involvement of the UPS strike was the fact that they found out there was a corrupt election, and that information was withheld until after the strike was over. I am just saying, let us just make sure that taxpayers do not get stuck again. We got stuck in 1996. It was a corrupt election. Let us not let it happen again for future elections. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. NICKLES. I am happy to tell my colleague that in reviewing the consent agreement we did not undo anything. The consent decree does not say anything about a rerun election. It says that the Teamsters will pay for the 1991 election and it says taxpayers will pay for the 1996 election. It does not say anything about who will pay for a subsequent election. We are trying to clarify that. 
We had 56 votes who say the taxpayers should not, that the Teamsters should. I think that is consistent with the consent decree. 
I might mention, the CRS just studied this, and whose legal analysis I will refer to again, says the Congress has the right to do this, period.

Mr. NICKLES. Several comments were made that we are vitiating the consent decree. Totally false. I will tell my colleagues, you can read the consent decree, it does not say anything about a rerun election. The consent decree did say that the Teamsters would pay for the 1991 election and taxpayers would pay for the 1996 election. 
The Teamsters came out very well. They got a nice gift, $22 million, maybe more, which is over about $45, maybe $50 per person as the cost to the taxpayers of this vote. That is pretty high. Some of us do not think we should do it again. 
Maybe I was asleep at the switch in 1989. It happened. Nobody objected. And in 1991, since the Teamsters paid for it, it never came up. I was not aware of it until after the 1996 election and we found the abuse. It is an abuse on the Teamsters and on the taxpayers and should not be repeated. That is the reason we have the amendment before the Senate. 
We do not vitiate the consent decree. We say in the future, judge, we know the consent decree is silent. It does not say who should pay for it. 
Now, frankly, if you read the Constitution it says Congress shall have the power to appropriate money. It does not say `an unelected judge.' It does not say a judge, where a consent decree is silent, has the power to go in and mandate something, like mandating U.S. taxpayer funds. Some of us think elected officials should make that decision, not unelected judges. 
We are stating that in the future if there is another election, let the Teamsters pay. This is not a group of individuals that cannot afford it.

Let me correct you. What I said, the way I hope it would be done is the way it was done in 1991. You had Federal supervision, you had Federal observers, you had Federal monitors, but you did not have taxpayers paying $22 million for the election in 1991, and you had, in 1991, an election that had Federal observers stating that they thought this was a fair, clean election. That is what I want. I want the Teamsters to have a fair, clean election and I do not want the taxpayers to take another ride for $22 million. 
If we followed the thought that you and Senator Kennedy have, you could have another corrupt election, taxpayers would be out another $20 or $30 million, an observer could receive another $400,000 for saying, `Oops, it was corrupt again,' and we could do it again and again and again. 
Taxpayers have been taken for a ride once, we should not be taken for a ride again.

Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, since I have the floor I will make a comment. 
I am not undermining that because the consent decree touched two elections, for my colleagues' information. It touched the 1991 election and touched the 1996 election, and it did both elections differently. I hope my colleague will realize that, and if he reads the consent decree he will see that is the fact. 
It said in 1991 the Teamsters paid for the election with some Federal supervision. In 1996 it said we will have Federal supervision and taxpayers pay for it. It does not say anything about a rerun. I am just saying on the rerun we should not pay for the election. We can still have supervision but we should not pay for it. That simple.

What our amendment would do would be to clarify, `Judge, you can make your order, but Uncle Sam or the taxpayers are not going to pay for the next election.'

<DOCNO>105-nickles-ok-34-19970904</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
Mr. NICKLES. I do not think so for this reason: One, because I think the Congress of the United States was elected to appropriate the money, not an unelected judge in New York; and, two, this is timely because this is an appropriations bill for 1998. If the election is ordered, it will be for 1998. 
I think, instead of allowing the Departments of Labor and Justice and this administration, who has very close ties with this particular union and might like to give them a $22 million gift--I don't think we should do that. So in this bill we are appropriating for next year, I think we should make it very clear that the taxpayers got the shaft and so did the Teamsters out of this last $22 million, and it should not happen again. 
We clearly have the constitutional prerogative and right, as stated by CRS and the Constitution, to control Federal funds. I think we should make it very clear that in any subsequent election the Teamsters should pay for their own election. Every other union in the country pays for their own elections. They should do so. 
Incidentally, when you look at the 1991 election, which they paid for, it was a good election. Then look at the election where the taxpayers put in $22 million; it was a corrupt election. That should tell you something. Federal funds don't automatically mean you are going to have clean elections. We can still have oversight. We have oversight in Third World countries where our Government is involved in bringing people in, whether it's President Carter or others, to help oversee and make sure elections are clean and upright. 
Don't get me wrong. The Mafia has been very involved in the Teamsters, and they have been for decades. I want them to be out. I want the union to be clean. I want people to be able to vote and elect their representatives. It is kind of embarrassing, despite all this money, when you have a union of 1.4 million people and only 400-some-odd-thousand voted in the last election. I don't think the U.S. taxpayers should have to take the hit for paying for it to the tune of $22 million.

I will read a statement that came from the Department of Justice, on page 2: `Because of the deep entrenchment of La Cosa Nostra in the Teamsters electoral process, the consent decree gave the Government and the IBT the option to have the IBT election supervised by a court-appointed officer.' 
It is because of the mob influence that has been with this union for a long time. I want it to be out. Hopefully, it is out. Obviously, there was still some corruption in the last election, which had a lot of taxpayer funding. The fact that the taxpayers had funds in it didn't clean it up. That is my point.

The overseer costs almost $400,000 for that one position. That is a lot of money. I don't have too many constituents that make that kind of money--$175 an hour. We had a lot of supervision and still had a corrupt election. We can still have supervision, but we should not pay for it. We had a clean election in 1991.

We can do it like we did it in 1991.

Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I rise in support of the amendment of the Senator from Indiana [Mr. Coats] to prohibit the use of Federal money to conduct research using fetal tissue on Parkinson's disease, fetal tissue that is produced from elective abortion. The Coats amendment exempts spontaneous abortions, exempts ectopic pregnancies. But really the thrust of his amendment is that we do not want to turn abortion clinics into mills producing tissue that is used for research. 
I support his amendment. I do think it is immoral to use fetal tissue from elective abortions for medical research. I think occasionally we have to make moral statements. Do we really want to allow abortion clinics to harvest material to be used for research in whatever disease? In this case it is Parkinson's disease. Do we really want that to happen in this country? 
We had a prohibition on it for years. It was not done for years. Now some people think that maybe it would be a good idea. Tissue can be harvested, can be used if the abortion is spontaneous, but not in the case of elective abortions. Do we want to have a situation where an individual goes in and kills a human being, although not yet born, maybe up into the eighth month of pregnancy, kill that unborn human being and use that human being's cells for medical research? I do not think so, and I do not think we should fund it. 
The Senator from Indiana should be complimented for his amendment. I wish that this amendment was not necessary. I heard yesterday that NIH or someone has alluded to the fact that NIH, had no objections to the amendment. 
So I am maybe a little bit surprised that others are opposing this amendment as aggressively as they are. I urge my colleagues to support the Coats amendment. I think it is a good amendment. I regret that it is needed, but it is needed. I think it is important. I do not think we as a country want to have a national policy allowing abortion mills to kill unborn children and use their body parts for medical research. That is a serious issue. That is what we are voting on. So I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of the Coats amendment. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, today, the Senate is considering S. 871, the Oklahoma City National Memorial Act of 1997. This important legislation will establish the Oklahoma City National Memorial as a unit of the National Park Service and create the Oklahoma City Memorial Trust. The memorial will commemorate the national tragedy ingrained in all of our minds that occurred in downtown Oklahoma City at 9:02 a.m. on April 19, 1995, in which 168 Americans lost their lives and countless thousands more lost family members and friends. 
The Oklahoma City National Memorial will serve as a monument to those whose lives were taken and others who will bear the physical and mental scars for the rest of their days. The memorial will stand as a symbol to the hope, generosity, and courage shown by Oklahomans and fellow Americans across the country following the Oklahoma City bombing. This will be a place of remembrance, peace, spirituality, comfort, and learning. 
 Under this legislation, the National Park Service Memorial site will encompass the footprint of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building, 5th Street between Robinson and Harvey, the site of the Water Resources Building, and the Journal Record Building. An international competition was held to determine the design of the Oklahoma City National Memorial, and the winning design was announced on Tuesday, July 1. I commend the Oklahoma City Memorial Foundation for an excellent selection of the winning design. 
In addition to designating the memorial site as a unit of the National Park Service, this bill also establishes a wholly owned government corporation to be known as the Oklahoma City National Memorial Trust. The trust, consisting of a chairman and an eight-member board, will be charged with administering the operation, maintenance, management, and interpretation of the memorial site. 
Further, the legislation authorizes a one-time $5 million Federal donation for construction and maintenance of the memorial. The Federal appropriation will be matched by $5 million from the Oklahoma State Legislature and $14 million in private donations. 
While the thousands of family members and friends of those killed in the bombing will forever bear scars of having their loved ones taken away, the Oklahoma City National Memorial will revere the memory of the survivors and those lost, and venerate the bonds that drew us all closer together as a result.

Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee has worked closely with me on a provision in this bill to clarify the application of section 168(j) of the Internal Revenue Code to Indian lands in Oklahoma. 
Section 168(j) was enacted in 1993 to provide accelerated depreciation for property placed in service on Indian reservations. Since Oklahoma has no formal reservations, the House of Representatives included a provision in their tax bill to clarify that lands in Oklahoma within the jurisdictional area of an Oklahoma Indian tribe and eligible for trust-land status would qualify for section 168(j). 
As the chairman knows, the Senate receded to the House provision in conference. However, since the House leaves the interpretation of the provisions to the U.S. Department of the Interior, I believe it is essential that we clarify congressional intent. 
There needs to be a `bright-line' test for determining which Oklahoma lands qualify for section 168(j) in order to treat Oklahoma fairly compared to other States and to avoid costly litigation. The Department of the Interior has indicated that `lands in Oklahoma within the jurisdictional area of an Oklahoma Indian tribe' would be defined as lands within boundaries of the last treaties with the Oklahoma tribes. This definition narrows the land area compared with current law by eliminating the unassigned lands. 
Because I believe it is important that we clarify this matter, does the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee concur with my explanation?

Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, first, I wish to compliment and congratulate the chairman of the Finance Committee, Senator Roth, and his counterpart, Senator Moynihan, for the bipartisan way in which they have worked to put this bill together. Also, I wish to compliment the majority leader of the Senate, Senator Lott, and Speaker of the House, Speaker Gingrich, because, frankly, they set up the design to make this happen. They said let's get something passed. Let's pass a law. Let's reach out. Let's have Democrat support. Let's not jut pass a Republican package. 
I will tell you, I think the bill we passed 2 years ago was a lot better. It had a net tax cut of $245 billion. This bill has a tax cut of $95 billion. The difference is this is going to become law. That is important. The tax bill we passed a couple of years ago had a tax credit of $500 per child. We have it in this bill. And so if a family of median income has three kids, that's $1,500 that they get to spend, not Washington, DC. It is their money. They earned it. They should be able to keep it. That is the whole premise of this package. 
We have education relief. I hear some of my colleagues who are opposing this say, well, it does too much for the wealthy. It's really slanted toward the upper income. That is totally false; 82 percent of the package goes to education and the family tax credit. Those are limited to middle income. Families with over $100,000 or over $110,000 do not qualify. So this is targeted towards families, middle-income families. 
I think it is a good package. It also has IRA's, and I compliment Chairman Roth because he has been so steadfast in pushing for individual retirement accounts for spouses. Now we have millions of nonworking spouses that will be able to invest in an IRA before taxes. I think that is a very positive provision. We have educational IRA's, again because of Chairman Roth. We have relief from the so-called death tax. We will increase the exemption from $600,000 to $1 million. It takes 10 years. So I encourage people not to pass away if they are in that range. They need to wait a few years. But we also increased the exemption for family businesses, farms and ranches. And I will tell my colleagues, it is extremely popular, very much needed. If you have a family farm, business or ranch and you happen to pass away and you have a taxable estate of $1 million. You are in a taxable rate of 39 percent. And I don't think Government is entitled to take 39 percent of that property. And so again I think this is long overdue. 
We have other relief in this bill to encourage savings, to encourage investment. We reduced the capital gains tax 20 percent. Every time we reduced capital gains we have had more savings. 
And so again, I think this is a positive bill. It will encourage jobs; it will encourage savings. It will leave families to keep more of their own money in their pocketbooks. 
I compliment again the Speaker and I compliment the leader, Senator Roth, and Senator Moynihan, those who worked so tirelessly to make this happen. The good news is this will become law. We will do what we said we were going to do. We said we were going to give American families tax relief. We said we were going to pass incentives to create more jobs. We have done that in this bill. I urge my colleagues to vote for it. I am glad to see this will become law soon. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I am happy to join as a cosponsor to S. 625, the Auto Choice Reform Act of 1997. This bill enjoys wide bipartisan support for the choice that it offers every American when choosing car insurance. Under this bill, families and individuals will be able to exchange the right to bring certain lawsuits for a substantial savings on their automobile insurance. This bill will allow consumers the right to purchase a low-cost policy that will cover medical bills and lost wages but not pain and suffering damage claims. Those policies will also give the purchasers immunity from pain and suffering claims against them. The current State liability systems will remain intact as a choice for individuals who would prefer the freedom to sue and be sued for pain and suffering damages. 
American taxpayers stand to save a total of $45 billion nationwide. This savings would go directly in the pocket of every insured person at no cost to the taxpayers. The Joint Economic Committee has projected that the auto choice option will save Oklahomans $420 million in automobile insurance premiums and will put $186 back into the accounts of every person with a car. This is the equivalent of an instant tax cut for every insured person. 
The New York Times stated that with this bill: `Everyone would win--except the lawyers' that live off of the current liability system. In fact, trial lawyers take in an estimated $17 billion a year from auto accident cases. USA Today reported that 35 cents of every auto premium dollar goes to lawyers. 
This bill has been labeled a `model of federalism.' Each State has the right to opt out of auto choice if the State insurance commissioner finds that residents fail to receive at least a 30 percent reduction in bodily injury premiums. The State legislature retains the right to simply pass a law against this option and keep its current auto liability system. 
There is mounting evidence that the current auto liability insurance system has become prey to rampant fraud and abuse, which is constantly fed by inflated pain and suffering claims. FBI Director Louis Freeh estimated that the average household pays an additional $200 in unnecessary premiums just to cover these fraudulent schemes. This hits low income families particularly hard since about one-third of a family's disposable income is consumed by car insurance costs. Auto choice will put that money back into the pockets of taxpayers to help pay for needed expenses, providing long-overdue relief to all who choose this option. 
I am happy to cosponsor this bill and hope that every American with car insurance will be given the opportunity to make this choice to provide long over due relief to all who choose this option. It is time for all drivers to begin to enjoy lower auto premiums and to allow government to spend its resources outside of the courtroom.

Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, the great success of our Nation is rooted in the labors of millions of Americans who work every day to make America a better place. I'd like to take a moment to recognize one such American--a fellow Oklahoman, Denise Bode, who has dedicated most of her adult life to making our Nation a better place through her work in the public and private sector. Soon she will begin a new chapter of service to the people of Oklahoma. For this reason, I am very proud to take this opportunity to recognize her contributions over the past several years. 
Denise Bode became involved in Government right after she graduated from the University of Oklahoma, serving as an adviser to my former Senate colleague David Boren who was the Governor of Oklahoma. When David Boren was elected to the Senate, Denise became a member of his U.S. Senate staff and developed an expertise in energy and tax policies. Even though she was working full time, she somehow found time to take courses at night and earn both a law degree and a masters of law in taxation, and devote time to her son Sean as well as be a helpmate to her husband John Bode, who was an Assistant Secretary of Agriculture in the Reagan Administration. 
For the past 6 years she has served as president of the Independent Petroleum Association of America, an organization founded in 1929 in Oklahoma and which today is the Nation's largest membership association representing America's oil and natural gas producers. She was the first and so far the only woman to head a major energy trade association. 
All of us who have worked with Denise over the years in Washington, regardless of party affiliation, whether in the public or private sector, know her to be a tireless advocate for Oklahoma and always looking out for the best interest of our Nation. She is the type of person who will fight tirelessly for what she believes in. In the process, she has made a difference. 
She returns to Oklahoma next month to serve, at the request of Governor Frank Keating, on the Oklahoma Corporation Commission, which oversees both the interest of the consumers in the State and key industries. Ask Denise why she's going back to her native State and she'll say it's because she wants to make a difference; she wants to make Oklahoma an even better place. 
We in Washington often talk about devolution, giving more power and responsibility to the States. I certainly believe that is the proper course of action. Knowing that Denise and other extremely capable people are leading the way in the States gives me added confidence in this policy. And once again, Denise is going where her beliefs lead her. 
I wish her well in this endeavor and feel very confident that she will give to this new position the same dedication and commitment she's given throughout her years of public service.

Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, from 1984 through 1993, language was included as part of the Treasury/Postal Service appropriations bills which prohibited taxpayer money from going to fund abortions through Federal employee health benefits plans. In 1993, President Clinton pushed a change in that policy through Congress. For 2 years, people who were unalterably opposed to abortion were forced to pay for an estimated 17,000 abortions each year for any reason. In 1995, Congress restored the policy of restricting abortion funding and has continued to maintain that policy. The narrow question before us today is whether Americans who stand in defense of life should be forced to pay for its destruction with their taxes. I do not believe they should and thus strongly support my colleague from Ohio's amendment. 
Whether they choose to call themselves pro-choice or pro-life, the American people overwhelmingly reject public financing of abortion. A CBS/New York Times poll conducted in April 1993, about health care reform issues asked adults what should be included in a basic, Government-subsidized health care plan. Only 23 percent thought abortion should be covered. Some 72 percent said abortion should not be included a benefit in a Government-sponsored health plan.

Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, before this body passes the Treasury and general government appropriation bill for fiscal year 1998, I would like to raise an important issue concerning how the Government develops policies and regulations. The issue is the public's right to have access to the data that is produced from Government funded studies and used to support regulatory rulemakings. As you may know, the Federal Government does not have a standardized process for making research data available for independent review. Often the public is forced to comply with costly regulations without the assurance that the data underlying the rules has been made available for independent scientific evaluation. If the Government is going to force the public to comply with its rules, the public must have confidence that the rules are based on sound science. Similarly, if the Government is going to provide funding for research, the public should be able to access the data that is produced from such research. Unfortunately, the Government does not have a disclosure policy on research data. I believe this undermines the scientific basis of our rulemaking and erodes the public's confidence in the Government's regulatory development process. I would like to ask my colleague from Colorado, the chairman of the Treasury and General Government Appropriations Subcommittee, if he would be willing to work with me to correct this problem.

Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I wish to speak in favor of the amendment of Senator Smith of Oregon, which would try to protect religious liberty in Russia. I want to compliment my colleague from Oregon for this amendment. In my opinion, it is probably one of the most important amendments we will debate, certainly on this bill--maybe this Congress. 
Unfortunately, and I guess most of my colleagues are aware of this fact, the Russian Duma overwhelmingly voted to place restrictions on religious freedom in Russia, freedoms that were both won after the collapse of communism and guaranteed by the 1993 Russian Constitution. The overwhelming vote by the Duma is a tremendous step backward for Russia and for its people. 
The legislation approved by the Duma would place severe restrictions on religions not recognized by the government in 1982, a time when the Soviet Government was in power, a time characterized by religious persecution and official atheism. In 1982, as I understand it, the only four religions recognized by the Russian Government were the Russian Orthodox church, Judaism, Islam, and Buddhism. 
As I understand this legislation, it would deny religions that entered Russia after 1982 the right to rent or own property, the right to employ religious workers, the right to produce religious literature, maintain a bank account, or conduct charitable and educational activities. According to an article that appeared in the June 24 edition of the Washington Post, it would sharply restrict the activities of foreign missionaries in Russia. 
I hope my colleagues are aware of this. I was not aware of it until my colleague from Oregon mentioned it to me. I cannot believe that the Duma would pass something by such an overwhelming vote that would deny religious opportunities to the Russian people. Maybe one of the most important of all liberties is the right to worship as one would choose. It is guaranteed by the 1993 Russian Constitution. Yet they would pass legislation basically grandfathering four established religions, but outlawing other religions, such as the Mormon church, the Roman Catholic Church, and untold other numbers of minority religions in Russia. 
The Reverend Gleb Yakunin, an orthodox priest, said in a news report carried by the June 24 edition of the London Times, that the bill was `openly discriminatory' and `The bill is effectively aimed at reinstating Soviet religious policy.' 
I believe the reverend's statement is true. I believe putting restrictions on the religions that have recently entered Russia will have the same effect of not allowing many people to practice their religions. If religions are unable to carry out charitable activities, how can members of various churches practice their religion? 
Christian missionaries who are following the admonition of Christ would not be allowed to do so in Russia. Many remember when Billy Graham went to Russia several years ago. He had an overwhelming reception. Would foreign missionaries not be allowed? Would people that gather be allowed to reproduce materials? I think the reproduction of materials would be banned under the bill that was passed by the Duma. Hopefully, Mr. Yeltsin will not sign this bill. I think it is extremely important he not sign this bill. 
According to Lawrence Uzzell, Moscow representative of the Keston Institute, which studies religious life in Russia and Eastern Europe, of the 102 Catholic priests and 112 nuns serving in Russia, all but a handful are foreigners. In fact, Mr. Uzzell reports that a Catholic priest in Belgorod was recently told he could not celebrate mass there because his parish is a foreign religious organization. 
I think this report confirms what I suspected, that this bill passed by the Duma would not only put restrictions on these religions, but have the effect of denying the opportunity to many to practice their religion. 
So I want to thank my colleague from Oregon for his amendment. Again, it may be one of the most important amendments. 
What is the effect? It says no money under this bill, the foreign operations bill, will go to Russia if President Yeltsin signs this bill into law or if it becomes law, or if he issues an executive order that will ban religious freedom as guaranteed under the Russian Constitution. 
I think it is a very appropriate amendment. Some people will argue this is too heavy of a hammer. I think we need to get their attention. What they are doing by outlawing many religions, basically most Christian religions and organizations, banning those, outlawing those from Russia, I think, would be a terrible, terrible thing to happen to the Russian people. They should not be forced into any religion. We should certainly encourage religious choice and opportunity for all the Russian people. 
Some will say, what is the effect of this amendment? This amendment says no economic assistance will be going to Russia if the President signs this bill or if he issues an executive order which will ban religious freedom in Russia. How much economic assistance does Russia receive? I think last year it was $90-some million, and the President requested $195 million in this bill. It is not earmarked, so we don't have the specific amount. Would this tie the President's hands? This would give real leverage to the administration to tell Russia, this should not become law. 
We need to respect individual religious liberty in Russia and not allow--and certainly not encourage--religious liberty to be trampled. I believe we should use what economic forces we have to ensure this doesn't happen. We don't have to give this economic assistance to Russia. We haven't done it for years. We just started a couple of years ago. Many of the programs that we are funding in the foreign ops bill are worthy programs, where we encourage democracy, encourage free enterprise. That is very positive. But we don't have to do it. 
Maybe we should tell them if they are going to pass this kind of bill, we are not going to do it. If they are going to pass a bill in Russia to deny Baptists the opportunity to distribute materials or to have employees in Russia, then maybe we should not be giving them economic assistance. Maybe we need to use a heavy hammer to get their attention that this is very serious. 
One of the most important freedoms we have, protected by our first amendment, is religious freedom. It is also protected in the Russian Constitution. We should encourage the Russian Government to protect religious freedom, not take it away. So, yes, this is an amendment that has a heavy hammer. It says we are not going to give economic assistance. 
I noticed a memo from the administration in opposition to this amendment, which says our assistance money is used to reduce the number of nuclear weapons and improve security over nuclear materials in Russia. We are not touching that. That is covered by the DOD bill. I encouraged the Senator from Oregon to consider putting it on that bill because I wanted to get their attention early. President Yeltsin hasn't signed this bill--our friend, President Clinton's friend, George Bush's friend. He hasn't signed the bill yet. We want to get his attention before it is too late. This is the proper bill. So it doesn't have anything to do with Nunn-Lugar money, or national defense. It does have some money in there for economic assistance. 
As I mentioned, the President's request is about $190 million. We probably won't fully fund it. But we don't have to fund it at all if they are going to pass a bill denying religious freedom and opportunity for the Russian people. 
So I compliment my colleague from Oregon for an outstanding amendment. I hope we will have an overwhelming vote, maybe 100 to 0, in spite of what the memo says. Let us have a 100 to 0 vote to show that we believe very strongly that religious freedom is very important and we are willing to put it on the line that we will fight to help protect religious freedom throughout the world and certainly in Russia. 
So, Mr. President, I compliment my colleague from Oregon. I hope all my colleagues will support this amendment. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I want to join with my colleague from Mississippi in urging our colleagues to vote no on the McCain amendment. 
Mr. President, the entire process dealing with base closure is a process that Congress entered into with the administration, a joint process where we said we would work together, set up a commission, a commission of experts, we call it BRAC, the Base Closing Commission, and they would make recommendations and send those to the President. The President would either accept it or reject it. He could not modify it. If the President did not agree with those recommendations, he could send it back to the Base Closing Commission and they could change it. But he has two options: He accepts it or rejects it. 
Same thing with Congress. Under the procedure that was set up--I might mention, it worked quite well the first three rounds. The President took the recommendations; then he would forward those on to Congress, and then Congress accepted them. We could not amend it. We could not say that it included a base from the Senator from Montana's home State, the chairman of the Military Construction Subcommittee, so we will send that specific recommendation back, or maybe a recommendation to close a base in the home State of the Senator from South Carolina or Mississippi, those are powerful Senators, the chairman of the Armed Services Committee, and the majority leader respectively. 
We did not touch those. We did not set it up that way. We set it up so an independent commission of experts, appointed and I might mention confirmed by the Senate, would work and work very hard. One of the toughest jobs around was for this commission to travel to all the bases on the so-called suspect list or the possibility list. They would visit these bases, and then they would make their recommendations. 
I might mention in the process, they would probably terrify the individual communities and all the individuals associated with those bases. They would terrify them because they were afraid they might lose their job, they were afraid they might be on the final base closure list, they were afraid they might lose a job they think is a pretty good job--in all likelihood it is a good job, and they do not want to lose it. 
So Congress had to--I don't know if it should be called collective wisdom, but we said, `Let's put it on this group, these real experts, a lot of retired military people, people that are going to spend the time and really investigate and analyze which bases should be closed.' We have too much base infrastructure, so we had to close them. So that was the process. And it worked quite well the first three rounds. 
Then in the fourth round President Clinton changed it. We had the same Base Closure Commission, a good commission. They made their recommendations, sent it to the President, and said accept it or reject it. President Clinton did neither. He said: Well, we're going to accept all the recommendations except for two, except for ones in California and Texas. There are a lot of electoral votes. We have an election coming up. So he did not accept the base closure recommendation. 
He tried to modify it. He said: `Well, we won't close two bases. We'll privatize them and keep them in existence.' That was not what the Base Closure Commission had said. Congress did not have that option. We were not able to say, `Wait a minute, we want to close all these on the list except for--' We did not do that. 
So the President, in my opinion, violated the law. And I think the law is very clear. Other people debated, `Wait a minute. Does he have the flexibility? Does the Base Closing Commission 
give him the option to privatize in place or is this something he created?' I think it is something he created. That was not the intent of the Base Closing Commission. 
Could he fudge? Could he interpret it that way? Well, he did. So far he has gotten away with it. But that was not what the base closing law called for. That was not the intent of the Base Closing Commission. And certainly the President circumvented the will of the BRAC, and of the base closing process. I think he destroyed a lot of good will in the process. 
A lot of people might have been willing to say, well, we might comply with another round, but I will tell you, you cannot comply with another round if you think the executive branch might violate that trust or politicize this process. And that is exactly what President Clinton did. 
I might even read for my colleagues an op-ed article from the Washington Post at that time, July 14, 1995. I will just read this part of it.  
Over the past couple of weeks [President] Clinton has been engaged in a highly publicized effort to ensure that many of the jobs at McClellan Air Force Base in Sacramento will be privatized. That is rather disingenuous. If the privatization is real, it will merely perpetuate the expensive overcapacity that the base closing is supposed to reduce. If the private-sector jobs rapidly fade away after another election or two, the people who held them will rightly consider the whole effort a sham. 
What he had was an effort to win votes, and again violate the process. And so should we have another couple of base closing rounds? I do not think so. No, not as long as there is not an understanding that we are all going to be in this boat together, the President is going to abide by the law and Congress is going to abide by the law. The President certainly did circumvent the law in this case. 
I will read to you a quote from a speech President Clinton made in Texas. He said: 
On July 1st, you were dealt a serious blow when the Independent Base Closing Commission said that we ought to shut Kelly down. At my insistence and my refusal to go along with that specific recommendation, the Air Force developed the Privatization In Place Plan that will keep thousands of jobs here at this depot. 
That was made October 17, 1995. 
President Clinton is exactly right, he refused to go along with the specific recommendation of the Base Closing Commission. The point is, if he wanted to disavow the Base Closing Commission decision, he could have sent it back to the Commission. He said, `I will agree with all these, but not these two.' And that would have been the process to follow; he could have sent it back to the Base Closing Commission. 
Maybe they would have reconsidered; maybe they would not have. But he did not do that. He said: I am going to accept and amend. And the law did not give him that right. So he violated the process, and created a new process, and one, in my opinion, where he undermined the credibility that we have under this law that worked in the first three rounds and did not work in the fourth round. He politicized the process. 
Should we just have another two rounds? I do not think so. I just cannot see that Congress would allow another round or another two rounds and terrorize all these communities if they think, and the individual Members of Congress think, `Well, wait a minute. Maybe we're not going to do this on military value. Maybe we're going to do it on politics. Because politics entered the last round, maybe politics will be in the next round.' 
The President found a clever way of doing it. We do not have to close any base. We will just privatize in place. We do not have to lose any jobs. He promised in California--there were 8,700 jobs the day the base closures were announced, and he said, we will have 8,700 jobs in the year 2001. We will have 5,000 jobs a few years later than that. We will promise you jobs forever. That is not privatization in place. That is electoral politics. 
And it is a real shame he introduced election politics into the base closing process, some real violation of trust for every single Member that had a base closed in any round--any round. If you were willing to say, OK, we will put our bases at risk since we are all doing it together for the good of the country, for the good of national defense, I am willing to leave my rights alone as a Senator to participate in this process for the good of national defense and the good of our country because we know we have to do it, we know we have to reduce excess base capacity, if we are not going to play politics a lot of people said they are willing to do that. Then President Clinton plays politics. 
So, Mr. President, I strongly urge my colleagues to vote no on the McCain amendment. We should not have additional base closing rounds in this Senator's opinion until and unless we comply and until or unless we make absolutely, totally, completely, sure that politics will not be involved in any future round. 
I yield the floor.

Even if this substitute is not adopted, I urge them to vote against the McCain amendment, and the reason is, for the first time in the four base closing rounds, this administration played politics. They said, `Well, we're going to accept all of them except for two.' That has never happened. It didn't happen in the first round, it didn't happen in the second round, and it didn't happen in the third round. It happened in the fourth round. 
I don't think we should give them additional rounds until we have a clear understanding that we are not going to play politics. We are going to close bases on the merits and not on electoral votes. 
I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of the Dorgan-Lott substitute.

Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, on behalf of myself, Senator Hagel, Senator Abraham, Senator Domenici, and others, the amendment that we proposed last night we have modified. We did receive some requests from Senators to delete the provision that dealt with corporate deductibility of tax exempts. That was not a major portion of the amendment. We did delete that. 
I might mention I think it is a good provision. It is a provision that is in the House bill, so it will be in conference. 
Mr. President, this amendment accelerates self-employed deductibility for insurance. It allows self-employed individuals to be able to deduct a greater proportion of their health insurance needs. It increases it. For example, in 1997, current law is 40 percent; it increases it to 50 percent. In 1999 it increases it to 60 percent. And so on. 
Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the amendment.

Another way of saying that, this is a way for the Federal Government to spend more money. Costed out, the outlays will increase in this bill under this amendment by $22 billion over 5 years, by $47 billion over 10 years. 
I might mention, refundable credits are one of the most fraudulent in government. The EITC program has exploded. It has an error rate of over 25 percent. This is an amendment to redistribute wealth, and it denies tax credits for families that have incomes above $60,000. I urge my colleagues to vote no on this amendment.

I heard the Senator say the administration supports the amendment. The administration agreed to $16 billion for the so-called KIDCARE Program. That was the agreement. And then to see a letter by the administration that says now they support this amendment, that is ridiculous. 
The Finance Committee increased from $16 billion to $24 billion, more than I think is necessary for the program. The Finance Committee said, `That is all we will do.' Now we see the administration say they support this. When is a deal a deal? We can't trust this administration any more than a day. That is beyond belief. 
So now we have a program. Senator Kennedy introduced it as a $20 billion program. We are now financing it at $24 billion, 120 percent of what he originally asked for. He should say, `Hey, we won,' and now he comes back and says he wants another $12 billion, to make it $36 billion. The administration agreed to $16 billion. Now they are trying to make it $36 billion. Taxpayers cannot afford it. 
Finally, the net tax cut, if this amendment is passed, will be 60, not 85. It will be 60.

I might also mention that the Department of Education said, `The Department recommends that Congress rescind the 1995 appropriations for this program and provide no funding for 1996.'

Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I yield myself 10 minutes. 
Mr. President, first, I wish to urge my colleagues to vote no on Senator Daschle's substitute. I started to call it the Democratic substitute. I hope that is not the case. I really truly hope that is not the case, because we passed a bipartisan bill, one that had Democrats and Republicans supporting it. 
For those people that are saying this bill that was passed is for the wealthy and so on, that is absolutely hogwash. This bill that we passed in the Finance Committee is very family friendly. The bulk of the benefits, over 80 percent of the benefits, are for families with kids and/or education. The child tax credit, for example, starts phasing out with families or individuals that have incomes above $75,000. Personally, I think it should be for all families, but we did not make it that way. I think we should make it for all families. Upper-income people will not get it. 
So this idea that we are just benefiting upper-income people is absolutely not true. Upper-income people, the highest-income people, do not get the family tax credit. Everybody else does. I think we should make it apply to everybody, but we didn't. There are income limits on that. 
There are income limits on the education tax incentives. They start phasing out with individuals at $40,000 and couples at $80,000. A lot of times we will not be able to tell our constituents that everybody gets this. People with incomes up to $40,000 will get it if they are individuals or couples at $80,000, but above that they might not. We cannot brag about this too much because not all Americans get the education incentive. Not all Americans get the child tax credit. I tell you, a lot more Americans will get these tax benefits under the package that is before the Senate, the bipartisan finance company, than under Senator Daschle's alternative. 
Senator Daschle's alternative is redistribution of wealth. It 
is not a tax cut for taxpayers. It is using the tax system so we can channel more money to people that do not pay taxes in the first place. It is kind of complicated because he says we want people to get the child care tax credit, and then we also want them to get the earned-income credit in addition to that. Wait, what is he doing? On the child care tax credit, that is only $250. Ours is $500. Now, there is a little difference here. Ours is for $500, his is for $250. Ours apply to children up to age 18 and below age 13 everybody gets $500. In Senator Daschle's approach, they get $250. If they put it in an IRA, they get $350. That is the Government telling people what to do. Nobody gets any benefit under Senator Daschle's proposal if they are between ages 13 and 18 until the next century--until the year 2000. That does not make a lot of sense. He says he has a child credit, but it is only $250; but if you are 14 years old, you do not get anything under their proposal. 
Why? Well, the reason why he did that is to have the credit be refundable. I urge my colleagues when they say tax `credit refundable,' really what they mean is we want to have a spending program. This is not a program to cut taxes. It is a program for Uncle Sam to spend money through the tax credit. 
President Clinton likes this. There is a big increase in the so-called earned-income credit. I hope we change the name of that section of the Tax Code later on today or tomorrow. But they use that Tax Code as refundable tax credit to write people checks.

Mr. NICKLES. In 1990, the maximum benefit was $953 for a family with 2 or more children. In 1993 it was $1,511. This year, the maximum benefit for two children is $3,680, and 90 percent of that is not a tax credit. It is Uncle Sam writing a check. It is not reducing somebody's tax liability. In most cases these are not Federal income tax liabilities, but Uncle Sam writing a check. Somebody said that is to make up for payroll taxes. They pay Social Security taxes, yes, 7.65 percent, but the tax credit is 40 percent, far and above what they pay in Social Security taxes. 
I just mention to my colleagues, this is the welfare program, and our colleagues supporting Senator Daschle's amendment want to expand it. They want to give a child care tax credit and expand the earned-income credit, give both, so they can say we are giving money to low-income people. The Tax Code should not be for redistribution of wealth. If we are going to have a tax cut, it should be for taxpayers. 
They say this plan that passed the Finance Committee is unfair because it advantages upper income. Absolutely false. Eighty-two percent of this package in the first 5 years falls to families with incomes less than $75,000 or $80,000; 75 percent of the whole package falls to families less than $75,000.

Mr. NICKLES. How much of the benefit do they get out of this tax bill? The highest 10 percent pay almost half the tax. How much benefit do they get out of this bill: 13 percent. The highest 1 percent, the wealthiest people in this country, what percentage of the tax do they pay? They pay 18 percent. How much benefit do they get out of this bill? They pay 18 percent. Of the total tax 
bill of this cup, the highest 1 percent pay 18 percent of the total income tax. How much benefit do they get out of this bill: Two percent. Mr. President, the wealthy are not making away like bandits on this. 
This is a family-friendly tax bill. If one believes that we should put the majority of this money in to help families, we have done it in the Finance Committee package. We have done it with the tax credit that says if you have 3 children you get $1,500 that you get to keep, that you get to save, and if you pay $1,500 in income tax, a little over $100 a month, you get to keep it. It is yours. You decide how to spend it. That is in the bill that passed the Finance Committee. 
You can go to your constituents, as long as their incomes are less than $75,000 and say, what is your income tax, look at your W-2. If you have two kids, that is $1,000 a year you get to keep. If you have four kids, that is $2,000 of your money that you get to keep. That is in our proposal. It is not in the Democrat proposal. Senator Daschle's proposal is $250 for the first couple of years, $350 maybe if you put it into an IRA. 
Mr. President, there is no comparison between these two packages. Unfortunately, Senator Daschle's proposal is really redistribution of wealth. It is not a tax cut. The Finance Committee proposal that we have is not perfect, but at least it is very family friendly. The $500 tax credit is real. It will apply to all families up to incomes of $75,000, where we start phasing it out, $110,000 for couples on the child tax credit. 
I urge my colleagues to reject the Daschle amendment, have bipartisan support and overwhelmingly vote for passage of this bill and overwhelmingly reject another income redistribution scheme that is propagated by my colleagues on the other side. 
I might mention, as well, Mr. President, most of the people who have spoken out in favor of Senator Daschle's amendment, one, voted for the 1993 tax bill which was not a tax cut, it was a tax increase. They really have not been interested in tax cuts. They have been interested in tax increases. If you look at this proposal that they have, it is really trying to figure out how can we take more money from some people and give to somebody else. It is redistribution. 
Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to vote no on their proposal and to support the proposal that was reported out of the Finance Committee. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, one, I want to ask my colleagues to vote no on the Durbin-Bond amendment and tell them I think I have a pretty good record--I heard the support of NFIB for deductibility for the self-employed. I used to be self-employed, so I support that. 
For my colleagues' information, I will be offering an amendment after the Durbin amendment, very soon, that will accelerate and allow self-employed people to deduct a greater percentage for their health insurance at a much faster rate than now is under existing law. It does not go to 100 percent, but likewise we do not increase taxes another 10 cents, which I think a lot of people, not just from tobacco States, are saying `Wait, we are already increasing it 20 cents, almost doubling the tax, should we do another 10 cents?' 
I might mention the Finance Committee said we would stop at 20 cents. I do not think the Durbin amendment will become law. I want to let my colleagues know we will offer an amendment that will accelerate deductibility for the self-employed. We will be offering that subsequent to this so they can vote no on the Durbin amendment, vote yes on the amendment that Senator Hagel and I will be introducing momentarily that will give the self-employed a greater benefit for deducting their insurance. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, tonight I offer an amendment on behalf of myself, Senator Hagel, Senator Cleland, and Senator Domenici which would increase the deductibility of health insurance for self-employed individuals. I will not take long. I mentioned it a couple of times during debate on the Durbin amendment. 
The current law allows for self-employed persons to deduct 40 percent in 1997. We actually increased that--if I remember, Senator Dole, Senator Roth and several of us last year in the last Congress increased that--over several years, and eventually by the year 2004, it would be at 60 percent. We would like to accelerate that. That is what this amendment does. It would improve it from 1997, the year we are in, from 40 percent to 50 percent. In 1999, it improves it from 45 percent to 60 percent, and in the year 2003, it improves it from 50 percent to 80 percent, and so on. We want to improve and accelerate health insurance deductibility for the self-employed. 
Mr. President, I used to be self-employed, and it always bothered me that I used to manage a corporation and the corporation could deduct 100 percent of health care premiums, but my company, when I was self-employed--it was a janitor service--could only deduct 40 percent. I would like parity, and, hopefully, eventually we will get there. 
In this amendment, we don't get there for several years, but at least we will accelerate it and make a better deal for self-employed persons at a more rapid rate. 
On behalf of my colleagues cosponsoring this amendment, I send the amendment to the desk and ask for its consideration.

Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I compliment my colleague, Senator Gramm. We tried to do this in the Finance Committee. Unfortunately, we fell a couple votes short. But the basic principle is we want to tell everybody their kids are going to get the $500 tax credit, not to say, well, it only applies to people 13 or younger, that if you are older you have to put it into an educational IRA. 
I think educational IRA's are a good idea. I compliment Senator Roth because he has been the champion of IRA's, but it should be an option. It should not be mandatory. We should allow them to have this choice. I hope a lot of them choose it before age 13. I think it would be a great idea for a parent, if they can do it, if they can afford it, to put the $500 into an IRA for their child and let that accumulate and do that every year so they have a nest egg for their college expenses. It would be a positive thing for them and our country. 
But we should not mandate it. Presently, under the bill we mandate it for kids that are 14, 15, 16, 17 years old. I compliment my colleague from Texas and the cosponsors. 
I urge my colleagues to vote for this amendment to allow parents to choose whether they get the $500 tax credit to spend as they choose or whether or not to put it into an IRA. They should make that choice. We should not mandate it from Washington, DC.

Mr. NICKLES. I urge my colleagues to vote no on this motion. This motion basically says if we do not meet the targets we will have automatic tax increases. You did not hear it the other way around--you did not hear if we do meet the targets, we will have automatic decreases. 
The question is, are we spending too much, or are we taxing too little? The Senator from North Dakota obviously thinks if there is a deficit we need more taxes. We need to reach in and take more away from taxpayers. I disagree with that. That is the President's position. 
As the Senator from New Mexico said, he had automatic tax increases in the outyears. We did not agree with that in the leadership package with the President. We said no, the tax cuts will be permanent. They will be real, and they are not stacked toward higher income. Despite what some of my colleagues said, 82 percent of tax cuts are directed towards families with children and for education. That is family friendly. 
So I will just urge my colleagues, if we are going to have an automatic deficit reduction, make sure we meet the targets. Let's work on the spending side. Let's have something automatically that will reduce Government spending. I really do believe the problem is not that we are undertaxed. I really believe that the problem is we are overspent. 
I urge my colleagues to vote no on this motion.

Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, again, I just say that there are two sides to the question. We started some new spending programs. We have a program called Kid Care, and the agreement was for it to be $16 billion. It has grown already to $24 billion. Guess what? That additional $8 billion is only for 5 years. We do not even pretend it goes the next 5 years. So what about if that program explodes? 
My point being, the motion of the Senator from North Dakota is if we do not meet deficit targets we have automatic tax increases, or we will tell people they can have capital gains for 5 years but not beyond, or tell people they can have an IRA this year, but not in the future? 
I think we should restrain spending, not increase taxes. I urge my colleagues to vote no on this motion. 
I yield the balance of my time.

Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the amendment of Senator Kerrey. We put in language in this bill to make sure in this new program--we created a new program for health care for kids, for teenagers. What we are doing in this amendment is saying this health care program should not include abortion or money for elective abortion. 
We basically said no public funds would be used for abortion --only if the abortion is necessary to save the life of the mother or in cases of rape or incest. That is consistent with the Medicaid Program. That is consistent with Federal health care policies that we have for Federal employees right now, and we certainly should not create a new program that says, `Oh, you can have abortion on demand, paid for by taxpayers.' We will spend billions of dollars. We should not be saying those billions are eligible for teenagers for elective abortion. 
I urge my colleagues to vote no on the Kerrey amendment.

Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I wish to bring to the attention of the Senate the community contribution of the American independent retail grocers and their wholesalers. In past years, through the celebration of National Grocers Week, the House and Senate have recognized the important role these businesses play in our economy. The week of June 22-28, 1997, commemorates the eleventh year that National Grocers Week has been observed by the industry to encourage and recognize grocers' leadership in private sector initiatives. Across the nation, community grocers, through environmental initiatives, political involvement, and charitable support, demonstrate and build on the cornerstone of this great country--the entrepreneurial spirit. 
In this annual celebration, National Grocers Association (N.G.A) and the nation honor outstanding independent retail and wholesale grocers, state associations and food industry manufacturers for their community leadership with N.G.A.'s `Grocers Care' initiatives.

Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, of all the freedoms we enjoy in this country, the ability to own, care for, and develop private property is perhaps the most crucial to our free enterprise economy. In fact, our economy would cease to function without the incentives provided by private property. So sacred and important are these rights, that our forefathers chose to specifically protect them in the fifth amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which says in part, `nor shall private property be taken for public use, without just compensation.' 
Unfortunately, some Federal environmental, safety, and health laws are encouraging Government violation of private property rights, and it is a problem which is increasing in severity and frequency. We would all like to believe the Constitution will protect our property rights if they are threatened, but today that is simply not true. The only way for a person to protect their private property rights is in the courts, and far too few people have the time or money to take such action. Thus many citizens lose their fifth amendment rights simply because no procedures have been established to prevent Government takings. 
Many people in the Federal bureaucracy believe that public protection of health, safety, and the environment is not compatible with protection of private property rights. I disagree. In fact, the terrible environmental conditions exposed in Eastern Europe when the cold war ended lead me to believe that property ownership enhances environmental protection. As the residents of East Berlin and Prague know all too well, private owners are more effective caretakers of the environment than communist governments. 
Yet the question remains, how do we prevent overzealous bureaucrats from using their authority in ways which threaten property rights? 
Today I rise to join my colleague Senator Richard Shelby of Alabama in introducing legislation which will strengthen every citizen's fifth amendment rights. Our bill, the Private Property Owners Bill of Rights, targets two of the worst property rights offenders, the Endangered Species Act and the Wetlands Permitting Program established by Section 404 of the Clean Water Act. 
Our bill requires Federal agents who enter private property to gather information under either the Endangered Species Act or the Wetlands Permitting Program to first obtain the written consent of the landowner. While it is difficult to believe that such a basic right should need to be spelled out in law, overzealous bureaucrats and environmental radicals too often mistake private resources as their own. Property owners are also guaranteed the right of access to that information, the right to dispute its accuracy, and the right of an administrative appeal from decisions made under those laws. 
Most importantly, the Private Property Owners Bill of Rights guarantees compensation for a landowner whose property is devalued by $10,000, or 20 percent or more, of the fair market value resulting from a Federal action under the Endangered Species Act or Wetlands Permitting Program. An administrative process is established to give property owners a simple and inexpensive way to seek resolution of their takings claims. If we are to truly live up to the requirements of our Constitution, we must make this commitment. I believe this provision will work both to protect landowners from uncompensated takings and to discourage Government actions which would cause such takings. 
The time has come for farmers, ranchers, and other landowners to take a stand against violations of their private property rights by the Federal bureaucracy. The Private Property Owners Bill of Rights will help landowners take that stand.

Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I will be brief. I want to compliment my colleague from New Hampshire for offering this amendment. 
He mentioned this prohibition is not in the House bill. 
I hope to have something to do with the conference. I think he has brought out a very good point. We should allow some of these savings to go to the participants. So I appreciate his examination of the bill. That fact proves he has done his homework. I, for one, think he has pointed out a good option that we should allow to be available. I appreciate my colleague's attention in this matter. I will be happy to work with him to see if we can't come up with a good provision in conference.

<TEXT>
Mr. NICKLES. I thank my colleague from Delaware. I also want to compliment him for his stewardship as chairman of the Finance Committee on this bill. 
First, let me just say a couple of things about the comments Senator Kennedy made. `We are cutting Medicare so we can pay for tax cuts for wealthy people.' I heard that comment made 2 years ago. I heard it a lot. `They are gutting Medicare so they can pay for tax cuts for wealthy people.' 
Just an interesting footnote, the amount of expenditures, the outlays, what we are going to spend on Medicare for this 5 years that are covered by this bill is $1.248 trillion. The amount of outlays that we had in the bill 2 years ago that the President vetoed and said it was gutting, decimating Medicare, was $1.247 trillion--a one-billion-dollar difference. So the outlays are the same. 
Did we make this change, this change dealing with home health care, so we could pay for tax cuts? The answer is absolutely no. What we did, in a bipartisan fashion, I think without dissent in the Finance Committee, in putting in the $5 copay on home health care, is recognize that we need to make some policy changes in home health care. This program is exploding in cost, and the reason why is quite obvious, if you look at. It is a program that is paid for 100 percent by the Federal Government. There is no copay by the beneficiary; the beneficiary does not pay a dime. There is no payment by the State. There is no copayment by anybody. It is Uncle Sam writing a check for 100 percent of the cost. There is no limit on the number of visits; you can have one visit, you can have 300 visits. So it is a program, by its very design, if Uncle Sam is going to pay for it all, obviously it is going to explode in costs, and that is exactly what has happened. 
Just looking at this program, in 1990 this program cost $4 billion. In 1995, 5 years later, it cost $16 billion. It is projected next year to cost $21.1 billion. It has growth rates--in the year of 1989 this grew almost 24 percent; the next year, 53 percent; the next year, 43 percent; 1992, 41 percent; in 1993, 30 percent; in 1994, 30 percent; in 1995, 19.4 percent. This is a program that is exploding in cost. 
The Finance Committee realizes this. Anybody who has looked at the facts realizes this and knows we need to change it. So the change, a very modest change, I might say, is we say the beneficiaries would have a $5 copay. That is not a lot on visits that may well cost $70 or $80, but at least it is a start. And it might have some marginal impact on behavior. Will it cost the lowest of our citizens as alleged by Senator Kennedy and others? I doubt it, because in most cases they have Medigap policies or it is picked up by Medicaid. So in some cases those people will have coverage. But doesn't the policy of having some copay make sense? This Congress had the courage to stand up and say we should have a copay on veterans for prescription drugs of $2. Some people screamed and said, `Wait a minute, this is a breaking of a contract,' and so on, but we realized that prescription drugs for non-service-connected veterans was exploding in cost. So we stepped forward very marginally and set a $2 copay on prescription drugs, and it did change behavior somewhat. This will change behavior somewhat. 
I urge my colleagues to read an article on the front page of the Wall Street Journal about the explosion of this program. They have home health care providers now, some of which are starting new companies--they had no experience whatsoever--out of mobile homes. If you look at the number of providers, in 1991 there were a little less than 6,000 providers; in 1995, over 9,000 providers. Look at the number of beneficiaries, the total payment costs, the number of visits--this is a program that is truly exploding in cost. 
This was done in the Finance Committee, not so there could be greater tax cuts. As a matter of fact, I might mention--this is a little sore spot with me. The budget agreement said we would have $85 billion in net tax cuts. We did not end up with $85 
billion; we ended up with $77 billion. So we did not even come up with the total amount of net tax cuts that the budget agreement, President Clinton and the leadership, agreed upon. So that argument, `They did this so they could have more tax cuts', is total hogwash. This was done in order to try to reform a program that is growing way out of control, and it was done in a bipartisan fashion. I hope we will continue to have bipartisan support. We need to have bipartisan support. 
I will make a couple of other comments. One of the things that was done in the budget agreement I do not agree with. It said let's transfer home health care away from part A into part B, to make part A look solvent. That is a shell game. I do not want to have my fingerprints on it. It is in this deal. I don't have the votes to change that. But that bothers me. It doesn't keep part A solvent. Well, I guess theoretically it does. We could keep part A solvent if we said we will move all the expensive hospitals, from Tennessee west, take them out, move them out of part A and then we'll keep part A solvent. That's a little bit of a shell game. 
This is one little reform on the fastest growing portion in Medicare that is real reform. It was done in a bipartisan fashion because we know we need to do something to constrain these costs. You cannot have a program that has total, 100 percent, Federal funding, has no State match, no participant match whatsoever, and no limit on the number of visits and say we hope we can constrain its costs. 
So I think this is a serious vote. I urge my colleagues to vote against the Kennedy-Wellstone amendment.

Mr. NICKLES. I will be happy to. I think if my colleague had listened to my speech, I mentioned this home health program, which is currently 100 percent Federal with no State match. Right now the States are not paying anything. So to have this in Medicaid, where Medicaid will pick up for lower-income beneficiaries a small portion of that--I might mention the Federal Government picking up, in most cases, 60 percent, in some cases 70 percent--is not the problem. 
What we are asking to do, what you are talking about, we are saying, `Beneficiaries pay $5; pay $5 out of a total cost of a $70 visit.' So the Federal Government is paying 65 percent, and the individual would pick up $5, and in some low-income cases, for some low-income individuals, the State might pick up 30 percent, or in some cases 40 percent, in some States maybe 50 percent of that share. 
To me that does not seem unreasonable.

Mr. NICKLES. If I understood the Senator's statement, the $700 million the States would have to pick up, this is a program that will cost $121 billion next year for the Federal Government and that is growing at an unbelievable, unsustainable rate. So you are talking about a program over the next 5 years that is going to be well over $100 billion, and we are asking beneficiaries to pay $5, and in some cases the States may pick up a portion of that, maybe $700 million out of a total cost of over $100 billion. I don't find that unreasonable in any way.

Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, first, I wish to compliment several speakers, Senator Kerrey of Nebraska and Senator Conrad of North Dakota, for excellent statements, and Senator Gramm and others who spoke out on the need for policy change. 
Some of my colleagues on the other side say it was not in the budget agreement. That's right. The reason they can make a point of order is it has no financial impact over the next 5 years. The reason is, as proponents of this amendment, we wanted to give people plenty of time to make this change, to get rid of the eligibility time to be concurrent with Social Security. I urge my colleagues on the other side who are opposing this amendment to take a look at the estimate of 1997 Hospital Insurance Trustee Report regarding what the health of Medicare part A trust fund will be. It is going broke and it is going broke rapidly. 
Some of my colleagues say this bill keeps the trust fund solvent for 10 years. You will not hear this Senator say it because I do not think it is the case. We are making some changes. We are going to save $115 billion in Medicare. In addition, we are going to transfer home health, over a period of years phase it into part B, three-quarters of which is paid for by general revenues, by taxpayers. I do not think it keeps the trust fund solvent for 10 years. 
I am looking at the trust fund report. It says that by the year 2005 Medicare part A is going to have a $97.3 billion revenue shortfall, deficit; in Medicare alone, almost $100 billion by the year 2005, only 7.5 years from now. I fail to see how we are going to keep it solvent for 10 years. 
To address some long-term reforms, the Finance Committee passed some good policy changes that will make eligibility for Medicare concurrent with Social Security, and, yes, that means somebody my age is going to have to wait another year before he or she is eligible for Medicare. 
Well, guess what? Life expectancy has increased since 1965. Males age 65 are now expected to live 15.5 years and females age 65 will live 19 years. In 1965, a male age 65 would live on average only 13 years and a female 16 years. People are living longer. And the percentage of people who are paying into the system is decreasing. In 1965, we had 5.5 workers for every beneficiary. In 2030, there will only be 2.3 workers for every beneficiary. 
Some people seem to think the solution is raising taxes. If we want to keep the trust fund solvent for the next 25 years, the trustees say we should increase payroll taxes by 66 percent, and if you want to keep it solvent for 75 years, they say we should raise the current 2.9 percent tax--that is 1.45 percent for employee and employer--we should raise that to 7.22 percent immediately. I don't want to do that. I don't want to have that big a payroll tax increase. 
So what can we do to make the system more solvent? What can we do to make sure the money will be there when people need it? One of the things we can do, and one of the things that will come out of any report--any report--will say that we should have eligibility age be concurrent with Social Security. It is the right thing to do. 
I compliment my colleagues on the Finance Committee who have spoken on behalf of this amendment, as well as the chairman of the Finance Committee for putting it in. We didn't get any scoring for it. If anybody says we are doing it so you can pay for tax cuts for wealthy citizens, that is absolutely, totally, completely false. We got zero scoring for this, but it happens to be the right thing to do, and it happens to be in the long term, that this will help keep Medicare more solvent, it will help ensure there will be a Medicare program when I reach retirement age. It still won't solve the problems. I will tell my colleagues, even in spite of the fact we do--and we have to do it and the earlier we do it the better off so people have more time to know the changes are coming--in spite of this, we are still going to have to make further changes.

Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to vote against Senator Kennedy's amendment which would eliminate--some people call it income testing, means testing, but I would rephrase it. It would eliminate subsidies for upper income individuals on part B premiums. Right now the Federal policy is the taxpayers pay $3 for every $1 for all persons on Medicare part B. It does not make any difference if the person has $1 million of income. We are asking taxpayers with incomes of $20,000 to be paying general taxes 
to subsidize their premium. 
I do not think that is good policy. I might mention the Finance Committee, when we corrected this, we did it with bipartisan support. We have all known this issue. Some people say, well, let us substitute it. Let us do it in the commission. We know this should be done. We know this is good policy. 
I might also mention this was not done so we would have more money to spend someplace else. This was not done in order that we could have more tax cuts. The Finance Committee took 100 percent of the savings, of this amount of reducing subsidies for higher income individuals, 100 percent of that money and put it into part A solvency. 
So all the savings that come from the increased premiums on more affluent people by reducing subsidies, all the savings that come from that will go toward extending solvency in part A. And as I mentioned in an earlier speech, part A, the hospital insurance trust fund, has serious problems. It is going to have a shortfall in the year 2005, without these changes, of about $100 billion per year, and it grows from there. So we need to do more to save part A, to make sure the hospital bills will be able to be paid. 
The Finance Committee took this step. They took it for, I think, all the right reasons, for good policy, to eliminate subsidies for upper-income people. I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan recommendation that came out of the Finance Committee and to vote no on the Kennedy amendment.

Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, first, I wish to thank Senator Specter, Senator Torricelli, and Senator Inhofe for bringing this bill to the floor, and also Senator Lott for bringing it to the floor this quickly. 
I think it is somewhat of a tragedy. I read in today's paper that an official of the Department of Veterans Affairs said that Tim McVeigh would be eligible to be buried in a national cemetery. I think that would be a desecration of our national cemeteries. I think it would be an affront to all the veterans who are buried in a national cemetery and to their families. And so I want to compliment my colleagues for bringing this to the floor so quickly. 
In looking at the statutes, there is a forfeiture of veterans benefits for a lot of crimes: mutiny, sedition, harboring and concealing persons who have committed espionage crimes, gathering classified information for a foreign government, treason, rebellion, insurrection, and advocating the overthrow of the Government. But there is not for a Federal capital offense. 
Mr. McVeigh was found guilty by a jury, with a unanimous verdict of murdering--actually, I think the verdict was murdering eight Federal agents, Federal officers. He is responsible for the murdering or the deaths of 168 individuals, including 19 children. He planned this terrorist attack. It was not done at the spur of the moment. He planned it for months, maybe for years. He was found guilty. The jury has made, in my opinion, the appropriate sentence, a sentence that is appropriate for a crime of this magnitude--the death sentence. 
Certainly it would be a dishonor to our national cemeteries and the veterans if he was accorded veterans benefits, both financial benefits as well as burial rights in our national cemetery. I think it would desecrate the cemetery. I think that is certainly sacred ground, hallowed ground, honoring our national veterans, individuals that gave their lives in service to their country, individuals who served our country and were willing to give their lives. 
To have Mr. McVeigh buried alongside our national heroes I think would be a serious, serious mistake and a real denigration to our national heroes. 
So, Mr. President, I am happy to cosponsor this legislation. I am happy with the leadership of the Senate and the leadership of the Veterans' Affairs Committee, Senator Specter, and Mr. Torricelli, for bringing this to the floor of the Senate. And I am hopeful that it will receive a unanimous vote in this Senate and also be adopted by our colleagues in the House. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. President, when the Subcommittee on Energy Research, Development, Production, and Regulation of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee filed its report on H.R. 363, to amend section 2118 of the Energy Policy Act of 1992 to extend the Electric and Magnetic Fields Research and Public Information Dissemination program, the estimates from the Congressional Budget Office were not available. The report has now been received and I ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the Record for the information of the Senate and the public.

Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation with Senator Inhofe to establish the Oklahoma City National Memorial and create the Oklahoma City Memorial Trust. The memorial will commemorate the national tragedy ingrained in all of our minds that occurred in downtown Oklahoma City at 9:02 a.m. on April 19, 1995, in which 168 Americans lost their lives and countless thousands more lost family members and friends. 
The Oklahoma City National Memorial, to be established as a unit of the National Park Service, will serve as a monument to those whose lives were taken and others will bear the physical and mental scars for the rest of their days. It will stand as a testament to the hope, generosity, and courage shown by Oklahomans and fellow Americans across the country following the Oklahoma City bombing. This will be a place of remembrance, peace, spirituality, comfort, and learning. The memorial complex will include a special place for children, 19 of whom were killed in the blast, to assure them that the world holds far more good than bad. 
The memorial site will encompass the footprint of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building, Fifth Street between Robinson and Harvey, the site of the Water Resources Building, and the Journal Record Building. Both Park Service and non-Park Service personnel will staff the memorial grounds and interpretive center on the site. The Memorial Trust, comprised of nine unpaid trustees, will administer the operation, maintenance, management, and interpretation of the memorial. 
While the thousands of family members and friends of those killed in the bombing will forever bear scars of having their loved ones taken away, the Oklahoma City National Memorial will revere the memory of those lost and venerate the bonds that drew us all closer together as a result. 
I welcome all Members to cosponsor this important piece of legislation.

If our colleagues are going to object to the offer that the majority leader made, I do not think they are showing good faith, and that does not increase the likelihood of getting things done. 
Now, correct me if I am wrong; I ask the majority leader this question, the majority leader asked permission for the committees to meet?

Mr. NICKLES. Madam President, first, I objected to the unanimous-consent consideration. My friend and colleague from North Dakota expected it. He knew I would do so. He basically tried to pass the bill as designed by one Senator. That is not the way the legislative body works. The way the legislative body works is that there are procedures. It goes through committees. Senators add amendments trying to influence the behavior of Congress, trying to influence the behavior of Government, trying to set policy. That is what happened in this bill. 
I might tell my colleague from North Dakota I did not vote for the bill anyway. I think this bill was not just a disaster bill. This bill grew, and it grew too much. The President submitted a bill in, I think, early May, for approximately $4 billion. This bill grew to over $9 billion. I voted against it. 
Now, the President vetoed the bill, and he vetoed it supposedly because Congress put in a provision that says if, for whatever reason, we do not get an appropriation bill passed by the end of September, we will continue operating at this year's level of funding. I happen to think that is a perfectly responsible thing to do. The President does not like it. Maybe some Democrats do not like it, I guess because they want to spend a lot more money than this year's level. I think it was a responsible thing to do so we would avoid a shutdown, so Government employees, Government agencies, everyone would know that if in the event we did not pass an appropriation bill, we could continue operating at this year's level. I think that is proper. They did not. The President vetoed the bill. I wish he had not vetoed it for that reason. If I was President, I would have vetoed it because it spent too much money. That is one of the reasons why we have divisions of power. We happen to be equal branches. We do not just write an appropriation bill just designed by the President. If so, we would not have a Congress. We would just let the President write the bill. 
But that is not the way the system works. We have equal branches of Government. So the President can submit his proposal, and then we will act on it. He vetoed it, and we have a couple of options. We can vote to override the veto--in all likelihood, we do not have the votes to override the veto, and so then we will work with colleagues to see if we can come up with a proposal that will pass and get his signature. And that is the proper way to do it. It is not the proper way to do it to try to pass it by unanimous consent, a bill designed by one Senator. I, for one, would object because I think it spends too much money not even related to the two objections that my colleague from North Dakota had outlined.

Mr. NICKLES. Madam President, I understand my colleague did not like two provisions. Maybe the President did not like two provisions. It may well be the President will look at the rest of the bill and he will not like other provisions. My point being, we have two branches of Government, both equal, and the President can make a request and Congress disposes of it and he has the right to veto it. Evidently he has done that. I understand the majority leader of the Senate is trying to get in contact with him today and maybe some discussions will ensue. 
I also just happened to be looking at this report. The 
initial request was $4.5 billion in discretionary outlays. The committee report, the committee report as it came out of the Senate was $7.6 billion, so, in other words, $3 billion more than originally requested. The conference report, after it went to conference, was $8.6 billion. And if you add budget authority with the mandatory it was over $9.5 billion. 
So this, like a lot of urgent supplementals, grew, and many times they grow at the request of the administration. They did not make it in their initial request, but they asked for more money, and somebody else said, well, I think we should fund this and everyone was in agreement, both Democrats and Republicans, so we go ahead and fund it. What we wind up doing is we fund things in an urgent supplemental that, frankly, should be funded in the normal appropriations process. We should be in the process of passing normal appropriations bills now for next year so they do not have to be in the supplemental; we do not have to prefund them. We should fund it through the process. And I, for one, since evidently the President's vetoed this bill, hope we come in with a very streamlined, strictly urgent supplemental bill. 
And I, for one, have serious questions whether or not we should be funding Bosnia assistance in this. How can the Bosnia assistance be urgent? We have had the troops over there. We have known about it. You cannot say that is not expected. We have known the troops are over there. I know that they are raiding operation and maintenance accounts; they are drawing down those funds. We have underfunded defense in the past. But we have known we have had a significant peacekeeping force in Bosnia and we do not fund it. And so then we start saying, well, we need to fund it all of a sudden because we did not put enough money in for defense last time. 
We have known those troops are over there and should be funded. But the costs have risen significantly. We should get control of those costs. I have some reservations about whether or not we should have had those troops in the international peacekeeping force in the first place. The President puts them over there, underfunds them and asks us to bail him out with an urgent supplemental. I have some reservations about it. 
Mr. President, there is only two issues of dispute. One is on the census language, one is on whether or not we would have a continuing resolution to keep the Government open should we reach an impasse on appropriations. 
Just a couple of final comments. We have reached an impasse in appropriations the last 2 years, in 1995 and in 1996, prior to the last election. The way that was solved in 1996, prior to the election, was the President basically said I am going to shut Government down unless you give me a lot more money. Unfortunately, in my opinion, we succumbed to that temptation; we gave the President about $8.5 billion so we could get out of town. I hope we do not repeat that failure. 
Who was the real loser in that? Maybe Congressmen and Senators weren't, but I think the taxpayers lost. We wrote big checks. Discretionary spending really went up. It went up in some cases, Madam President, even more than the President requested so we could get out of town. I hope we do not replay that. 
So the essence of this continuing resolution was, if for whatever reason we have an impasse, let us at least continue operations at this year's level so we will avoid that disaster, so we will not have the curtailment, so we will not have the shutdown, and I still think it is good policy. I regret the President vetoing it for that reason. I think that was a mistake. He has that right to do it. 
I think it is important we follow constitutional procedures and keep in mind constitutional prerogatives. The President is President. He does not have the right to dictate every detail in an appropriation bill. He can veto every appropriation bill he does not like. I want to preserve that right. But likewise, we are an equal branch of Government and we have a right to put on language that a majority of Senators are supportive of. 
So I will work with my colleagues from North Dakota. I see another colleague, Senator Conrad, is here and wishes to speak on the issue, and I will not detain him. I know he has very strong feelings, as Senator Dorgan does, as well. And so I will work with my colleagues. Hopefully, we will be able to come up with another bill, one that will not cost taxpayers as much as the previous bill, and hopefully we will be able to break the impasse and provide needed relief in a timely manner. 
I yield the floor. 
Mr. CONRAD addressed the Chair.

Mr. NICKLES. Madam President, if my colleagues from Massachusetts and Louisiana and Montana wish to offer a substitute, they can vote for cloture. We can consider their amendment. I am happy to vote on their amendment. If other Senators have different ideas, we would like to get to the bill. Yet, our colleagues on the other side, they say, `We've got amendments,' but they do not let us vote on the amendments. 
They want to filibuster. They want to talk. But they do not want to vote. We want to vote. We want to give all Americans the same rights that we give Federal employees. 
If flextime is so bad, why don't my colleagues introduce a resolution or amendment to stop flextime for Federal employees? They can offer that as an amendment on this bill. Let us find out. 
Federal employees happen to like flextime. It works. It has not been abused. It is not employer-only. If my colleagues on the other side read the bill, it says `mutually agreeable.' It does not say the employer has the sole decision or the employee has the sole decision. It says `mutually agreeable.' That is in the bill. 
It works for Federal employees. Why don't we make it available for everybody else in America? Because my colleagues on the other side of the aisle do not trust Americans? They do not trust businesspeople? They do not trust employees to be able to make this decision? 
The bill allows people, if they try comptime and they do not like it and they accumulate some hours and they did not use it, they can cash out. The employer has to pay. That is not optional. If the employee wants out and says, `Hey, I don't like it. I want to go back to the old time where I can be paid overtime, be paid instead of comptime,' they can be paid. 
Our colleagues do not trust employees to be able to make that decision. They do not want to give them the choice to be able to say, `Wait a minute. I have something coming up next week. I would like to work an extra hour, maybe every night for 5 days so I can have Friday afternoon off with my kids.' They do not trust American women and American men to be able to make that kind of decision. 
They are saying they are going to deny that kind of decision. That is what they are doing by filibustering this bill. They are saying to all Americans, we think you should not be able to make that decision. We are going to preempt you from making that decision. 
I think that is a serious mistake. They do not trust American citizens, employers and employees, to be able to work out what is mutually agreeable. They are not going to allow employees, women or men, to be able to work, say, 9 hours a day for 8 or 9 days, and be able to take off every other Friday. 
Why won't they let them do that? Why don't we give Americans that opportunity to have that choice, have that option? We are not mandating it. We are trying to give them that option. 
So I want to compliment my colleague from Missouri. I ask unanimous consent for an additional minute, or ask my colleague for an additional minute.

Mr. NICKLES. I want to compliment my colleague from the State of Missouri who has given great leadership on this issue to give all Americans the same choice and options that we give Federal employees. I cannot believe my colleagues on the other side will not allow us to go forward with this bill. They can filibuster it. They may kill it. They may kill the whole darn thing. But I think they ought to be ashamed. If they want to vote for the Baucus amendment, let us vote for cloture. The Baucus amendment would be in order. Let us vote on it. 
Then for my colleague to say this is against working women, that is hogwash. Working Women magazine and Working Mother magazine both endorse this bill. This bill, particularly the flextime provision, is very positive for working women. 
I compliment my colleague and urge all of my colleagues to vote for cloture so we can help the working men and women of this country.

Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, with great respect for my colleague from Illinois, I urge our colleagues to vote no on this amendment. 
This amendment basically says, taxpayers, you pay $5 billion more in taxes and now we are going to have a new Federal program designed to build new schools or to renovate schools. 
Is that really a Federal responsibility? I do not think so. We already have the Federal Government involved in education in many areas; as a matter of fact, a lot more than I was quite aware of. I asked my staff to find out, and they told me. I heard originally the House said there were 760 programs. We find out now there are 788 programs. I asked my staff, how much does it cost? And they said about $100 billion, and I sent them an E-mail and said, `That can't be right.' 
It is right. I will insert it into the Record. It is $96.8 billion that we spend on these 788 programs. We have a little program for construction. The total cost of it is $627 million, I might mention. I am going to guess that is for military schools and Indian schools, and so on. But this says, well, let us have a $5 billion education building program, a new program, one that would have to comply with Federal rules, like Davis-Bacon. In other words, if a school is going to be built in South Dakota--they may have to build a new school in South Dakota because of the floods--they would have to build according to Federal rules, and that includes Davis-Bacon. That means the Federal Government is going to determine what the wage rates are. In all likelihood the wage rates might be 30 percent more than they are in South Dakota. So you get a lot less school built for the same amount of money. 
My point is that this really is not a Federal responsibility, and $5 billion cannot come close to scratching the surface of the need. I do not doubt that you could have a lot of pictures of dilapidated school buildings. Is that really the Federal Government's responsibility? I do not think it is. Even if we had a surplus, I do not think that is a Federal Government responsibility. 
How in the world could we in Washington, DC, decide which State, which school, which local area should have their schools fixed or renovated? If we made this available, I could see just for the District of Columbia or just for any State--New Mexico, Oklahoma, Illinois, any State--a lot of schools. A lot of cities have real needs. Are we going to be the superintendent? Are we going to be deciding who should get the renovation and who should not? We will not come close; $5 billion would not scratch the surface. I am sure $5 billion could not take care of all the public school needs in the State of Illinois or in the State of New York. 
So, my point being this is not a Federal responsibility. It is not a Federal obligation, and I think it would be a serious mistake for us to start down this line of new spending which would have an ever-growing demand that we would never be able to fill, so I urge my colleagues to vote no on the amendment.

Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, first, let me compliment my colleague from New Mexico for his leadership in putting this budget together. And I will make a speech a little later about the entire budget package. But I have a strong feeling, if this amendment should pass, we are not going to have a budget package. Maybe I will not have to give that speech. 
I was going to compliment my colleagues from New Mexico and from New Jersey and the majority leader of the Senate and the minority leader of the Senate, because they worked for hours, for weeks, they worked for a long time with the administration to put together a budget package. 
I will tell you I do not think everything in this budget package is perfect, but I am absolutely certain if we pass an amendment that increases taxes $30 billion and increases spending $20 billion over what is already in this package, we do not have a deal. We just killed the budget. There will not be a budget agreement. I believe that very strongly. I will be involved with several people trying to make sure that we do not do it. 
This deal is not very good from many people's perspective because it does not cut taxes very much. A net tax cut of $85 billion when we have total taxes in that period of time of over $9 trillion is not much. I argue it is better than nothing, but $85 billion of almost $10 trillion is not much. You reduce that to $55 billion, and I will say it is not worth it. 
I am a little bit bothered by my colleagues when I hear there is bipartisan agreement. Yesterday, we had an amendment on the floor to increase spending and taxes by $15 billion, again, breaking the budget deal. We had eight Democrats vote for that or vote to sustain the budget package. Everybody else said, `No we want another $15 billion more in spending and $15 billion in more taxes.' 
Now it looks like almost all the Democrats are going to jump on and say we want more money for this program. Senator Hatch and Senator Kennedy put together a good program. We do not care that the Budget Committee and the negotiators put in $16 billion; we are going to double it. We want $20 billion on top of it. It does not matter what you already did; we want more. It is like whatever that program is, hey, we are for more. The original bill that Senator Hatch and Senator Kennedy had only had $20 billion. The committee put in $16 billion. I do not know why they did not high five each other and say, `Hey, we won,' and I would probably be on the sideline saying, `Yes, they did. They got 80 percent of what they are looking for.' I will say I lost because I do not think we should have a new mandate. 
This is mandatory. It is mandatory under the Hatch-Kennedy bill, too. I heard people say it is not. I will be happy to read the language, and I know we are not adopting the Hatch-Kennedy bill, but we are debating it. We already have $16 billion, and now we are coming along with an amendment that says put another $20 billion on top, adding to it so now we will have $36 billion for this program. No one in their wildest dream would have said we should have $36 billion to try to solve this problem, which I will be happy to debate. 
Do we want to make sure that kids have insurance? Make sure they have access to health care? You bet. I have four kids. I want to make sure my kids have health care. I want to make sure your kids have health care. Is the solution a Federal mandate? I want to make sure kids have plenty to eat. Are we going to mandate a Federal program for that? I want to make sure kids have a warm home. Are we going to mandate everything? Government is big enough to give you everything you want. It is big enough to take everything you have. We are approaching that. 
A young child born today is already inheriting a debt of about $20,000. If we do not change the way we are doing our business now, a young person born today will spend 84 percent of their lifetime earnings paying taxes and paying for entitlements, working for Government--84 percent, if we do not start living within our means and start balancing the budget. 
So, first thing right out of the hopper--we have a budget bill that purportedly is to balance the budget within a few years; it has some fiscal discipline--the first thing we do, we had an amendment yesterday to increase spending another $15 billion and increase taxes $15 billion. Almost all the Democrats voted for it despite the so-called bipartisan budget, and now we have an amendment that says increase taxes $30 billion, increase taxes $20 billion, and I understand we are only going to get maybe a few Democrats who will vote against that amendment. Just break the deal. What deal? 
I absolutely tell you, Mr. President, if this amendment passes, there are going to be other amendments that say, `Hey, if taxes are on the table, maybe this $85 billion is not sacrosanct. I do not think that is enough.' 
Last Congress we had $245 billion that we passed and we balanced the budget. I thought that was a lot better tax package. We had real things in there for American families and it helped the economy. I would like it to be bigger than $85 billion. I will not be satisfied with $55 billion. My guess is there will not be a majority in this body satisfied with $55 billion, so if people want to kill this budget package in the name of saying, `Hey, no matter what you did, Budget Committee, in putting $16 billion in, we will double it because we are for kids and against tobacco.' I do not care that much about tobacco. Somebody wants a different tax, a different time, do 
it on the Finance Committee when we have the reconciliation bill before us, and they can say, `I do not like this, raise the tobacco tax.' They can have that amendment. It can be in order, and then you are playing with real bullets, then you are talking about something that is real. 
All this is, this budget resolution, if one turns to the budget resolution, all that says is we want to spend $2 billion more in the Finance Committee, $18 billion more in the Labor Committee, and we want to raise taxes $30 billion. That is all it says, and it directly violates the so-called budget deal. 
So we will find out before too long, are we for a budget package? Do we want to balance the budget? Or do we want to play games, and say, `I do not care, I am more for kids than you, so I want to increase it.' 
How much is needed? We have heard the statistics. There are 10 million kids uninsured. How long are they uninsured? A study was done that found that the majority of kids had insurance within 4 months. Well, we just eliminated half of the problem. Most of the kids have insurance within 4 months. People change jobs, people move, people have different reasons, but for whatever reason, a lot of those kids will have insurance within a short period of time. Of that 9.8 million group, about a third, over 3 million, already are eligible for insurance, they just have not signed up. Does that mean they will not get health care? No, my guess is, if they have an accident, they might go to Children's Hospital or something, they will be covered, and they already have vaccinations and so on, but for whatever reason, there is a program and now we come up with a bigger program, but they are already eligible. 
What about the group above 200 percent of poverty? For that group, a family of four that makes over $32,000 a year, they make enough money to provide kid care, health care for their children, they are just not doing it. We will make them do it? We will come up with big subsidies? What about the 3 million people that maybe are between the 100 percent of poverty and 200 percent of poverty? About 3.5 million kids fall in that category. Half of them will have insurance within 4 months. But you still have maybe 2 million children that are chronically uninsured. Mr. President, $16 billion is more than adequate to cover that chronically uninsured child, more than adequate. 
Yet we are saying $16 billion is not enough, make it $36 billion. We will match you and double it, so now we have $36 billion. If you look at the cost of kid care, in many cases it is $600, $700, $800, up to $1,000. A population of children between 100 percent of poverty and 200 percent of poverty, 3.5 million, most have insurance within 4 months, so you are only talking a couple million. You can do that for a couple billion a year. We have more than that in the $16 billion. Yet, no, we are coming up now with $36 billion. No, I do not think so. I do not think that is a solution. It may be good politics. 
Looking a little bit at the substance, we do not have the legislative language of the Hatch-Kennedy bill, but the Hatch-Kennedy bill, if someone reads it, one, they will find out it is a mandate. It mandates the Federal Government shall give money to the States. That is not optional. It is a mandate. Then looking at the subsidy, the subsidy for the group of nearly poor, not the Medicaid poor, the subsidy for this group is much more generous from the Federal Government standpoint than it is for Medicaid. Now, if we revamp and improve this program, we have Medicaid--Medicaid is a Federal-State program. It is supposed to be 50-50 cost shared, but in some cases the Federal Government is up to 70 percent or more. Under the Hatch-Kennedy bill, the Federal contribution is only 40 percent of whatever the State was putting in. If the State put in 50 percent, the State's share would be 25 percent. In many States the Federal share would be 90 percent. You have a lot of States right now that are only paying like 22 percent of Medicaid costs. The Federal Government is picking up 75 percent. Under the Hatch-Kennedy bill in a lot of States the Federal Government would be paying 90 percent. So we will have greater subsidies for the income eligibility between 100 percent and 200 and 300 percent, a greater share of Federal for the lowest income. That absolutely makes no sense, absolutely makes no sense whatever. 
Then to say you can do this in the Finance Committee, and then we will come up and double the program in the Labor Committee absolutely makes no sense. It is like, wait, we do not work together so we will have the Finance Committee solve this problem and then we will come over here and have the Labor Committee solve this problem and give both committees enough money to solve it. That makes no sense. 
Mr. President, I hope we will have colleagues on both sides who will be fiscally responsible and say let's work to balance the budget and work for America's kids. We are not solving America's children's problems by saddling them with another great big, open-ended, expensive entitlement program that can only explode in the future, wreck the budget deal, and totally destroy the budget package. I do not think that is good for kids. I think it is a disaster for children. I think if this amendment should pass, we will not have a budget deal and the 
real losers will be America's children.

Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I want to echo the comments made by my colleague from New Mexico. This is even more important than the budget agreement. 
You are only, in the Senate, as good as your word. There is a document that says we are going to have net tax cuts of 85. This makes net tax cuts 55. There is an addendum that says there is going to be a kid care initiative that costs 16. This amendment makes that kid care initiative 36. 
This is not the agreement. If people on the other side are now saying this is consistent with the agreement, that is not the case. And it really does unravel this deal. It is beyond me. 
I would like to think that people would have more credibility in their word and would say, `I will always tell you the truth.' If people are going to say this doesn't break the deal and the Vice President is going to come down and say this is consistent with the deal, then we don't have a deal. Some people are just evidently quite happy to break it up and make sure that we don't have a deal. 
I will go further to say that this is consistent with the deal. I can certainly have an amendment to cut discretionary spending by $20 billion and increase the tax cut by $30 billion. I would like to offer that amendment. Tell the majority leader, I would like to offer that amendment. I think we spent too much money on the discretionary side, and I think we didn't cut taxes enough. It wasn't my intention to offer that amendment because it would be inconsistent with the deal. 
I want a balanced budget. I want some tax relief. But this amendment, if it passes, tells me there won't be a budget. It tells me that people who `negotiated in good faith' can say that this is consistent. Frankly, that bothers me more than the amendment. It bothers me a lot. You have to be as good as your word. 
There is a package here that says here is the agreement. It says kid care, $16 billion. It didn't say 36. It said net tax cuts 85. It didn't say net tax cuts 55. I do not want to go to my constituents and say it was going to be 85 but now it turned out to be 55. But, boy, we got gypped. We didn't do what we said we were going to do. 
We ought to at least try to do what we said we were going to do, but yet we have not been here 1 day and people are undermining this agreement and, frankly, making allegations that this is consistent with the package when it absolutely is not. 
If this amendment should pass, this is one Senator who will not be supportive of this package. And it bothers me because I want to balance the budget. I want to provide some tax relief. I want us to help save Medicare, and I think the net result is the passage of this amendment says there will be no budget package this year. 
I hope people are aware of this when they cast this vote. I hope they do not think this is just a free vote. I hope they do not think the rest of the people are going to run over on this side and put this budget resolution together and pass a net tax cut of 55. I do not think that will be the case. I do not think it will happen. So I hope people will recognize we are not talking about trivial, little things, that we have legislation in here that encompasses the Hatch-Kennedy bill, but we do have language that says we are going to have a net tax cut of 55. There is a $30 billion tax increase. 
If somebody wants to raise taxes--and I hear my colleagues talk about this--if they want to raise taxes on tobacco, very easily they can wait until the reconciliation bill comes in the Chamber. The reconciliation bill, consistent with the budget package, will have a net tax cut of $85 billion. If they want to have an amendment to that tax cut that says they want to raise cigarette taxes and cut other taxes, that is consistent with the package; they can do that. They cannot come in and say, we want to spend an extra $20 billion in kid care that is not consistent with the package, but they could do that. And then they will be playing with the real bill. They are talking about real bullets. They are talking about taxes. 
If they want to raise cigarette taxes and cut other taxes, I might support them. I might help them draft it. But they cannot come in and say, hey, we are going to change the net side of this tax cut as this amendment proposes to do from 85 to 55. They cannot do it. It is not consistent. It is a deal-breaker. This says the agreement is not worth the paper it is written on. And if the President is going to come down here and endorse it by his vote, or his effort, his presence, that means we have a real credibility problem. We have a real credibility problem. 
This amendment is not consistent with the agreement, and I do not think anybody should make that allegation. This is a budget-breaker. This amendment basically says we do not want a budget this year. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.  
Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.

Mr. NICKLES. Madam President, I would like to make a couple comments about where we are, and I also wish to thank our colleague from California, as well as Louisiana, in saying there is an agreement; we ought to abide by it. 
I was looking at the budget agreement. There is one enclosure which says children's health, and it says 5-year expenditure, $16 billion. It is enclosed. It says we want to provide health care, $16 billion, 5 years, to provide health care for 5 million children by the year 2002. That is in the agreement. It is included. 
So for somebody to say that it was included in the agreement to add another $20 billion, to make this $16 billion $36 billion, is absolutely not the case. It really loses credibility, and it makes a lot of us wonder whether we can trust the White House, whether we can trust our colleagues in trying to implement a 5-year deal if we could not trust them basically for a day, not to mention we are trying to make obligations for the next 5 years. 
I am a little shaken. I will absolutely say I have wanted to support this deal, hope to support this deal, but when I hear some of the people who have negotiated it say it is within the context of the budget agreement to have $36 billion for child care, a new additional child care entitlement, when the provision clearly added to the budget resolution was $16 billion, not $36 billion, there is a difference. There is a big difference. 
Now, I want to make a few comments concerning the underlying bill that Senator Hatch and Senator Kennedy are promoting and maybe respond to some of the statements that were made and maybe challenging some provisions of this bill. 
I do not support the bill. I think the underlying bill that individuals are trying to promote--that is not what we are voting on. We do not have bill language added to this budget resolution. 
A budget resolution, for the information of colleagues and the public, is not a law. It is a guideline. It says spend so much money, tax so much money. This amendment spends $20 billion more and it raises taxes $30 billion more, both of which are inconsistent with the agreement, both of which, frankly, are outside the scope of the agreement. 
Now, should we pass it? I would say no. Should we pass the so-called Hatch-Kennedy bill? I would say no. I would tell my colleagues from Utah and Massachusetts, I think they did very well in this budget negotiation. They got 16 out of 20--that is 80 percent--for a new program, a new entitlement program when we are trying to balance the budget. I think they should be high-fiving each other and saying, hey, we won; we got 80 percent of what we want. We stuffed those people who really 
wanted to hold the lid on new programs. We beat them. But instead of saying, hey, we got 80 percent, we are happy, they came back and said, we are going to double our offer. We are not satisfied with 16. The original bill that they introduced was 20, but now they want 36. I just find that to be grossly fiscally irresponsible. 
Now I want to talk a little bit about the substance of the underlying bill. I heard my colleague say that, well, it is not an entitlement. And I have stated repeatedly that it is an entitlement. Let us look at the bill. If you look at page 19, it says `budgetary treatment.' `Authority in advance represents an obligation of the Federal Government to provide payments to the States.' 
An obligation. It does not sound like it is discretionary to me. An obligation for the Federal Government to provide payments to the States. 
Now, in the first place, maybe I should ask, the tobacco taxes envisioned, are those discretionary? I do not think so. All the States would have to pay into the program; all the States would be paying additional taxes. That is not discretionary. I don't think anybody has made that allegation. 
Page 19 says there is an obligation of the Federal Government to pay to the States. I mentioned earlier that the Federal mix of this is much more generous than under Medicaid, that the Federal Government would be paying, in many cases, 80 to 90 percent of the cost of this program, not 50-50, not splitting the cost with the States. The Federal Government paying 4 to 1, 5 to 1 what the States are paying. 
Now, sure, a State is going to opt out of that. If Uncle Sam is going to be paying 90 percent of the cost of the program, more generous than Medicaid, the States are going to opt out. First, the States have to pay the taxes and then you create a new entitlement program. The Federal Government is going to pay up to 90 percent of the cost of the program, and you say, oh, the States do not have to participate. They have to pay the taxes and then Uncle Sam will pay 90 percent of the costs, and the States are going to say, no, I don't think so. And then you look at the underlying provisions of the bill; what do the States have to do. If this is such an optional program, you need to look at page 6, `Requirements for Qualifying Children's Direct Benefit Option.' 
Page 7. `The States shall insure.' Paragraph 2: States shall insure, each participant shall insure, shall insure, shall provide, States may not, and on and on. States may not allow imposition of cost sharing; States may not enter into a contract, on and on. There are something like 30 `States shall' or `States may not' in this provision. This is not optional. All kinds of mandates, telling the States what to do with this program, including saying, States, you do not get another Medicaid waiver. 
Most States have Medicaid waivers pending. This says, `No more. Need not apply. Cannot do.' 
They don't want to touch on the issue of abortion, because I heard my colleague say this bill does not mandate abortion. I just disagree. I think people are entitled to their own opinion, but I don't think they are entitled to their own facts. If my colleagues would look at page 5 in the bill: For purposes of this title, qualifying children policy is a policy for an eligible child that provides coverage for medical care for such child that is the equivalent of medical assistance available for State child assistance available under title XIX of the Social Security Act. 
If this is available for a State plan, if abortion coverage is available in Medicaid under a State plan, then it must be provided under this plan. 
I know I heard my colleagues say, wait a minute, this is covered by Hyde language, and we don't pay for abortion under Hyde language. That is not what this says. This says, if abortion is a benefit under a State plan--and you have a lot of States, 14 States, including some of the biggest States, New York and California, for example, they have State-paid-for Medicaid coverage of abortion; 14 States have it. The Federal Government does not pay for it. But remember, Medicaid is a Federal-State program and some States have mandated State program benefits. In this case, the State pays for abortion coverage. 
This bill says that if the State provides this benefit, they have to provide the same benefits they provide under the State Medicaid plan. It does not say Federal Medicaid plan. It doesn't say only Federal Medicaid benefits. It says State Medicaid benefits. So you have 14 States that now have State-paid-for abortion coverage that would have to have it under this plan. It is in the bill. It is on page 5, line 19 through 25. 
So I just make that point. I want to be very factual. This bill leaves a lot to be desired. We should not set up a new entitlement and have the Federal Government paying 80 or 90 percent of the costs of Medicaid coverage for kids when we do not pay that much for the lowest income. This is a higher level than for the lowest income level. We are going to have a greater subsidy for this group than we are for the lowest group? I don't think so. 
What we have is we have the situation now where we find ourselves, where we have the $16 billion entitlement--I think it should be discretionary under the underlying bill--$16 billion to provide health care for kids that, for whatever reason, do not have insurance. 
I might review that scope because I have heard people say, wait a minute, we are going to provide health care for 10 million kids. Let us look at that scope. Madam President, 3.3 million of those kids already are eligible. They have health care. They are eligible for Medicaid. They qualify. About a third of them have incomes above 200 percent of poverty. If they are a family of 4, if they have an income of $32,000 or more, we should not be buying them insurance. That is not the Federal Government's role. So you have about 3.5 million between 100 percent of poverty and 200 percent of poverty. You have 30-some-odd States that already have coverage for kids in excess of the Medicaid eligibility standard, Medicaid eligibility standards going up to 133 percent of poverty. Thirty-some-odd States, 39 States, have Medicaid coverage in excess of Federal mandates. We are going to preempt those in this case, and we are going to provide a very expensive Federal mandate on the States to provide that coverage for that 3.5 million, which, I might mention, half of those kids will have insurance within 4 months. 
So, really, the chronically uninsured population is probably around 2 million. The underlying bill provides $16 billion. It starts out at a couple of billion and grows to 2.5 billion, 3.5 billion, almost 4 billion over that period of time. That is enough, maybe more than enough, to provide ample coverage for the chronically uninsured child. 
What we do not need to do is say: Here is $16 billion--the original Hatch-Kennedy bill had $20 billion--so they have $16 billion. They have 80 percent of what they are looking for. Then they want to, maybe--I don't know what the purpose is--to say now we want $20 billion on top of our $16 billion, we want $36 billion, even though in the bill they originally introduced, they wanted $20 billion. Now the demand is for $36 billion--certainly a budget buster. Certainly a deal breaker. 
If we have a deal that says new kid care entitlement is $16 billion, and we are going to have an amendment and just make it $36 billion; if we are going to have a deal that says net tax reduction is going to be 85, and then all of a sudden it turns into 55, then we don't have a deal. That means maybe we cannot trust people. If we cannot trust people, that does not speak very well for this institution. 
I urge my colleagues, if and when we get to an up-or-down vote on the Hatch-Kennedy bill, I urge them to vote `no'. First, because it is a deal breaker, and, second, I urge them to vote `no' 
because this is not good policy and we do not need to do it twice. We do not need to try to solve this problem on uninsured kids both in the Finance Committee and the Labor Committee and give equal amounts of money for both to solve this problem. 
I ask unanimous consent for an additional minute.

Mr. NICKLES. Madam President, to conclude, a couple of points. A deal is a deal. If we are going to break the deal, if we are going to be amending what the size of the tax cut is, if people want to do that, then I am going to have an amendment. This amendment cuts the size of the tax cut by $30 billion. I am going to have an amendment to increase the tax cut by $30 billion. If this amendment spends $20 billion more, I am going to have an amendment to spend less money someplace else. 
In other words, this bill unravels the whole package and people will find out this is not the easiest package to craft. There is no question it unravels the package, if one would just look at the budget package we already have. So I urge my colleagues, if for no other reason, to vote `no'. 
Also, likewise, I urge them to vote no on the substance. Somebody said something about, wait a minute, because you are trying to defend tobacco--that is hogwash. If my colleagues want to have an amendment to raise tobacco prices, let them do it. But let's not be doubling the size of the new entitlement program before the new entitlement program even starts. Let's not more than double it in the name of fiscal austerity. It is ridiculous. When the tax package comes out, if people want to, on the reconciliation bill, if they want to have an increase in the tobacco tax, so be it. If we offset it with another tax reduction, maybe I will support it. But let's not do it in this package. This, in my opinion, would be a killer amendment and certainly should be defeated. I yield the floor.

Mr. NICKLES. Madam President, I rise in opposition to the amendment, and in answer to the question, obviously Davis-Bacon applies, because all Federal contracting dealing with Federal money would apply. We would have the Federal Government setting wage determination rates. So I object to this amendment for that reason, but also for other reasons. The Federal Government does not have a primary responsibility of trying to build new schools or to rebuild schools. That is not a Federal responsibility. 
Some people say, `Well, we need more education money, we need more education programs.' We have 788 education programs spending $98 billion a year spread all throughout the Government. One that we don't have, if we adopted the Senator's amendment, would be a $5 billion school building program. That is one program we do not need, and we cannot afford. 
Schools are the primary function of State and local government, and to build or rebuild or to figure out which schools should be rehabbed, that really should be decided by local and State government. That should not be decided by Washington, DC. Contingent with that money comes Federal strings, regulations, such as Davis-Bacon. The Federal Government would be determining what the wage rates would be to comply, to rehab the school building. Some of those wage rates are outlandish in comparison to what is normally paid for schools or for other buildings and projects in those areas. 
With greatest respect for my colleague from Illinois, I know her intentions are very sincere and I know a lot of schools need to be rehabbed, I know a lot of schools need to be replaced, I know a lot of schools are in pathetic shape, but it is not the function or responsibility of the Federal Government to try and solve all the problems and certainly not the construction of local schools or the rehab of local schools, which, I might mention, $5 billion would hardly scratch the surface. Then we would have to have the Federal Government determine if the needs in the hundreds of billions of dollars--how is the Federal Government going to determine who wins and who loses? I imagine you could spend $5 billion for school renovation in the State of Texas alone. Quite possibly, I imagine the State of Illinois alone. 
So you have all this competition amongst the various schools and States for who is going to get this money. This is not a function for the Federal Government. The 10th amendment to the Constitution says all other rights and powers are reserved to the States. We should certainly leave this one, school construction and renovation, to the States and to the localities, not to the Federal Government. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Domestic Oil and Gas Production and Preservation Act. This legislation is an effort to help revive our domestic oil and gas industry which plays such a vital role in our national security. If our domestic industry is to survive, then Congress needs to act now to provide tax incentives to encourage production in America. 
Since the early 1980's, oil and gas extraction employment has been cut in half. Employment in the oil and gas industry has declined by 500,000 since 1984. Imports of crude oil products were $68 billion in 1996, up 24 percent over last year and the import dependency ratio now exceeds 50 percent. From 1973 to 1996, crude oil production dropped 44 percent in the lower 48 States. We must take action now to save domestic production not only for the sake of the oil and gas industry but for the sake of the national security of this Nation. 
To date, the Clinton administration has done nothing to encourage domestic production. In fact, in 1996, crude oil reserves continued to decline by 788 million barrels. Natural gas reserves fell by 2,600 Bcf to 162,415 Bcf. In the President's budget there is nothing to aid this industry. That is why I am introducing this bill today. 
The Domestic Oil and Gas Production and Preservation Act is intended to do just what its name implies--encourage oil and gas production and preserve and revitalize the domestic oil and gas industry. This bill would accomplish these goals through specific tax proposals. Section 2 of the bill would allow current expensing of geological and geophysical costs incurred domestically including the Outer Continental Shelf. These costs are an important and integral part of exploration and production for oil and natural gas, and should be expensed. 
In addition to the G&G expensing, this bill provides for the elimination of the net income limit on percentage depletion. Currently, the net income limitation requires percentage depletion to be calculated on a property-by-property basis and disallows depletion to the extent it exceeds the net income from a particular property, thus discouraging producers from investing income from other oil and gas properties to maintain marginal wells. 
Furthermore, this bill clarifies that delay rental payments are deductible, at the election of the taxpayer, as ordinary and necessary business expenses. This clarifies an otherwise gray area in Treasury regulations and eliminates costly administrative and compliance burdens on both taxpayers and the IRS. It would also extend the 90-day prepayment period to 180 days for determining when deductions may be taken on certain oil and gas investments. Harsh winter conditions in many States make the current 90-day limitation for commercial drilling impractical. 
Lastly, section 6 includes hydro injection as a tertiary recovery method for purposes of the enhanced oil recovery credit. Although the Treasury Department is tasked with continued evaluations and editions to the list of recovery methods covered under the EOR, they have proven notably lax in pursuing this objective. By legislating this outcome, this bill keeps domestic production of our endangered marginal wells on the cutting edge of available technology. 
Collectively, the provisions of this bill provide much-needed incentives to an industry that is vital to our national security. The sooner the administration and Congress acknowledge the critical importance of the domestic oil and gas industry and stop burdening this industry with high taxes and regulatory obstacles, the sooner we can take the necessary actions to preserve and revitalize this important sector of our economy.

Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, first, I would like to compliment my colleague from Pennsylvania, Senator Santorum, in addition Senator Smith of New Hampshire, who brought this issue to the floor of the Senate last Congress and maybe educated everybody in the Congress and maybe in the country about this very gruesome procedure which, unfortunately, happens all too many times. The President said it doesn't happen very many times. But now we found out it happens thousands of times. In one clinic in New Jersey it happened 1,500 times. 
So I compliment my colleagues from Pennsylvania and from New Hampshire, and also Senator DeWine and Senator Frist, who spoke very eloquently about this issue. It is not an easy issue. It is not one that I think a lot of us look forward to debating. 
Mr. President, I speak on this issue on occasion. Again, it is not one that I particularly like to speak on. Maybe I did it for a lot of reasons. Somebody said, `Why does Congress always have debates on abortion?' 
I think part of the premise goes back to the fact that the Supreme Court legalized abortion. They legalized abortion in the Roe versus Wade decision. Everybody acknowledges that. I have a problem any time the Supreme Court legalizes or legislates in any area. I look at the Constitution. Article I says Congress shall pass all laws--Congress being comprised of the House and the Senate, elected bodies. 
People have a choice. If they don't like the laws we pass, they can change Members of Congress. 
In 1973, the Supreme Court legalized abortion. They overturned laws in almost every State that had some restrictions dealing with abortion and basically decided by trimesters what was legal and what was not legal. I object to that process. 
Colleagues who really think that we should legalize abortion or preempt all State laws, or some State laws, should introduce such legislation, and, if they have the votes, they can codify Roe versus Wade, or they can change it. But they should do it through legislative process not do it through a nonelected judicial process of the Supreme Court. 
So I object to the Supreme Court legislating. I think that they have done a pretty crummy job in their legislating. 
Our colleagues are aware of the fact--because we had this debate last year and now we have this debate before us today--that there is a procedure called partial-birth abortions where the baby is almost totally delivered, yet its head is held inside, scissors are inserted into the baby's head, and the brains are sucked out. Then the dead baby is delivered. 
We are trying to ban that procedure. Senator Daschle has an amendment. I looked at the headline. It says: `Daschle Abortion Ban Spares `Viable' fetuses.' 
If I believed that headline, I would support the amendment. But I look at the amendment. What does it do? In the first place, it is a substitute. If it was in addition to the language before us, maybe we would have something to talk about. But it isn't. It is a substitute. It strikes the language. 
If you look at the language of the amendment, it strikes all of the prohibition on banning partial-birth abortions and says let's insert the following. 
So it totally eliminates the bill that has already passed the House of Representatives by an over two-thirds vote, and a bill that we voted on last year when we had overwhelming support. We didn't have two-thirds. It strikes that, and says let's start over. 
We just saw the language today. It was just inserted today. We have not had enough time to totally review it. But I have read it. I have some problems with it. 
If the real purpose of it is to spare viable fetuses, I am 
going to support it. But I don't think that is the case. I want to go into the language and maybe point out what I think is deficient in the language and then tell my colleagues and my friend, the minority leader, that I will be happy to work with him. Maybe we can come up with language that would accomplish the objective of sparing viable fetuses. I will work with any Senator to try to do that. I will be happy to. But I don't think the language that we have in front of us today does that. I will go into a statement to illustrate it. 
Mr. President, the amendment that we have before us includes the health exception that is said to be `stricter than the Republican measure,' what it says on the headline. But, in reality, the exception contained in this amendment is no exception at all, but a large hole, a large protection for late-term abortions. 
The proposal is--as George Will accurately characterized it in his April 24, 1997, column--`a law that is impossible to violate.' 
That's one reason this amendment has been termed by critics `the abortionist empowerment clause.' 
While this amendment claims to protect viable unborn children from abortion, a closer look shows that it provides no protection at all. 
The amendment would make it `unlawful for a physician to abort a viable fetus. * * *' 
Who determines whether a particular fetus is viable? 
There is no definition of `viability' in federal law. Nor does this amendment define `viability.' 
The prevailing standard of viability in federal law was set by the Supreme Court in Planned Parenthood of Central Missouri versus Danforth. In that case, the Court held: 
The determination of whether a particular fetus is viable is, and must be, a matter for the judgment of the responsible attending physician. 
In other words, the person who performs the abortion decides whether the baby he or she is aborting is viable. This is the standard that governs the Daschle amendment. 
The abortionist decides whether the baby is viable. The abortionist doesn't even have to certify his decision. Unless he voluntarily says to a U.S. attorney that the baby he aborted is viable, no civil penalty can be brought against him. 
Let's say that an abortionist tells a U.S. attorney that he has aborted a viable baby. In order to avoid civil action, the abortionist need only `certif[y] that the continuation of the pregnancy would threaten the mother's life or risk grievous injury to her physical health.' 
To whom does the physician certify? Does he file a certification with the Justice Department? With HHS? With the state licensing authority? With a notation in the patient's file? The amendment doesn't say. 
When does the physician certify? Before he performs the abortion? After he performs the abortion? After he is called into question for having performed the abortion? The amendment doesn't say. 
It merely says that by `certifying,' he avoids civil action for having aborted a viable infant, and it leaves it to the Secretary of HHS to develop regulations defining what the certification entails. 
A physician who aborts a viable child must certify that `the continuation of the pregnancy would threaten the mother's life or risk grievous injury to her physical health.' 
While the amendment defines `grievous injury,' it does not define `risk.' 
The risk of continuing a particular pregnancy may be small, but that is irrelevant under the Daschle amendment. 
The risk of carrying a pregnancy to term may carry less risk in a particular case than the risk of terminating the pregnancy, but that doesn't matter under the Daschle amendment. 
The only relevant question is `does the abortionist believe that the `continuation of the pregnancy' poses any risk of `grievous injury?' Since every pregnancy poses at least some risk, an abortionist can justify any abortion under the Daschle amendment. 
The Daschle amendment states that a physician must certify--under penalty of perjury--`that, in his or her best medical judgment, the abortion involved was medically necessary.' 
Unfortunately, as with other provisions of this amendment, the perjury penalty is very difficult, if not impossible, to enforce. 
The abortionist only has to sign a paper that asserts that `in his or her best medical judgment,' the 
abortionist believes that `the continuation of the pregnancy would . . . . risk grievous injury to her physical health.' 
The certification is based not on objective medical facts but on the abortionist's subjective judgment. 
If the certification by an abortionist was challenged in an action for perjury, the question before the court would not be about medical facts but on whether the physician believed that he had exercised his best medical judgment. 
Impossible, impossible to bring a conviction. 
I think that every abortionist would certify he had exercised his best judgment when he aborted a baby, whether viable or no. For example, Dr. Warren Hern, who performs third-trimester abortions in Colorado, said of this amendment: `I will certify that any pregnancy is a threat to a woman's life and could cause grievous injury to her physical health.' So long as Dr. Hern says he used his best medical judgment in making these certifications, he could not be prosecuted for perjury under this amendment. So this amendment, in my opinion, would be ineffective, totally ineffective in protecting viable unborn infants. 
Mr. President, I ask the sponsor if I can have an additional 2 minutes.

Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, we have to ask the question Senator Smith asked us: Why kill a viable baby? That is another aspect of this amendment that troubles me a lot. The amendment allows for the destruction of viable unborn children. 
A group of physicians headed by my colleague from Oklahoma, Dr. Tom Coburn, and the Physicians' Ad Hoc Coalition for Truth, states that it is `never medically necessary, in order to protect a woman's life, health or future fertility, to deliberately kill an unborn child in the second or third trimester of pregnancy.' He is an obstetrician. He has delivered hundreds, thousands of babies. I have not. But he has made that statement. Dr. Koop has made that statement. I happen to give them credit. I think the child would like for us to give them that credit. 
So the Daschle amendment would be ineffective in protecting viable unborn infants. 
Mr. President, a big difference between the Daschle amendment and the amendment by the Senator from California that was defeated earlier today is that the Daschle amendment does not include a `mental health' exception. 
The distinguished Democratic leader, in speaking with the press earlier this week, said that his amendment does not contain `a simple mental health loophole.' 
But he then added, `It's my understanding based upon an extraordinary number of conversations and consultations that mental problems ultimately, in situations involving pregnancy and abortion, evidence themselves physically.' 
Thus, while the amendment does not contain a simple mental health loophole, the author of the amendment believes that mental illness can have physical manifestations that would possibly justify late-term abortions. 
The Daschle amendment would not eliminate the vast majority of all partial-birth abortions. 
Ron Fitzsimmons, the executive director of the National Coalition for Abortion Providers admitted he lied about the frequency and necessity of partial-birth procedures. 
He told the American Medical News that the vast majority of partial-birth abortion are performed in the 20-plus week range on healthy fetuses and healthy mothers. `The abortion rights folks know it, the anti-abortion folks know it, and so, probably, does everyone else.' 
Yet this amendment would permit most partial-birth abortions since they are usually performed during the 2d trimester of pregnancy. 
The amendment prohibits abortions of viable infants unless there is a risk of grievous injury to the mother's life or health. 
Abortionists who violate this law are subject to fines and suspension of their medical licenses. No provision is made for any review of the physician's certification or the medical basis for it. 
Unfortunately, since the abortionist determines the health of the mother and the viability of the baby, no punishment would result no matter what the evidence. 
In order for someone to be prosecuted under this amendment they would have to voluntarily report that the child they had aborted was viable and that the abortion they had performed was not medically necessary. 
Does anyone imagine a physician would ever volunteer for such a penalty? 
It would be as if we allowed each driver to decide whether or not he or she was speeding. The only people who would receive speeding tickets would be those who voluntarily reported to the police that they had exceeded the speed limit. 
Self-enforcement is no enforcement. And that is what the Daschle amendment would put in place. 
I just conclude with the statement, Mr. President, this is a vitally important issue. I do not question the motives of my colleagues on the other side of this issue. I hope maybe we can come up with some type of a ban on aborting viable fetuses. But I believe this language in the first paragraph of the bill, language that says it shall be unlawful for a physician to abort a viable fetus when the physician makes that determination, unless the physician certifies--and he can do that, basically, by saying it is his best medical judgment that the continuation of the pregnancy would threaten the mother's life or risk grievous injury to her physical health--any risk, every pregnancy has risk--I am afraid that this language is so riddled with loopholes that it would provide no protection whatsoever, that it would have no real impact whatsoever. 
So I urge my colleagues to vote `no' on the Daschle amendment, to support the ban on partial-birth abortions, and then let us see if we cannot work together in the intervening couple of months, through the proper committees, have hearings, have suggestions from experts, health experts, and maybe we can refine language comparable to this to provide real protection for unborn children.

Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I wish to join with my friend and colleagues from Florida and Virginia, in stating my strong support for this amendment. 
Mr. President, let me state, at the outset, I wish we had an amendment that would strike the $793 million that was added on in the Appropriations Committee. In my opinion, it does not belong in this so-called urgent supplemental. I have been wondering, how does this bill grow from about $4.6 billion to almost $8 billion, about $793 million are in roads and highways. You think, if they are going to put in more for roads and highways--I am not contesting the $139 million; I don't guess anybody is. But the additional $793 million, I am contesting. Again, I think the proper motion would be to strike it, and somebody says, why aren't you doing that, because we have cloture? I understand from the Parliamentarian that that motion to strike is not in order. Maybe I should have gotten that amendment in at an earlier time, and I regret that. 
At least the amendment of the Senator from Virginia says, if we are going to have the additional $793 million, let's allocate it according to existing law. We have spent days on this floor fighting allocation formulas. A lot of us are not satisfied with those. We end up sending a lot more to Washington, DC, in roads and highway taxes than we get back. And then we look at the amendment that comes out of the Appropriations Committee and say, well, this makes it worse. We don't really find that acceptable. 
So I just make the comment that, really, the $793 million should be allocated according to the formulas we have agreed to. It should not be changed to the disadvantage of many States. We are going to fight the allocation of the formula fight again this year, in this Congress, on the ISTEA bill. We will have plenty of time to debate it and time for the committees. The chairman of the Transportation Subcommittee, Senator Warner, and his committee will mark up that bill. We will have it on the floor. Every Senator will have a chance to have their input on that. That is the way we should fight for the allocation process. We should not be changing it on a supplemental--`urgent supplemental'--appropriations bill. It doesn't belong here. I urge the conferees, since the motion to strike is not in order, to drop everything in conference except for the $139 million. This urgent supplemental, in my opinion, is getting loaded with a lot of things we can't afford, and maybe we are not legislating in the proper way. We should not be doing this on an appropriations bill. We should be doing it on the authorization bills. 
So I urge my colleagues, at the minimum, if we are going to put in additional money, let's allocate it according to existing law, as Senator Warner provided in his amendment.

Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I wish to compliment my colleague from Pennsylvania for his statement as well as Senator Gramm, for this amendment. 
I find this amendment to be very important and one I certainly hope will pass. The Senator from Pennsylvania said we want to provide economic assistance for the victims of this most recent flood. I agree with that. Senator Gramm says we ought to pay for it. I agree with that. We should pay for it. If we do not, if we pass this bill as it is right now, we are going to be increasing the national debt by $6.5 billion--not this year but over several years. 
Senator Gramm's amendment says let us do it in two ways. Let us have an across-the-board reduction of about 1.8 or 1.9 percent this year to fund the outlays for this year. For the second part of that, for the outlays that will be strung out over the next 5 years, let us reduce the outlays in those years. We are going to be spending about $1.6, $1.7, $1.8, $1.9, $2 trillion dollars in those successive years. Surely we can afford the couple of billion dollars in outlays in those years. We can have offsets. We can pay for it. We can reduce outlays in those future years by an amount to pay for this disaster relief. 
We ought to pay for it. We ought to say yes, we want to help the people with the floods, but we want to pay for it. We should be responsible. Let us not increase the national debt by $6.5 billion. If we do not pass this amendment that is exactly what we are going to do. So I urge my colleagues, this proposal--and I have the greatest of sympathy for the victims of this flood but the President requested $4.6 billion in discretionary spending and the committee proposes $7.7 billion in discretionary spending. If you include the mandatory spending the President requested, $6.2 billion, and in this bill that is $9.5. If you include discretionary and mandatory, it is about $3, $3.1 billion over what the President originally requested. I do not want to pass that much money. I am bothered. We had a vote earlier on the highway bill. We had several hundred million dollars, $773 million, I believe, in highway funding that was not requested that was added to this bill. The funding formula was changed. We get into a funding fight. People voted for what was best for their States. But, frankly, that did not belong in this bill and we find there are hundreds of millions of other dollars that do not belong in this bill. 
I hope when this bill goes to conference it comes back a lot leaner, that it really is constrained to disaster relief. 
Then, likewise, I hope that we will pay for it. I heard a lot of people say we should pay for it. Frankly, as the bill is written right now, this bill increases national debt over this 5-year, 6-year period of time $6.5 billion. Let's pay for it. Let's pay for it this year by a small, less than 2 percent reduction for the next few months. That is certainly manageable. Then for the future years, let's reduce spending enough to pay for it. 
I think it is a responsible amendment. I think it is fiscally responsible. I think it is the right thing to do, and I urge my colleagues to support the amendment.

Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, today I join my colleague from West Virginia, Senator Rockefeller, to introduce legislation to reform the Alternative Minimum Tax, or AMT. We are joined in this effort by 13 of our colleagues, including a total of 10 Finance Committee members. 
Congress created the AMT in 1986 to prevent businesses from using tax loopholes, such as the investment tax credit or safe harbor leasing, to pay little or no tax. The use of these tax preferences sometimes resulted in companies reporting healthy `book' income to their shareholders but little taxable income to the government. 
Therefore, to create a perception of fairness, Congress created the AMT. The AMT requires taxpayers to calculate their taxes once under regular tax rules, and again under AMT rules which deny accelerated depreciation, net operating losses, foreign tax credits, and other deductions and credits. The taxpayer then pays the higher amount, and the difference between their AMT tax and their regular tax is credited to offset future regular tax liability if it eventually falls below their AMT tax liability. 
Unfortunately, Mr. President, in the real world the AMT has reached far beyond its original purpose. As it is currently structured, the AMT is a massive, complicated, parallel tax code which places huge burdens on capital intensive companies. Corporations must now plan for and comply with two tax codes instead of one. Further, the elimination of accelerated depreciation increases the cost of investment and makes U.S. businesses uncompetitive with foreign companies. 
It makes little sense, Mr. President, to allow a reasonable business deduction under one tax code, and then take it away through another tax code. Perhaps there are some bureaucrats who believe regular tax depreciation is too generous and should be curtailed, but the AMT is an extremely complicated and convoluted way to accomplish that goal. 
The legislation I am introducing today would correct this problem by allowing businesses to use the same depreciation system for AMT purposes as they use for regular tax purposes. This one simple reform removes the disincentive to invest in job-producing assets and greatly simplifies compliance and reporting. In fact, this reform was first suggested by President Clinton in 1993. 
Further, my bill helps AMT taxpayers recover their AMT credits in a more reasonable timeframe than under current law. Many capital-intensive businesses have become chronic AMT taxpayers, a situation that was not contemplated when the AMT was created. These companies continue to pay AMT year after year with no relief in sight, and as a matter of function they accumulate millions in unused AMT credits. These credits are a tax on future, unearned revenues which may never materialize, and because of the time-value of money their value to the taxpayer decreases every year. 
Since Congress did not intend for the AMT to become a permanent tax system for certain taxpayers, my bill would allow chronic AMT taxpayers to use AMT credits which are 5-years-old or older to offset up to 50 percent of their current-year tentative minimum tax. This provision will help chronic AMT taxpayers dig their way out of the AMT and allow them to recoup at least a portion of these accelerated tax payments in a reasonable manner and time-frame. 
Mr. President, as the Senate begins working out the details of the recent bipartisan budget accord and the resulting tax bill, I hope we will not forget the importance of savings and investment. In that regard, there are few tax code changes we could make which are more important than eliminating the investment disincentives created by the AMT. 
Does my legislation fix all of the AMT's problems? No, it does not. This bill specifically addresses the depreciation adjustment, but there are many other AMT adjustments, preferences, and limitations which are unchanged. Some of these, such as the 90-percent net operating loss limitation and the foreign tax credit limitation, are very damaging to business profitability and competitiveness. I hope all these issues will be examined when the Senate Finance Committee considers AMT reform.

Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, earlier today, I voted against the D'Amato amendment, which would reinstate SSI benefits for legal nonresidents. 
I think 11 Senators voted against that amendment. 
Mr. President, I rise to make a statement about why I voted against that amendment. I know a lot of people said they voted for it because it is part of the budget package that was agreed to by the leadership of Congress and the President. They wanted to reinstate that. They said they might as well do it anyway because the budget is going to pass and the benefit will be reinstated. That may well be. These individuals will lose their benefits for 2 weeks in August and the month of September--6 weeks--if that happens. But I didn't think that was the reason why it should be put in the urgent supplemental. 
Some colleagues probably voted with me on that because they didn't think it belonged in there, that it can be included in the budget package. It may well be included in a budget package. That is when we will do the entire budget. 
So my point is--I informed my colleagues on this side of the aisle--if we have other amendments on this supplemental that try to pull out various pieces of the budget package and put it into the supplemental, and they say, `Everybody has agreed, the leadership has agreed, that we are going to spend more money for education, let's go ahead and put it in the supplemental, we are going to spend more money for children that do not have health care, we will put into a supplemental'--I disagree. This is supposed to be an urgent supplemental. It is supposed to be helping people with disaster assistance, and not to be prefunding part of the budget package. 
At least I for one--and I am the only one--in the future, if we find other amendments that try to maybe prefund the budget agreement, I am going to object. 
Also, I want to touch on this a little bit. Some people said, `Well, we need to undo part of this welfare package.' I happen to be one that disagrees with that. We passed significant welfare reform, and I think rightfully so. We said, yes, we are going to provide more benefits for citizens than noncitizens. Somebody said they are here legally. That is correct. 
Let me give a couple of facts. Since 1882, an alien who was likely to become a public charge has been subject to exclusion from the United States. Since 1917, an alien who becomes a public charge within 5 years of entry has been subject to deportation from the country. That continues to be the immigration policy, that aliens within our Nation's borders should not depend on public resources to meet their needs, but rather rely on their own capabilities and the resources of their families and their sponsors. That is the way it should be. 
Families of immigrants who enter the United States signed affidavits of support. By these affidavits of support they pledge to provide for the immigrants themselves and not put them on public assistance. That is a pledge. That says they will not become a public charge. That is to make sure that when people come to the United States, they are seeking citizenship and freedom, and not seeking welfare. 
We found with this program, unfortunately, despite these policies, that large numbers of sponsors have failed to live up to their obligations, both their moral obligations and their financial obligations. 
Just a couple of facts: In 1986, just over 200,000 noncitizens were receiving SSI welfare benefits. In 1996, that figure had grown to 800,000, 4 times as many in a period of 10 years. It didn't double or triple--4 times as many; it went from 200,000 to 800,000 in the last 10 years. The Social Security Administration predicts that the number of noncitizens receiving benefits would grow to 1 million by the end of the decade. 
So this is exploding. A lot of people are bringing their families over, saying, `Yes, you can be on welfare. You can be on welfare for life. You get cash payments, cash assistance, several hundreds of dollars per month, and be eligible for Medicaid concurrently.' It is a pretty good deal. A lot of people said, `I want in on that.' So they would come over and totally ignore the affidavits of support that they and their families pledged they would not became a public charge. 
In the welfare bill that we passed last year, they should get around this by becoming citizens. Now, I know a lot of people are becoming citizens. Some people said, `Well, the States don't have the resources. Not everybody can become a citizen.' You have minimal English requirements. Maybe they are not able to make that. The States save millions, and collectively the States save billions of dollars in the welfare changes we made last year. There is plenty of money to provide assistance to those people that really need some help. 
Total noncitizen applications for SSI alone increased almost 600 percent from 1982 to 1994, compared to just a 49-percent increase amongst citizens. Most noncitizens apply for welfare within 5 years of arriving in the United States. 
Mr. President, I want to make these comments. I know that in the budget package we have--I hope that we will pass a budget package--we are going to address this issue. I know, in all likelihood, for most noncitizens we will be continuing SSI payments for those noncitizens who are already here or 
already here at the time of enactment of the welfare bill. That may well be. I might support it as part of an overall package. 
But I voted in opposition to this being added to the supplemental because I didn't want to cherry-pick a few of the things out of the budget package and say, `Let's put it on this supplemental too.' This wasn't going to happen. No one would lose benefits now for another 3 months. Our objective is to pass the reconciliation bill to implement the balanced budget by July 4, a full month and a half before you would have discontinuance of benefits. So we would have time to rectify the situation if we have not reached the budget agreement. 
So, Mr. President, I just make mention of that, and maybe forewarn my colleagues. At least this Senator's intention is to object strenuously if future efforts are made to put parts of the budget package onto this urgent supplemental. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. NICKLES. I thank the Chair. I thank my colleague from Vermont for his leadership and also for having the hearing today that discussed project labor agreements. 
I told my friend from Massachusetts that I did not have a problem with Alexis Herman being Secretary of Labor as much as I had a real problem with what I perceive to be legislation by Executive order. 
There was proposed to be an Executive order dealing with project labor agreements that, as it was read by me and many other people, basically would have excluded nonunion companies from bidding on over $200 million of work per year. I think that requires legislation, and if Congress wants to legislate that, certainly Congress has the right to legislate that. I told the White House my hope and desire would be that if they want to legislate, to find someone to introduce that legislation, we would take it up in the legislative process. 
So I have had for the past few weeks objected to considering this nomination, trying to get the White House to back off from that order. I might inform our colleagues--somebody said, well, what caused this change of events? The White House has now agreed not to issue the Executive order, and I appreciate that. They have said that they were going to issue a memorandum from the President to the executive agencies, and that is certainly within their right. The memorandum does not have the force and effect of law. 
My purpose was to make sure that the administration did not try to legislate by Executive order. We now have a letter from Erskine Bowles that I will just read. 
This is to confirm the administration's intention to issue a Presidential memorandum encouraging executive departments and agencies to consider utilizing project labor agreements in Federal Government construction projects. The President believes that such agreements are desirable in circumstances where they promote efficient and high quality contract performance and labor/management stability. 
It is also our understanding, as I say, very frankly, they are not going to do it by Executive order. So that is the reason why I am withdrawing my objection and have no objection to the Senate voting on the nomination of Alexis Herman to be the next Labor Secretary. 
So I appreciate the cooperation of the White House and think this is the proper way to proceed. If they wish to legislate on project labor agreements, certainly they have the right to introduce that legislation and we will consider it in due process.

Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, first I would like to compliment my colleague from Arizona, Senator Kyl, for an excellent statement. I happen to think that this amendment we are debating is the key amendment of the entire debate. I certainly compliment all Senators for their involvement in this debate. I think it has been one of the best debates we have had in the Senate for a long time. It is also one of the most important issues we have had where we have seen so many colleagues, particularly on this side of the aisle, who have been undecided and probably because of this language dealing with article X and article XI. 
This is the language we have heard former Defense Secretary Cheney, former Secretary of Defense Schlesinger, and Cap Weinberger, really speak out against in their statements before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. 
Also, I note that President Clinton has a letter addressing this issue. But I looked at it a little bit more. I certainly concur with the goals and objectives; we want to reduce chemical weapons. And we have taken a laudatory step of saying we are going to ban them in this country and we want to encourage other countries to ban them, and I think that is great. And that is in article I. I see article I is over here, and if one reads article I it looks great. But I think it is incumbent upon us as Senators to read the balance of the treaty. 
When you read article X, and it is in the treaty, it says: 
Each State Party undertakes to facilitate, and shall have the right to participate in, the fullest possible exchange of equipment, material and scientific and technological information concerning means of protection against chemical weapons. 
Share defensive technology. I know the administration said, well, we are not going to do that. But it is in the treaty that we are going to. I find that a little contradictory, we are going to limit what we are going to share. This says to the fullest extent possible. The language is very contradictory in what the administration says they are going to do in subsequent letters and what the language of the treaty is. I think maybe the language of the treaty will supersede. 
If we are signing a treaty, don't we mean to comply with all of it. And then again we are not just talking about the United States, because I hope that we don't just give our technology away to some countries, some countries that will sign this convention and will not comply. We know that. We have had some experience. We have seen it not only with the Geneva Protocol on chemical weapons, but we also have seen it with the biological weapons convention which a lot of countries signed but they have not complied with and we know that. Our intelligence community has done a pretty good job, and in many cases we know a lot of countries are not complying. 
But I think it is legitimate to ask, are we better off with it or without. And I have heard good debate on both sides. But this language says to me we have to share this technology. Not only do we have to but also other countries, including countries like China, would be sharing this technology with Iran. Under the treaty, they would be obliged to, or certainly that is what they will be saying. Does that increase the likelihood and the dangers of chemical weapons? I am afraid it does. 
And then looking at article XI, and again just looking at the treaty and looking at the language of the treaty--every once in a while I think it is important we do it--under article XI, section 2(c) it says: 
Not maintain among themselves any restrictions, including those in any international agreements, incompatible with the obligations undertaken under this convention, which would restrict or impede trade and the development and promotion of scientific and technological knowledge in the field of chemistry for industrial, agricultural, research, medical, pharmaceutical or other peaceful purposes. 
In other words, we want a lot more trade in other chemicals that aren't banned by this treaty.

Mr. NICKLES. This article lists about 20 chemicals that are not prohibited by this treaty, that basically this section of article XI says you will be able to sell those chemicals. As a matter of fact, no restriction. This language says that countries cannot maintain amongst themselves any restrictions including those in any international agreements. It does not say some. It says any international agreements. That sounds pretty open. A lot of those chemicals can be used to develop chemical weapons. They can also have a dual purpose. It can be kind of confusing. 
I understand the President in his letter today said, well, he would try to end the confusion. And so I looked at his letter, and in his letter on page 2 he says--dealing with article X, he said: 
Using article X to justify providing defensive chemical weapon equipment, material or information to another State Party that could result in U.S. chemical protective equipment being compromised so that U.S. war fighting capabilities in a chemical weapons environment are significantly degraded. 
If that is the case, he wants out. What is `significantly degraded'? How do you reach that level. I do not know that you would ever reach--since he has `significantly degraded,' I do not know, because the word `significantly' is there that it would ever be treated. And then in (b) he talks about where it would be impossible for him to make a certification on the Australia Group. But in the final language he says we would get out if the implementing of this convention carries out transfers or exchanges under either article X or XI which jeopardize U.S. national security by promoting chemical weapons proliferation. When is that going to be triggered? 
His final conclusion is kind of interesting. I read the AP story that said, well, because of the President's letter, he said if these things happen, we are out of there, we are going to walk away from the treaty. I do not read that in his language. It says I would be prepared to withdraw. It did not say he would withdraw. So if it really jeopardizes our national security, he might be prepared, but it did not say he would withdraw, after consulting with Congress. 
In other words, I do not find a lot in this letter that gives me any real comfort or assurance that article X or XI has really been addressed. And I appreciate the fact that a lot of our colleagues have addressed this issue, but to me treaties are important. And we have had a lot of significant discussion over various sections of the treaty, maybe none more than article X and XI, but it happens to still be in the treaty. And the President's letter notwithstanding, at the conclusion of his letter he said if all these things happen or any of these things happen, I would be prepared to withdraw. 
Frankly, Senator Kyl is right. That is not going to happen in 2 or 3 years. It is not going to happen under President Clinton's term. I do not know that this letter would be binding on succeeding or successors of the President. 
So, Mr. President, this language is vitally important. I would tell my colleague from North Carolina my vote on final passage depends on this amendment. If we are able to make this change by the Senator from North Carolina, I will vote maybe for final passage. I think this is a killer amendment, having it in the treaty. I think it is that important. We are ratifying the entire treaty including article X, including article XI. And again I compliment my colleagues. I have the greatest respect for Senator Lugar. I know he has worked hard on this. I have the greatest respect for Senator McCain and a lot of other people on both sides of the aisle. They have conducted an excellent debate. I have made a long list of pluses and minuses on this treaty. I could debate either side of the treaty, I have spent just that amount of time on it. 
But I happen to think that this article X and article XI do a lot of damage. Since we are ratifying not just article I, but the entire treaty, I urge my colleagues to vote to delete the section. I urge my colleagues to vote no on this. I think this is the most important amendment and discussion that we will have to date. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, an April 15, 1997 letter to the Wall Street Journal, which I will insert for the Record, describes one family's recent experience with the estate tax. 
The letter states, `We finally did it. We didn't want to, but we had no choice. Exactly nine months after my father-in-law died, my wife and I signed a check for $1,285,000 payable to the Internal Revenue Service.' 
The man who wrote this letter goes on to talk about what his family could have used that money for, such as buying a beach house, prepaying their kids' college education, or even retiring. 
Instead, he calculates that the federal government will spend in 26.8 seconds what took his father-in-law 75 years to accumulate. 
After I read this letter, I decided to do some calculations of my own. In 1997, the federal government will collect $19.2 billion in estate taxes from 37,200 Americans. The federal government will spend that $19.2 billion in 4.3 days. Assuming each of those decedents was 70 years old when they died, that represents more than 2.6 million years' worth of work and savings which will be wiped-out forever and spent by the government in less than five days. 
Mr. President, some people mistakenly believe estate taxes only affect the rich. In the Washington Post this week, Deputy Treasury Secretary Larry Summers says in response to a question about the estate tax, `You have to raise revenue somewhere, and ability to pay seems like a good way to do it.' 
The truth is that there are thousands of small businesses and farms throughout the country owned and operated by middle-income Americans that are affected by the estate tax. In 
Oklahoma alone, statistics from the U.S. Census of Agriculture indicate that over 7,500 farms and ranches have a value that could trigger estate tax. Even those who do not end up paying the tax will spend thousands of dollars planning to avoid it or insuring against it. 
What is the ultimate impact of all this uneconomic activity? According to the Small Business Administration, only 30 percent of family businesses are passed down to a second generation, and only 13 percent make it to a third generation. 
It does not take a lot of success in business or investing these days to become a `taxable estate' in the eyes of Uncle Sam. With the explosive growth in mutual fund investments over the last several years, and the corresponding increase in stock prices, workers will retire and discover their pension plan to be much larger than they had anticipated. Aggressive business owners who reinvest all their profits back into their business will find themselves asset-rich and cash-poor. 
Under current law, a taxable estate of $1 million faces a marginal tax rate of 39 percent. A taxable estate of $3 million qualifies you for a confiscatory 55 percent marginal tax rate. A tax credit limits the tax on the first $600,000 of the estate. 
If a person starts a small business--be it a farm, a restaurant, or a car dealership--and they work hard, expand, and become successful, why should Uncle Sam be entitled to 39 percent or 55 percent of it? What did the government do to build that business? 
This business owner has already paid annual income tax (twice if organized as a corporation), self-employment tax, FICA tax, FUTA tax, and capital gains tax. Why should the Government come in and say, after all these taxes are paid, `We want over half of everything that's left'? 
Mr. President, the current estate tax is unfair and it is counterproductive. In the long term, it needs to be repealed. In the short term, it needs to be dramatically changed. 
I am introducing legislation today which represents dramatic change in the short term and provides a stepping-stone to eventual repeal. My bill goes right to the basic problem, which is estate tax rates. With seventeen marginal tax rate brackets ranging from 18 percent to 55 percent, estate tax rates are too complex and too high. 
Under my legislation, taxable estates and gifts under $1 million will pay no tax, taxable estates and gifts from $1 million to $10 million will be taxed at a marginal rate of 20 percent, and taxable estates and gifts over $10 million will be taxed at a marginal rate of 30 percent. 
Mr. President, this legislation benefits all taxpayers by simplifying the structure of the estate tax and reducing the number of tax brackets from seventeen to three. Further, by increasing the basic exemption from $600,000 to $1 million, it will reduce the number of estates subject to taxation by more than 40 percent and greatly reduce the need for and cost of estate tax planning. 
The benefits of this legislation are also progressive. A taxable estate worth $1 million will have its tax liability completely eliminated. A taxable estate worth $5 million will receive a 64 percent reduction in tax liability, and a taxable estate worth $50 million will receive a 50 percent reduction in tax liability. 
Finally, the benefits of this legislation are fair. It does not single-out certain types of estate assets for preferential treatment, and thus avoids the problems of picking winners and losers. 
The enactment of estate tax reform this year will not be very easy, Mr. President, despite broad, bipartisan support in the Senate and the House. The Clinton administration continues to block estate tax reform with partisan, class-warfare rhetoric. In the Washington Post article I mentioned earlier about estate tax reform, Deputy Secretary Summers even said, `When it comes to the estate tax, there is no case other than selfishness.' 
I find that statement offensive, and I wonder if President Clinton agrees with his lieutenant. Is passing your life's work on to your children is `selfish'? 
I encourage all my colleagues to read the letter I submitted with my statement today and ask themselves, `Is our estate tax policy promoting freedom, family, and opportunity, or does it just promote the redistribution of wealth?'

Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I want to compliment my colleague from Georgia for his managing this past hour. I hope that my colleagues have had a chance to listen very clearly. 
I would also like to compliment my colleague from Indiana on his very forceful statement denouncing the statement that was in the paper today, reported to be made by Mr. Summers, Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Treasury, when he said that those who want to cut inheritance taxes are wanting to do so for greedy individuals. I just totally disagree. I am one of those individuals who wants to reduce the inheritance tax, and I don't think I am trying to do it for greedy individuals. I think the tax is unfair. It is too high. 
The Senator from Indiana mentioned the fact that farmers and ranchers worked hard in their lifetime to build up a ranch, farm, or estate, and find that Uncle Sam is taking 39 percent, maybe 45 percent, or 55 percent of that estate. I think it is too high. It is higher even than the income tax. 
If you have a taxable estate of $1 million and you are at the 39 percent tax bracket, that is too much. Why should the Government be entitled to take 39 percent of a farm or ranch that has a value of $1.6 million--there is a $600,000 exemption and a $1 million estate--why should Uncle Sam be entitled to take 40 percent, or, if you have a taxable estate of $3 million, maybe two or three restaurants or businesses that you put together and the taxable estate is $3 million, why should Uncle Sam be entitled to take over half? 
Mr. Summers may think you are being greedy because you don't want to lose half of what you have built and worked all your life to accumulate, and you want to pass it on to your children. He thinks maybe you are trying to be greedy because you want to keep it in the family. Mr. Summers is wrong. 
I concur with my colleague from Indiana. I hope that the administration will denounce, renounce, or disassociate themselves from his remarks because trying to reduce the inheritance tax is not being greedy. 
I tell my colleagues that this is one Senator who is going to be very energetic in trying to make sure, when that tax bill comes up this year, that we are going to have estate tax relief. 
I hope we will cut estate taxes for everybody. I hope we will increase the exemption because I do not think the Federal Government should be entitled to take part of the property that people have worked their lifetime to pass on to their children. I do not think Uncle Sam should be entitled to take 40 or 50 or 55 percent. 
Mr. President, I am not sure what time remains of Senator Coverdell's time, but I ask unanimous consent to speak as if in morning business for 10 minutes.

Mr. NICKLES. I would like to follow up on some of the statements that have been made by our colleagues concerning the executive branch's current willingness to legislate by Executive order. I have talked to the White House two or three times now. I have let it be known that I want to use whatever tools are available to get their attention and make sure they quit attempting to legislate by Executive order. 
Some of our colleagues may not be aware of what we are talking about, but we have had two or three disputes--maybe we should have had more--with the administration over the last few years about executive actions that clearly should be implemented through legislation by Congress, the body elected by the people for legislative purposes. This administration, the Clinton administration, has tried to bypass Congress and legislate by Executive order. I think they have done so knowing full well in many cases they could not get their desired objective through Congress so they just decided to do it by fiat. 
I am here to say all of us, Democrats and Republicans, should reject that approach. We should uphold this institution, the legislative branch, the branch of the people, and say this is why our forefathers had separation of powers. The Constitution is very clear. If you read the Constitution, it states in article I, `All legislative powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress of the United States which shall consist of the Senate and the House of Representatives.' `All legislative powers.' It does not say some. It does not say that if the administration cannot accomplish its objectives through the Congress it can go ahead and pass them by Executive order. 
In the 10th amendment it says all other powers are reserved to the States and to the people. So the executive branch has the power to enforce the law but not to write it. That is the responsibility of the legislative branch. And then if people do not like the laws we pass, they can vote for someone else. They have a chance to do that through the election process. 
There are a couple of cases where the administration has overstepped its bounds, and I think where Congress has spoken up, or should have spoken up. One example was a case where the administration tried to give organized labor a gift and issued an Executive order to prohibit hiring replacement workers during a strike. They tried to get Congress to pass a bill that would do that in 1993 and 1994--and actually passed legislation through the House but could not get it passed through the Senate. So after the 1994 elections, the administration tried to change the law by Executive order in March 1995. That was contested in the courts. 
I might make note that in the November elections of 1994, Republicans took control of the Senate and it was obvious that this legislation could not pass Congress. So President Clinton, in my opinion, overstepped his bounds and issued an Executive order in 1995 barring management from hiring replacement workers during a strike--a perfectly legal practice under the National Labor Relations Act. He issued this order knowing that Congress had twice rejected legislation that would have done the same thing. The courts didn't let him get away with it. 
On February 2, 1996, the U.S. court of appeals threw out 
President Clinton's Executive order ruling that the President's action was clearly unlawful and was preempted by the National Labor Relations Act. Clearly, the court's message was a reminder that the President does not have a blank check to adopt policies in direct conflict with Federal laws established by Congress. 
The President does not have legislative authority. I think that is what we are finding in a couple of his other Executive actions. Another example deals with the Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument where the President in September 1996 unilaterally took a 2 million acre coal-rich block of land in Utah and made it a national monument. He did it without talking to Congress. He did it without consulting the Utah delegation. He did it without consulting the people who live and work in that area. He did it without consulting the Governor of Utah. He basically said we are going to take that 2 million acres and declare it a national monument. 
Maybe I would support such a thing, but again we have a committee, the Energy And Natural Resources Committee, that considers such bills. We should have had a hearing on that legislation. There has never been a hearing. There has never been a chance for the Utah delegation to speak out on that legislation. Is it good or not? I am not sure how I would vote. Maybe I would vote with the President. 
My point is he usurped congressional responsibility and basically said we are going to declare this a national monument by Federal fiat. 
I might mention that when he did this--it was in September 1996, during a campaign--he had a press conference around the Grand Canyon in Arizona. He did not do it at a press conference in Utah because his decision was quite unpopular. 
My point is not whether his decision is popular or not. He did it clearly for political purposes. But he did not allow the people to speak. The President is not king. He cannot do that. And maybe this will be contested. Probably we did not speak out enough on it. 
Another example where I seriously think he has exceeded his Executive authority and I think legislation is required, is the President's Executive action requiring that if you are under age 27, if you buy cigarettes, you are required to show an ID wherever you are buying them. And if retailers are found selling to minors or anybody under the age of 27, they face civil penalties of $250 or more and could be subject to other sanctions. Retailers reported to have sold cigarettes or smokeless tobacco to someone under 27, without checking their photo ID, risk compliance checks being conducted in the future. 
Maybe we should do that. I will tell my colleagues, I do not want kids smoking. I have four kids. I absolutely do not want them to smoke. This is hazardous to their health. I have a mother who has emphysema, lung cancer, which is very serious. I absolutely do not want anybody to smoke. But if the President wants to have ID checks for anybody under age 27, or age 40 for that matter, he can introduce it in Congress and maybe we can pass it. I think that is a proper prerogative of the States. But at least it should go through the legislative route. He did not do that. 
He has advocated other Executive rules dealing with advertising. I supported banning smoking on airplanes. I may support banning various types of advertising. But we should go through the legislative process. We should have hearings. We should let elected people make a decision. I think the President's Executive action goes so far as to ban outdoor billboards or baseball caps that say Marlboro, and so on. I think the President's actions and the FDA's rules have exceeded the constitutional authority of the executive branch. I think that is wrong. 
Finally, Mr. President, let me bring up the latest proposed Executive order, and I say proposed because it has been announced by the President that he is going to issue an Executive order that 
deals with Federal construction projects which will in practice screen out nonunion businesses from participating in Federal construction projects or force their employees to join a union, the so-called project labor agreements. 
Mr. President, this is an egregious power grab by organized labor. If they want to try to do this they should do it through the legislative branch. They should see if they have the votes. We have $239 billion of Federal construction spending available between now and 2002, and to come up with an Executive order and say you need not apply unless you have a union is totally wrong. Totally wrong. More than 80 percent of the workers that are doing Federal work on construction projects now, according to this proposal, need not apply; or if you are going to apply you need to join a union. What about free competition? What about competitive bidding? What about the taxpayers? 
For the administration to try to make this kind of behind-the-scenes deal with organized labor--and we have reports that organized labor was writing this regulation, that they were involved in formulating this regulation--to come up with this type of a power grab I think is absolutely wrong. If they want to do it, they should do it through the legislative branch. Have somebody who supports this legislation introduce it. Let us debate it. Let us find out where the votes are. Let us go the legislative route. Let us go the constitutional route. 
And so I have contacted the White House and tried to let them know that I am very sincere about trying to protect the constitutional prerogatives of Congress. This is the legislative body and I am very sincere about making sure that the White House does not become the legislative body by Executive action. 
And so, Mr. President, I have told the White House we are willing to use what actions we have at our disposal to try to get their attention. We have the confirmation process. We also have the appropriations process. We have the judicial process. We have other tools available to try to convince the administration they cannot legislate by Executive order. That's very much my intention. 
I just noticed an article in the Thursday, April 17th Roll Call where Mr. Reed Hunt, the Federal Communications Commission Chairman, is talking about drafting a notice of proposed rulemaking to examine the idea of free broadcast time for Federal candidates and predicted that free time for candidates could be implemented in time for the 1998 elections. 
Mr. President, we have campaign reform before this body, and there is certainly legitimate debate and we have talked about having free time for political candidates. Some people call it food stamps for politicians. That is a legitimate legislative item we should discuss. But the FCC Chairman does not have the authority to say by fiat, by direction from the administration, that we are going to give candidates free time and mandate that or dictate it or bribe the broadcasting authorities to enforce it. 
That is a serious mistake. If we are going to say politicians are entitled to free time, let us have that as part of a bill. Let us debate it. But Mr. Hunt cannot do it. 
We as a legislative body, Democrats and Republicans, need to reassert our legislative authority, our legislative responsibility, and we need to object. If we find the administration, the executive branch, trying to legislate, we need to object. At a different time I will speak about the need to object when the Supreme Court or courts are legislating as well, because we find that branch of Government is involved in the legislative process. Right now they are considering two cases legalizing assisted suicide. The Supreme Court does not have the authority to legalize anything. That is the responsibility of this body. That is called legislation. And that is a subject for a speech at another time. I am strongly opposed to the executive branch legislating as well as the judicial branch legislating. Both are wrong. This is the legislative branch. I as one Senator, whether I agree with the direction of the Executive order or the judicial decision, I am 
going to speak out loudly and strongly and use tools available to make sure the Congress remains the legislative branch of Government. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor and I thank my colleague from Connecticut for his patience.

<TEXT>
Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I rise in support of the legislation pending before us, a bill to prohibit Federal funds being used to assist in suicides. 
I wish to compliment my colleague, Senator Ashcroft, and also my colleague, Senator Dorgan, for their leadership. I am happy to cosponsor this legislation. I think it is important that we pass this legislation today. I am pleased that the House passed it overwhelmingly by a vote of 398 to 16. It is not often that we find such an overwhelming vote. 
Frankly, I can't see how anyone would vote against this legislation. This legislation makes sense. It is needed. Some may ask, `Why is it needed?" 
You might be aware of the fact that the Supreme Court held hearings earlier this year on whether or not there is a legal right for assisted suicide. I have read the Constitution many times. I don't find that right in there. That doesn't mean the Supreme Court might not, nor does it mean that some other judge might say yes, you have a constitutional right for assisted suicide, and someone else say yes, that is a constitutional right; therefore, it should be covered by Medicare or Medicaid, and, therefore, be paid for by the Federal Government. 
So maybe this is a preemptive strike. It is unfortunate to think it might even be needed. But it is needed. We want to make sure it doesn't happen. We want to make sure that we don't have more Dr. Kevorkians running around the country saying, `You have a legal right to kill yourself, and therefore, we will help you; and, oh, yes, we want the taxpayers to pay for it.' We don't want the taxpayers to pay for it. We want to send a signal to Dr. Kevorkian that we don't agree with him. 
Dr. Kevorkian made a statement which was reported in the New York Times on April 5 talking about the fact that he publicly burned a cease and desist order from the State. He said, `If you want to stop something, pass a law.' 
That is what we are trying to do today. We are trying to make it very clear that the Congress of the United States overwhelmingly believes that you should not use Federal funds to assist in something like suicides, something that is as deadly as suicide. 
This would clarify the law. If assisted suicide is legalized by the Supreme Court, or in any individual State, all it would take is one district court judge to rule that assisted suicide fits under the Medicare statute's guidelines. On January 8, 1997, the Supreme Court heard oral arguments in two cases in which the Federal courts of appeals have declared a constitutional right to assisted suicide. 
Mr. President I think we want to send a very clear signal. I might mention that this Congress has already passed a ban. In 1995, I offered legislation banning the use of Medicaid and Medicare funds for assisted suicide in the balanced budget amendment which passed this Congress. Unfortunately, President Clinton vetoed the legislation. But he didn't veto the legislation because of this. 
An amicus brief, filed by the American Medical Association, to the Supreme Court on November 12, 1996, contends that assisted suicide `will create profound danger for many ill persons with undiagnosed depression and inadequately treated pain for whom assisted suicide rather than good palliative care could become the norm. At greatest risk would be those with the least access to palliative care--the poor, the elderly, and members of minority groups.' 
Acting Solicitor Gen. Walter Dellinger recently said in opposing the idea of a right to assisted suicide, `The systemic dangers are dramatic . . . the least costly treatment for any 
illness is lethal medication.' That is reported in the New York Times on January 9 of this year. 
We are a nation built on the principle that human life is sacred, to be honored and cherished. As public servants, we deal with issues that affect the lives of people every day. Caring for people is the underlying aspect of nearly every piece of legislation dealt with in this Senate. 
Dr. Joanne Lynn, board member of the American Geriatrics Society, and director of the Center to Improve Care of the Dying at George Washington University, said, `No one needs to be alone or in pain or beg a doctor to put an end to misery. Good care is possible.' 
Cardinal Joseph Bernardin, while dying last November, took the time to write the Supreme Court on assisted suicide, saying, 
There can be no such thing as a `right to assisted suicide' because there can be no legal and moral order which tolerates the killing of innocent human life, even if the agent of death is self-administered. Creating a new `right' to assisted suicide will endanger society and send a false signal that a less than `perfect' life is not worth living. 
There are a lot of groups and a lot of individuals who have endorsed this legislation. 
The American Medical Association said, 
The power to assist in intentionally taking the life of a patient is antithetical to the central mission of healing that guides physicians. The AMA continues to stand by its ethical principle that physician-assisted suicide is fundamentally incompatible with the physician's role as healer and that physicians must instead aggressively respond to the needs of patients at the end of life. 
That was signed by John Seward, executive vice president of the AMA, on April 15. 
Mr. President, this legislation is endorsed by not only the American Medical Association but also the National Conference of Catholic Bishops, American Academy of Hospice and Palliative Medicine, American Geriatrics Society, Christian Coalition, Family Research Council, Free Congress, National Right to Life, Physicians for Compassionate Care, and the Traditional Values Coalition.

Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, again, I wish to thank sponsors of this legislation. I have had the pleasure of working with both Senators from Missouri. Both Senators made outstanding statements in support of this legislation. In addition, Senator Dorgan--we appreciate his support for this legislation. It has bipartisan support. We have a lot of cosponsors on both sides of the aisle. 
It is my hope that the Senate will pass the identical bill that the House passed and that we will send it to the President. 
Also, I have a statement from the administration. The Clinton administration issued a statement of administration policy on April 10, 1997, which states, `The President made it clear that he does not support assisted suicide. The administration, therefore, does not oppose enactment of H.R. 1003.' 
Mr. President, there is no reason for us to amend this legislation. There is no reason for us to delay this legislation. Let's pass this legislation and send a message to Dr. Kevorkian and others that Federal funding will not be tolerated and that it will not be legal to assist in assisted suicide. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. NICKLES. Madam President, first, I wish to compliment and congratulate my colleague from Minnesota for an outstanding statement on really the need for tax relief. Today is tax day. Today is the day that thousands of Americans will be running to the post office trying to make sure they get their taxes filed on time. 
In my household, it is not a pleasant time. My wife and I have been married 28-plus years, and this is always the time where we are scrambling around to make sure we find all the charitable contributions, make sure we get all the 1099's, make sure we get all the forms together, and it is not pleasant, it is not easy, it is not something we look forward to. 
I heard my friend and colleague from Arkansas say he does not mind one bit the amount of money he pays in taxes. I will say, as a taxpayer, I mind. I will say a lot of taxes are unfair and a lot of taxes are very counterproductive to individual freedom. As a matter of fact, a lot of taxes actually suffocate an individual's ability to expand, to grow, to work for yourself, to take care of your family. 
I will give you a couple of examples and one of the reasons why this Senator favors very much balancing the budget but also, likewise, cutting taxes for families, particularly working families, making some changes in estate taxes as outlined by my colleague, Senator Grams, and making some changes in capital gains. Let's touch on a couple of examples. 
I heard my colleague from Arkansas say, `Well, they're cutting taxes for the wealthy.' You do not have to be very wealthy, and all of a sudden you are working for the Government more than you are working for yourself. If you are a self-employed individual and you have a company, maybe you have a painting service or lawn service--I used to have a janitor service when I was in college--if you are self-employed, single, and you have taxable income at $25,000, most people would not categorize you as rich. But according to Government sources, you must be, because the Government wants half of everything you make. 
If a person has a taxable income at $25,000, their marginal income tax bracket is 28 percent Federal income tax. That individual must also pay Social Security taxes; if self-employed, he pays 15.3 percent. Add that to the 28, and that is 43.3 percent, and that is before they pay any State income tax. In my State that is 
about 7 percent. 
That means that person, that individual with taxable income of $25,000 pays 28 percent Federal income tax, 15.3 percent FICA tax, unemployment tax, Social Security, Medicare tax. You add the two together and get 43.3, add State income tax and, bingo, that person is taxed at over 50 percent, and any additional dollar they make is going to Government. 
I think that is too high. I do not think Government is entitled to take over half of what they make. They are the ones creating the work. They are the ones doing the job. They are the ones putting in the labor, the sweat, the equity, the homework, the education necessary to create the job, create the service, and Government is coming in saying they want half of it. If it is a couple and their taxable income is $40,000, they are in the same 50-percent tax bracket. 
I think that is too high. I think estate taxes are high. My colleague said that is cutting taxes for the wealthy. You can have a taxable estate of $1 million, and Uncle Sam says they want 39 percent. Why in the world, if a person accumulates a couple of restaurants, maybe two or three restaurants, and they happen to have an estate value of $1.6 million--we have a $600,000 exemption, so he has two or three restaurants and their value is worth, say, $2 million, why should Uncle Sam say it wants 40 percent of it? What did Uncle Sam do to generate those businesses? Why should it be entitled to 40 percent? 
Or if you have a taxable estate of $3 million, Uncle Sam wants 55 percent of that estate. Again, it could be a farm, ranch, machine job, it could be a restaurant, it could be any type of business. Why should the Government come in and say, `We want over half'? What did Government do to create those jobs, that business? I disagree. 
That tax is unfair. It needs to be changed. I think it is counterproductive. I do not think it raises money. 
I think when you get into marginal rates, over half of the people find ways to avoid taxes. They will come up with schemes. They will come up with scams. They will do different scams. They do not want the Government to get over half of what they make. They work to get it down. 
We should change rates. When we change rates, my colleague from Minnesota mentioned, when we lower that tax on transactions, there are more transactions, and the Government makes more money. A lot of people are sitting on a lot of transactions. They would like to sell this land for that, and buy this land, or sell this stock and buy that stock, but they do not want to if Uncle Sam says, `We want 28 percent for that exchange.' If you reduce the tax on that exchange, capital gains, you will have a lot more trading, a lot more buying and selling, and Government will make money on the transactions. The Government does not make money if people sit on the assets and do not trade the assets. 
The point is, we can reduce the rates and generate more money for the Federal Government, and, I think, create a healthier, more stable economy. 
So, Madam President, I make this statement urging my colleagues that this is the year that we can balance the budget and provide tax relief for American families. It should be a done deal. President Clinton campaigned for tax relief in 1992. He did not deliver. Actually he delivered just the opposite. In 1993, he passed the largest tax increase in history. In 1996, President Clinton campaigned for tax relief. Bob Dole, the Republican candidate, campaigned for tax relief. Both said they favored a $500-tax-credit per child. You would think that would be a done deal. We passed that last year in the last Congress. President Clinton, unfortunately, vetoed it. You think it would be a done deal and now it would happen. I am not so sure everybody on the other side is willing to do that. Hopefully the President will. 
I want to work with the President. I want it to become law. I do not have an interest in passing a tax bill just to have it vetoed. I want to pass a tax relief package this year that includes relief for American working families, that includes a reduction in capital gains, that includes estate tax relief, that includes incentives to save, IRAs, saving for retirement and education, I want to pass that and have it become law. 
We look forward to working with the President and other Members in this body to pass a bipartisan package that can actually reduce taxpayers' taxes this year. 
Madam President, I ask unanimous consent for an additional 5 minutes.

Mr. NICKLES. Madam President, Attorney General Janet Reno's refusal to appoint an independent counsel to investigate the Clinton administration's highly questionable fundraising activities is based upon a shocking misinterpretation of the history, purpose, and requirements of the independent counsel law. 
Ms. Reno states that the act `does not permit' invoking the independent counsel provisions unless there is `specific and credible evidence that a crime may have been committed by' a person covered by the law. In fact, the law requires that it be invoked whenever there is `information sufficient to constitute grounds to investigate' whether any person covered by the law may have violated Federal law. In short, even though General Reno acknowledges that there are `sufficient grounds to investigate,' and even though that investigation is ongoing as I speak, she insists on controlling the investigation herself. 
There remains no conceivable room for doubt that the Clinton administration, the Clinton-Gore campaign, and the Democratic National Committee engaged in fundraising practices that must be investigated. Virtually every editorial page in the Nation, from the Wall Street Journal to the New York Times, have demanded an investigation. Indeed, even the highest officials at the DNC have acknowledged that their practices were questionable and have agreed to return over $3 million in contributions from foreign nationals, persons who gave contributions in the names of others, and contributions that may have come from foreign governments. And serious questions exist as to the use of Government property to solicit contributions and reward contributors. 
The Vice President has admitted that he made numerous telephone calls from his official office using a Clinton-Gore campaign card to raise funds for the purpose of furthering the Clinton-Gore reelection campaign. Several of the recipients of those calls said that they felt pressured to contribute because they had ongoing business with the Government. Other telephone call recipients perceived these calls as constituting a shakedown. When a charge was recently aired that a prominent Member of Congress had pressured a potential contributor, a Federal grand jury investigation was launched within days of the allegation. Shouldn't the Vice President, or the President, who had pointedly not denied making fundraising calls from his office, be investigated as well? 
The purpose of the independent counsel law is to entrust the investigation of these matters to someone who is not a subordinate of the official or officials being investigated. Yet General Reno refuses to invoke the independent counsel law until she is satisfied that laws have, in fact, been broken. That decision is not hers to make. That interpretation stands the law on its head. 
It is impossible to defend the proposition, as the Attorney General attempts to do, that covered persons are not implicated in the investigation that she is presently conducting and which should be conducted by an independent person. Documents released by the White House prove conclusively that the fundraising by the President's reelection campaign and by the DNC was run, on a day-to-day, hands-on basis by the President, himself, and his direct subordinate, Deputy Chief of Staff Harold Ickes. The DNC took orders directly from the President through Mr. Ickes. And the President and the Vice President and the First Lady were directly and substantially involved in all fundraising activities by the Clinton-Gore campaign and by the DNC, which was raising not soft money, but money that was raised for the purpose and used directly to fuel the President's reelection drive. 
The Attorney General seems to feel that some of the laws implicated by these practices may not or should not be prosecuted. But that prosecutorial decision must not be made by someone who owes her position in Government to the official who may have possibly violated those laws. It does not answer this concern for the Attorney General to state that she is relying on career officials in the Department of Justice. As long as they are reporting to her, they are reporting to the President. She may not independently investigate the conduct of President Clinton any more than Attorney General Mitchell could investigate President Nixon or Attorney General Meese could investigate President Reagan. 
I am not prejudging the results of the investigation which must be conducted into these matters. But I know that the practices that must be investigated may have violated Federal criminal laws, and that those violations may have been encouraged, inspired, directed, or condoned by the President or his immediate subordinates. The people of the United States are entitled to a prompt, full, fair, and independent investigation of these matters, and that investigation cannot be controlled by a person who serves at the pleasure of the President.

Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, today, I am introducing legislation with my colleague from Louisiana, Senator Breaux, to address the ever-recurring problem of Federal mandates on small business. Our bill will prohibit the Internal Revenue Service from forcing thousands of small businesses to deposit payroll taxes by electronic funds transfer under threat of penalty. In addition to Senator Breaux, I would like to thank several other Senators who have agreed to cosponsor this legislation, including Senator Mack, Senator Baucus, Senator D'Amato, Senator Bond, Senator DeWine, Senator Cochran, and Senator Enzi. 
Legislation enacted in 1993 to implement the North American Free-Trade Agreement directed the IRS to begin collecting a progressively larger percentage of payroll tax deposits from employers by electronic funds transfer, in lieu of the Federal tax deposit coupon system. Congress' intent was to simplify the tax deposit system and reduce paperwork for taxpayers, financial institutions, and the IRS. The Senate report accompanying this bill recommended that the implementation of this mandate not create hardships for small businesses, and that no small business should be required to purchase computers or gain access to any electronic equipment other than a touch-tone telephone. Further, the report urged Treasury to take into account the specific needs of small employers, including possible exemption for the very smallest businesses from the electronic deposit system. 
Unfortunately, the IRS has done little to mitigate the impact on small business. Instead, they sent notices to 1.2 million small businesses last summer stating that they must begin using the new electronic Federal tax payment System, or EFTPS, to make payroll tax deposits on January 1, 1997. Further, the IRS told these taxpayers that continued use of the Federal tax deposit coupon system would result in penalties equal to 10 percent of each deposit. The IRS targeted this mandate on any business which deposited more than $50,000 in payroll taxes in 1995. Prior to this time, the threshold for mandatory electronic deposits was $47 million. If the IRS is not stopped, Mr. President, the threshold will drop to $20,000 next year. 
The reaction from the small business community to this mandate last year was adverse and vocal, Mr. President. Fortunately, Congress acted to delay the EFTPS mandate until July 1, 1997. However, that date is quickly approaching, and thousands of small business owners are no more comfortable with the mandate now than they were last year. Business owners who have used the coupon system for years to diligently pay their taxes on time are incensed to learn that they can be forced from that system against their will. Some fear IRS access to their bank accounts, and others fear the additional costs which may arise if their bank begins charging fees for these transactions. Finally, many small businesses are discovering that their current bank does not participate fully in the electronic transaction system. 
Mr. President, small business owners should not have a new tax deposit system forced down their throats without alternatives and without enough time or information to make an orderly transition to the new system. Further, they should not be forced to incur fees or other additional costs in order to pay their taxes. While I agree that many taxpayers will come to prefer an electronic deposit system, I do not believe such a change should be mandated under threat of penalty. If a small business prefers to use the coupon system and continues to pay their taxes on time, they should not be penalized for doing so. 
Mr. President, the legislation Senator Breaux and I are introducing today will phase in the requirement to pay depository taxes electronically in manageable increments and exempt most small businesses permanently. Under our bill, only businesses who annually deposit over $5 million in payroll taxes will ever be mandated to use the electronic deposit system. Further, the bill directs the Secretary of the Treasury to establish a program to encourage all business taxpayers to voluntarily participate in the electronic deposit system. 
Enactment of this legislation will free small business owners from yet another heavyhanded Federal mandate and preserve their right to pay their taxes in a manner which best suits their business needs. I encourage all Senators to join in this effort. 
Mr. President, again I wish to thank the Presiding Officer of the Senate at this time, the Senator from Wyoming, for cosponsoring this legislation. I also ask unanimous consent that Senator Hagel be added as an original cosponsor.

Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, to summarize again for the benefit of my colleagues, effective July 1, if we do not change this current--I started to say `law,' but this is not a law. The IRS came up with a regulation. We passed a law. Congress passed a law that says we want to encourage electronic fund transfers of payroll taxes. A good idea. It makes sense. It will work for a lot of people. 
IRS, to implement this, and maybe with some direction of Congress--Congress said put most of the taxpayers in. The IRS did so, and then they came up with a 10-percent penalty. That is a big inducement, encouragement. Congress did not put on the 10-percent penalty; the IRS did--it puts a gun to the taxpayer's head--and then said, `You have to do this.' Then they said, `This is not too much of a challenge for bigger employers.' As a matter of fact, the current requirement, the threshold is $47 million of payroll taxes. If you have payroll taxes of $47 million, that is a big operation. And they are doing that now. That actually applies to 1,500 taxpayers in the country today. 
The next threshold level drops from $47 million to $50,000. Now you are talking about a lot of companies. You are talking about a lot of businesses. You do not have to be very big to have payroll taxes of $50,000. You might have total payroll of a quarter of a million or $300,000. That deadline is July 1. It was to be January 1. We postponed it for 6 months. 
The legislation we have introduced today, it phases down the $47 million threshold to $30 million, to $10 million, to $5 million, and says, `If you have payroll taxes of less than $5 million, you do not have to do this. You can still do it, you still have the option to do it.' 
I met with some representatives from the IRS. They said, `We are concerned, if we pass this legislation, a lot of people might not get into the system. Maybe that would not be fair for the people already in the system.' 
I said I want them to have the option. In our legislation, we want to encourage people to move into the electronic fund transfer. We think that would be good. A lot of people pay their home notes--I do that. When I pay my home mortgage, I do it by electronic fund transfer where you used to have the coupon system. I am happy with that. I think a lot of taxpayers will be happy paying payroll taxes this way, and we want this to be an option. 
We want to eliminate the 10-percent penalty for noncompliance, especially for small business. 
So that is what we have done. I ask unanimous consent Senator Thomas also be included as an original cosponsor.

Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the HIV Prevention Act of 1997. This legislation appropriately refocuses public health efforts on HIV prevention by using proven public health techniques designed for communicable diseases. The public health initiatives in this bill, which result in early detection of HIV infection, are now more important than ever in light of the tremendous advances that medical science has made. 
This bill will balance the needs of HIV-infected patients with the prevention needs of those who are uninfected. The HIV Prevention Act of 1997 establishes a confidential, national HIV reporting effort as already exists for end stage HIV and AIDS; requires partner notification; mandates testing for indicted sexual offenders; protects health care patients and professionals from inadvertent exposure to HIV; provides access to insurance-required HIV test results; and allows adoptive parents to learn the HIV status of a child. In addition, this legislation includes Sense of the Senate language which expresses that the States should criminalize the intentional transmission of HIV; and also expresses the Sense of the Senate that strict confidentiality must be observed at all times in carrying out all of the provisions of the act. 
The Senate is on record supporting the provisions of this bill in a 1990 amendment which was adopted by voice vote. The primary sponsors of the amendment were Senators Kennedy and Mikulski. During debate on the amendment, Senator Kennedy argued, `In a case in which there is a clear and present danger, there is a duty to warn.' That is the purpose of the HIV Prevention Act of 1997. The best ways to warn for the prevention of further spread of HIV and AIDS are reporting and partner notification, methods which are currently in use and proven to be effective. 
This bill has received overwhelming support from groups including the Independent Women's Forum, Americans for a Sound AIDS/HIV Policy, the Family Research Council, Women Against Violence, the Christian Coalition, and the American Medical Association. I quote from a letter written by the AMA in support of this legislation: 
`These public health initiatives which result in early detection of HIV infection are now more important because of the tremendous advances that medical science has made. Early intervention combined with effective treatments will enable those with HIV and AIDS to live longer, healthier lives.' 
The HIV Prevention Act adds HIV to 52 other notifiable contagious diseases such as gonorrhea, hepatitis A, B, and C, syphilis, tuberculosis, and AIDS that must be reported to the Centers for Disease Control. In terms of partner notification, 26 states, including, I might add, Oklahoma, already require notification. It is time that these policies that are already in practice in some states are applied around the country in order to track and prevent further spread of HIV. 
Mr. President, this legislation will greatly increase public health HIV prevention efforts that until now have focused only on AIDS. The HIV Prevention Act of 1997 is a sensible, common sense approach toward containing the spread of AIDS. By using proven, public health techniques and sound medical practices, this bill will curtail the spread of HIV. I thank the chair and encourage my colleagues to support this commonsense legislation.

Mr. NICKLES. I will just make a couple brief comments concerning campaign finance. 
One, I share some of the concerns of my colleague from Illinois. I will be happy to work with him. I did object to the resolution saying we wanted to have it done by May 31 or July 4. But I am committed to making campaign reform. And I will work with my colleague and friend from Illinois and others to try and see if we cannot come up with a bipartisan package that would do just that. 
It may not include everything that everybody has been talking about, but it will be constitutional, and, hopefully, may be passable through both Houses. It may not include everything. We may have to pass a couple pieces of legislation before we are done. But I have been charged with the responsibility on this side to try to put together a package that is saleable. I will work with my colleague and friend from Illinois to try to make that happen.

Mr. NICKLES. I will be happy to tell my colleague, if you are asking me what the effective date of the legislation will be, I am not sure. But I do think that we have an interest, and I would say a bipartisan interest, in trying to do some things together: Greater disclosure, trying to make sure that nobody is forced or compelled to contribute to any campaign against their will, maybe making some change in contribution limits, increasing individual limits, maybe reducing other limits. Possibly we can get a bipartisan coalition on that, and doing a few other things that we might be able to get agreement on. 
But the effective date, well, that would be one of the things we will have to wrestle with. That is a challenge. Some of those things for disclosure, I expect could be effective certainly for the 1998 election. If you changed individual contributions, which I am contemplating offering as one suggestion, whether that should be effective immediately or effective post the 1998 election is something we will have to discuss.

It is my hope and expectation that we will be ready to do that--not tie this down to a particular timetable--but I hope that we will be able to do it in the not-too-distant future. Maybe we will be able to meet the timeframe as suggested by my colleague from Illinois. I am not ready to give a date. But you are saying for this year. I hope that will be the case.

Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I wish to thank my colleague and friend, Senator Leahy, for his cooperation in bringing this bill to the floor. As I mentioned, the House passed this bill yesterday. It was by a vote of 418 to 9. 
I also want to thank my colleagues, Senator Hatch, Senator Inhofe--who is an original cosponsor of this legislation with me--Senator Grassley and Senator Kennedy and their staffs for working together with our staff to make this bill possible. 
And I want to thank the bipartisan and bicameral cooperation that we have had because we have negotiated with the House, came up with similar legislation to correct, I think, a mistake, a problem. 
Mr. President, we introduce this legislation on behalf of the victims of the Oklahoma City bombing and other victims of crime. This legislation will clarify the rights of victims to attend and observe the trial of the accused and also testify at the sentencing hearing. 
The Victim Rights Clarification Act is necessary because a Federal judge interpreted his sequestration power as authorizing the exclusion of victims of crime from trial who will only be witnesses at sentencing. The district judge presiding over the Oklahoma City bombing case basically gave the victims and their families two choices. They could attend the trial and witness the trial--or in this case we have closed-circuit TV for the families, since the trial is actually in Denver and many of the families are in Oklahoma City. So they have closed-circuit TV. They have two options: They can view the trial in Denver or in Oklahoma City, or they could participate in the sentencing phase of the trial. 
Most of the families of the victims wanted to do both--or many wanted to do both. They should not have had to make that decision. This legislation will clarify that. 
Such rulings as the judge made extend sequestration far beyond what Congress has intended. The accused has no legitimate basis for excluding a victim who will not testify during the trial. Congress thought it already adopted a provision precluding such sequestration in the victims' bill of rights. This bill clarifies the preexisting law so it is indisputable that district courts cannot deny victims and surviving family members the opportunity to watch the trial merely because they will provide information during the sentencing phase of the proceedings. 
This bill also applies to all pending cases and in no way singles out a case for unique or special treatment. Rather, a serious problem has come to light and Congress has responded by clarifying the applicable Federal law across the country from this day forward.

Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I thank my friend and colleague, Senator Leahy from Vermont. We have done something rather unusual. We worked together in a very bipartisan fashion to do some good work, and we did it very quickly. It is not often that Congress passes legislation this quickly, and we did so. 
Also, I want to thank Senator Daschle and Senator Lott because we wanted to expedite this. We would like to get it to the President before he leaves the country today. This trial happens to start on the 31st of this month. 
I might mention that this is the third piece of legislation that we have passed that deals directly, or has had some impact, I guess, as a result of the Oklahoma City bombing. Last Congress, we passed legislation dealing with habeas corpus reform, one of the most significant improvements, I think, in our statutes dealing with criminal law in a long time. We wanted to have an end to endless appeals. I think the Oklahoma City tragedy gave us great momentum to make that happen. I remember several of the victims coming to testify, urging Congress to enact a crime bill, but also urging Congress to enact habeas reform because they wanted to see justice soon rather than later. 
We also passed legislation to allow closed-circuit TV so victims would not have to go all the way to Denver. I was disappointed the decision was made that the trial would be held in Denver. Originally, the judge said the people would have to attend to witness the trial. This trial could last for months. We passed legislation basically mandating that closed-circuit TV would be allowed in this case and, hopefully, other cases. Hopefully, we will not have other cases, but if we have another case that might be identical to this, the victims and their families would not have to travel several hundred miles just to be able to witness the trial. 
Finally, we passed this legislation, this important legislation, to allow victims and their families to be able to witness a trial and also, if they desire, to be able to testify during the sentencing phase. This would not have happened if we did not have bipartisan support. 
Again, I thank my colleagues for making it happen. I am delighted. On behalf of hundreds of Oklahoma City families who are directly impacted, we say thank you to both our colleagues in the House and the Senate for passing this legislation today. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I have always believed that economic freedom is a critical part of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. Unfortunately, the Internal Revenue Code does not always promote or encourage economic freedom, and one area where this is strikingly clear is the confiscatory, anti-family, anti-growth estate tax. 
Most Americans work diligently throughout their lives to provide for their families and give their children and grandchildren a better future. This work often results in the accumulation of assets like homes, businesses, and farms; all acquired with hard work and bought with after-tax dollars. Unfortunately, those without high-paid lawyers and accountants realize too late that up to 55 percent of those assets could be confiscated by the Federal Government upon their death. 
Some people mistakenly believe estate taxes only affect the rich, but there are thousands of small businesses and farms throughout the country owned and operated by middle-income Americans that are affected by existing estate tax laws. These small businesses may appear to be economically significant on paper, but often they have little liquid assets to cover estate tax liabilities. Historically, these businesses have created most of the new jobs in this country and fueled the growth of the economy. 
The unfortunate result of high estate taxes is that families are frequently forced to sell off part of the family business to pay the taxes incurred by the deceased family member's estate. This liquidation of productive assets to finance tax liabilities is anti-family and anti-business. At the very least, families and businesses are forced to employ an army of expensive experts to avoid the worst estate taxes, a make-work exercise that exacerbates the inefficiency of the system. 
Mr. President, I believe it is patently unfair for the Federal Government to assume that it has the right to take an individual's hard-earned assets and redistribute them to others. If our goal as a society and a government is to encourage long-term, private savings and investment we cannot continue the policy of confiscating estates. With an average savings rate in the United States of 2.9 percent, which is lower than that of any other industrialized country, we should be encouraging individuals, families, and businesses to save and invest. 
Since 1987, a unified tax credit for gifts and estate transfers has effectively exempted $600,000 worth of assets from estate taxes. This basic exemption has increased modestly over the years, from $60,000 in the 1940's, 1950's and 1960's to $225,000 in 1982. Unfortunately, the current estate exemption of $600,000 has been greatly eroded by inflation. 
The legislation I am introducing today with the Senate majority leader, Senator Grassley, Senator Breaux, Senator Baucus, and others addresses the problems associated with the estate tax in a thoughtful, bipartisan manner. It is not the perfect solution to these problems, Mr. President, but it is a good first step. I believe that ultimately we must radically restructure the estate tax by reducing marginal rates, which now exceed 55 percent for estates larger than $3 million, and I believe we must strive to treat all types of family businesses equally. However, I recognize the budget constraints Congress is working under, and I believe it is important to move forward in a bipartisan manner. 
The legislation we are introducing today increases the estate tax exemption from $600,000 to $1,000,000, thus allowing more homeowners, farmers, and small businesses to keep their hard-earned wealth. Further, our bill would provide special relief for closely-held family businesses. We would allow estate-tax free transfers of up to $1.5 million in small business assets to qualified family members, and a 50 percent exclusion for up to $8.5 million in assets above that threshold, as long as the heirs continue to operate the business. 
The legislation we are introducing today makes simple pro-family, pro-business, and pro-economy changes to our tax code. It will allow more homeowners, farmers, and small businesses to keep their hard-earned wealth. I encourage my colleagues to join us as cosponsors of this bill.

Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my friend and colleague from Missouri, Senator Bond, in the introduction of the Home-Based Business Fairness Act. I compliment Senator Bond for his leadership on these issues and all matters affecting small business as chairman of the Senate Committee on Small Business. 
The small, independent business is the engine which drives innovation, job creation, and increased economic activity in this country. I am proud to live in a country where any person can use talent, intelligence, and hard work to start a business. I believe these businesses are the foundation of our free enterprise economy, and the very essence of capitalism. 
There are 5 million independent contractors in America according to the Small Business Administration, and almost one-third of all companies use independent contractors to some degree. Further, the SBA estimates that more than 14 million individuals earn some income from home-based businesses, and some 300,000 women start home-based businesses every year. 
Unfortunately, Mr. President, the Internal Revenue Code does not always treat small businesses fairly, and it often acts to limit and repress the entrepreneurial spirit. The legislation we are introducing today is intended to address some of the Tax Code's inequities and remove the roadblocks to the creation of new small businesses. 
A perfect example of the Tax Code's bias against small business is the treatment of health insurance expenses. Corporations can currently deduct 100 percent of the health insurance costs of their employees. As recently as 2 years ago, self-employed individuals were only allowed to deduct 25 percent of their health insurance costs. Fortunately, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 increased this limit to 40 percent this year, with a scheduled increase to 80 percent by 2006. However, the bias against small business continues. Our legislation increases the deduction for health insurance cost for self-employed individuals to 100 percent beginning on January 1, 1997. 
For some small business taxpayers, the enemy has not been the IRS or the Congress, but the judiciary. A 1993 Supreme Court decision, Commissioner versus Soliman has been interpreted to require two new tests for the home-office deduction: First, the customers of a home business must physically visit the home office, and second, the taxpayer's business income must be generated within the home office itself--not from transactions that occur outside of the home office. This interpretation has effectively prevented millions of taxpayers from deducting valid, reasonable, and necessary business expenses. The Home-Based Business Fairness Act will permit taxpayers who perform their services outside the home but use their home office for essential billing and recordkeeping to qualify for the home-office deduction, provided they perform these activities on a regular, ongoing, and nonincidental basis in the home office and have no other location at which to perform these business activities. This section of the bill will be effective on January 1, 1997. 
Finally, Mr. President, our legislation addresses a major, continuing problem for the small business community. The problem is worker classification--independent contractor or employee. In a perfect world, this issue should be irrelevant. The relationship between a worker and a business would be strictly based on their individual needs, and the Government's only interest would be to collect the same amount of taxes regardless of the relationship. 
Unfortunately, however, this is not a perfect world. The complexity of the Tax Code and Congress' failure to provide adequate guidance to small businesses and their workers has resulted in a confusing mess. Left to their own devices, the Internal Revenue Service has adopted an aggressive, proemployee agenda. 
For the last 20 years, the classification of workers as contractors or employees has been controlled by a 20-factor common law test which attempts to define a business' control over a worker. This common law test is the bane of employers and workers across the country. The General Accounting Office has called the common law test unclear and 
subject to conflicting interpretations. Even the Treasury Department has testified that: 
Applying the common law test in employment tax issues does not yield clear, consistent, or even satisfactory answers, and reasonable persons may differ as to the correct classification. 
Beyond the 20-factor test, some businesses may avail themselves of a safe harbor enacted in 1978. The section 530 safe harbor prohibits the IRS from reclassifying workers as employees if the business had a reasonable basis for treatment of the workers as independent contractors, or if a past IRS audit did not dispute the workers' classification. 
Our bill creates a new worker classification safe harbor and provides limited relief from retroactive worker reclassification, two changes which will resolve many of the problems small businesses face with the IRS. Our bill does not repeal the 20-factor common law test, it does not repeal the section 530 safe harbor, and it does not affect other special worker classification situations such as statutory employees or direct sellers. Put simply, our bill will benefit those businesses and contractors who have not resolved their status with the IRS, while preserving current law for those who are satisfied with it. 
To summarize briefly, our legislation protects businesses and contractors who meet one of two tests. The first test measures a worker's economic risk and workplace independence, and requires the two parties to have a written contract and comply with all tax reporting requirements. Under the second test, a worker who conducts business through a corporation or a limited liability company, does not receive benefits from the service recipient, and has a written contract will be treated as an independent contractor. 
Our bill also protects businesses from retroactive reclassification of workers and the associated liability for back taxes, interest, and penalties, provided the business had a written contract with the workers, complied with all tax reporting requirements, and had a reasonable basis to treat the workers as contractors. Finally, our legislation repeals section 1706 of the Tax Reform Act of 1986 which precludes third-party technical service workers from the section 530 safe harbor, and it clarifies that compliance with a statutory or regulatory requirements will not be treated as evidence of control for the purpose of worker classification. 
Mr. President, the Tax Code reforms included in the Home-Based Business Fairness Act are commonsense solutions to the real problems faced by small businesses. With this bill, Senator Bond and I have tried to address those problems which we believe are most critical to the creation of new small businesses, new jobs, and new economic growth. I encourage my colleagues to give this legislation their thoughtful consideration and join us in this initiative.

Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, today, following morning business, at 11:30, the Senate will resume consideration of Senate Joint Resolution 18, the Hollings resolution regarding the constitutional amendment on campaign funding. That debate will continue until 12:30 today, at which time the Senate will recess until the hour of 2:15 for the weekly policy conferences to meet. 
When the Senate reconvenes at 2:15, there will be an additional 30 minutes for closing remarks, followed by a rollcall vote on passage of Senate Joint Resolution 18. Therefore, Senators can anticipate the rollcall vote at approximately 2:45 today. 
Following that vote, the Senate will resume consideration of Senate Joint Resolution 22, the independent counsel resolution. We will be continuing discussions with the Democratic leader in the hope of reaching a consent agreement to allow us to complete action on this resolution. Also this week, it is possible that the Senate will consider a resolution regarding Mexico and their certification in the antidrug effort. In addition, the Senate may begin consideration of the nuclear waste legislation prior to our adjournment for the Easter recess. 
Again, I remind my colleagues that since this is the last week of session prior to the adjournment, I hope all Senators will continue to cooperate and adjust schedules accordingly as we attempt to schedule legislation and votes. I thank my colleagues.

Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I rise today to support the resolution of Senator Lott calling for the Attorney General to appoint an independent counsel to investigate many of the allegations of illegal activity concerning the 1996 election cycle. 
This statement--I will read most of it--is very serious. It bothers me as a Senator to do this. I am not a big proponent of the independent counsel statute, but I think clearly it was written to avoid a conflict of interest between the Attorney General and covered persons, those persons being the President, the Vice President, and heads of national committees. I think we have seen evidence in the last 2 or 3 months that there probably is a conflict of interest between the Attorney General and the President and the Vice President and other high officials within the Clinton administration. 
In the New York Times there is an editorial that says: Disclosures about a Chinese plan to influence the election have taken the fund raising scandal to a new level of seriousness and clarity. Now it is clear that any citizen with a reasonable interest in the efficiency of the Federal investigative agencies and the integrity of the electoral process will want a full account of what went on. 
I agree with that. 
Recent news reports revealed conflicting accounts by President Clinton, the White House, and the FBI, concerning whether the President was made aware of intelligence information that the Chinese Government might be trying to influence the upcoming elections. The FBI believe they may attempt to funnel illegal donations into Presidential and congressional campaigns. The question whether the President was aware of this information and if not, why it was kept from the President, is just one of the numerous conflicts of interest pending before the Attorney General. 
It is an important issue to determine whether President Clinton was aware of the Chinese Government's intended illegal actions before he approved White House coffees, lunches, and dinners with individuals known to have close ties to the Chinese Government. Charlie Trie, Pauline Kanchanalak, and Johnny Chung were allowed frequent access into the White House to attend various functions and one-on-one meetings with the President. 
Mr. Chung came into the White House reportedly 49 times--and I have heard 51 times--and he donated over $366,000 that had to be returned. One of Mr. Chung's visits came only 1 day after he delivered a $50,000 check to Mrs. Clinton's Chief of Staff Maggie Williams in the White House. Mr. Chung brought six Chinese businessmen into the Oval Office to watch the President's radio address, one of which is the vice president of a Chinese company that trades weapons. They had their photos taken afterward. The White House was warned about handing over these pictures by the President's own NSC staff. They labeled Mr. Chung a `hustler' and warned that he might use the pictures to `enhance his business.' In spite of this, Mr. Chung also brought Chinese beer executives into the White House who evidently obtained their pictures with the President since it was reported that one of these pictures was featured on a billboard advertisement for the beer company. 
Pauline Kanchanalak visited the White House at least 26 times and donated approximately $250,000 to the DNC. On the day Ms. Kanchanalak brought some of her business clients to a White House coffee with the President, she donated $85,000 to the DNC and it was recorded that the donation was for `coffee with the President of the United States.' Ms. Kanchanalak has not been available to answer questions about any of this. She apparently left the country after congressional subpoenas were issued and there were news reports that documents were destroyed. 
Charlie Trie visited the White House up to 37 times and delivered $640,000 in checks and money orders to the President's legal defense fund. The money had to be returned since it was from unverifiable sources. About 1 month after Mr. Trie delivered the bulk of these checks, President Clinton expanded the number of members of the U.S.-Pacific Trade and Investment Policy Commission and Mr. Trie was appointed to that Commission. The White House denied any connection between the donations and the delivery of the money, but questions remain unanswered. Mr. Trie also arranged for Chinese arms merchant Wang Jun to attend a White House coffee with President Clinton. Wang Jun is a former officer of the Chinese People's Liberation Army and was chairman of a Chinese company suspected of trying to import illegal automatic weapons into the United States. 
Did the President know about the Chinese Government's plan before 
his reelection campaign and his legal defense fund accepted hundreds of thousand of dollars in illegal donations? 
Was the President aware of this information when he allowed a Chinese arms dealer and manufacturer into the White House? 
Was Mr. Trie's appointment to the Trade Commission related to his generous donations to help pay the President's legal expenses and to aid his reelection efforts? 
All of these examples show just how many conflicts of interest exist for the Attorney General and the Department of Justice to investigate these allegations. And that is just what they are at this point--allegations. However, the independent counsel statute clearly provides under section 591(c)(1) and (d) of title 28, United States Code, that the Attorney General may invoke the independent counsel process when the Attorney General has received specific information from a credible source sufficient to constitute grounds to investigate whether a violation of any Federal criminal law, other than a Class B or C misdemeanor or infraction, may have been committed by any other person if such investigation or prosecution by the Department of Justice may result in a personal, financial, or political conflict of interest. 
The independent counsel statute is intended to allow the Attorney General to request the appointment of an independent counsel when this type of conflict of interest occurs involving those at the highest levels of our Government and top officers of the President's political party. I believe that Attorney General Reno has ample information and should therefore, invoke this provision of the statute to immediately request appointment of an independent counsel. 
Attorney General Reno testified before the Government Affairs Committee in favor of the reauthorization of the act. She testified that:  
The reason that I support the concept of an independent counsel with statutory independence is that there is an inherent conflict whenever senior Executive Branch officials are to be investigated by the Department and its appointed head, the Attorney General. The Attorney General serves at the pleasure of the President. . . . 
Section 591 (a) and (d) of the independent counsel law also contains a mandatory provision which requires the Attorney General to invoke the independent counsel process whenever the Attorney General has received specific information from a credible source sufficient to constitute grounds to investigate whether any Federal criminal law, other than a Class B or C misdemeanor or infraction, may have been violated by a covered person. 
There has been specific credible information publicly reported that officers and agents of the Democratic National Committee were acting under the direction of and pursuant to instructions given by the President, Vice President, and other top level officials in the White House and the Clinton-Gore reelection campaign. The President, Vice President, the Clinton-Gore Reelection Campaign chairman and treasurer are named in the statute as covered persons. 
If it is correct that certain officers and agents of the Democratic National Committee were acting under the direction of the reelection campaign and were in effect exercising authority for the campaign at the national level, then it is open to interpretation whether the chairman and top officers of the DNC would also be covered persons under the law. 
The law also provides a list of other covered persons which includes the Attorney General, certain top Justice Department officials, Cabinet Secretaries, and other top level administration officials. Any person working in the Executive Office of the President with a salary of $133,500 or above is also a covered person under the law. 
What this means is that if the Attorney General receives specific information from a credible source that any Federal criminal law, other than a Class B or C misdemeanor or infraction, may have been violated, Attorney General Reno must conduct a preliminary investigation and seek the appointment of an independent counsel if further investigation is warranted. 
There are numerous Federal laws that may apply to the allegations we have heard about and seen reported in the news: 
Title 18 of the United States Code, section 599 makes it unlawful for a candidate for Federal office to promise an appointment to any public or private position or employment in return for support of his candidacy. 
Section 600 makes it unlawful to promise employment, a contract, or other benefit in exchange for any political activity or support for a candidate or political party. 
Section 607 makes it unlawful for any person to solicit or receive any contribution intended to influence an election for Federal office in any [government] room or building. 
This is the tone that has been related to the President's fundraising coffers and also to the Vice President's phone calls. 
Section 641 makes it unlawful to convert Government property which includes telephones, copy machines, or Government computer records for ones own use. 
Section 201 makes it unlawful to give or offer a bribe to a public official in order to influence an official act. 
Section 205 makes it unlawful for a Government employee to act as an agent for anyone before a Federal agency on matters that the United States is a party or has a direct interest. 
Section 793 makes it unlawful to communicate national defense information to anyone not entitled to receive it. 
Section 794 makes it unlawful to communicate national defense information to a foreign government or representative of a foreign government. 
Section 219 prohibits a Federal Government official or employee from acting as foreign agent by delivering money actually derived from foreign countries. 
Sections 611-621 of the Foreign Agents Registration Act prohibit any person from acting in any capacity on behalf of a foreign government or foreign political party without registering with the Attorney General. 
Section 1905 makes it unlawful for a Federal employee to make an unauthorized disclosure of proprietary business information. 
Section 1956 is the money laundering statute. 
Section 1505 makes it unlawful to obstruct an agency or committee proceeding. 
All of these laws are subject to: 
Title 18, section 371, conspiracy statute which makes it unlawful to conspire to commit any offense against the United States; and sections 1341 and 1342, mail and wire fraud statutes which make it unlawful to use the mails, radio, or telephones in connection with any scheme to defraud or obtain money by false pretenses. 
Section 1001 false statements statute which makes it unlawful to make a false statement or use a document containing materially false statements in a matter before the executive branch and with some limitations, the judicial and legislative branches. 
The Federal election laws make it unlawful to: Solicit or accept political contributions from foreign nationals in section 441e; it makes it unlawful to knowingly accept a contribution made in the name of another person; section 441f; or makes it unlawful to solicit any contribution from persons with contracts with any government agency; section 441c. 
These are only a portion of the Federal laws that apply to the allegations currently under review. 
Recent news accounts of solicitations of campaign contributions by the Vice President, and possibly the President or senior White House staff, occurring in White House offices not used for residential purposes, or onboard Air Force One, may have violated Federal criminal laws prohibiting soliciting or receiving political contributions in any Government room or office or conversion of Government property to one's own use. 
There has been specific credible information publicly reported that the Cheyenne-Arapaho Indians of Oklahoma contributed $107,000 to the Clinton-Gore reelection campaign in order to meet with President Clinton to discuss the return of Federal lands. It also was reported that Clinton-Gore reelection campaign chief fundraiser Terrance McAuliffe may have offered a Government benefit of access in exchange for additional political support which may violate Federal law prohibiting the promise of a Government benefit in exchange for political activity or support. 
There has been specific credible information publicly reported that President Clinton, Vice President Gore, Deputy Chief of Staff Harold Ickes, and other covered White House and Clinton-Gore campaign officers coordinated the solicitation and expenditure of independent Democratic Party funds which may be in violation of the Federal election laws. It was further reported that Democratic party advertising and expenditures were directed toward the reelection effort which may have had the effect to render these funds subject to campaign finance limitations to which they otherwise were not subject. 
There has been specific credible information publicly reported that President Clinton met with Long Beach officials to advance a proposed contract between the city of Long Beach and the Chinese state-owned merchant fleet, the China Ocean Shipping Co., COSCO, to lease an abandoned United States Navy Station at Long Beach. It was also reported that individuals--Charlie Trie, Wang Jun, and Johnny Chung--with business interests linked to the Chinese shipping company made campaign donations to the Democratic National Committee and visited the President at a White House coffee during the negotiations for this lease which may have violated Federal laws if any promise of a Government benefit was given in exchange for political activity or support or if a promise of money from a foreign government was given. 
Yesterday, the Wall Street Journal reported that oil financier Roger Tamraz, who had an outstanding international arrest warrant for allegedly embezzling $200 million from a Lebanese bank, attended a White House coffee, a White House dinner and reception, and viewed a movie with President Clinton. All of these visits were allowed in spite of warnings from the President's own National Security Counsel Asian specialist's recommendation that Mr. Tamraz should have no future meetings or future access to the White House. Mr. Tamraz met with the NSC specialist in an attempt to obtain support from the administration for a multibillion dollar oil pipeline from the Caspian Sea to Turkey that he was negotiating to build. He then tried to set meetings with Vice President Gore and President Clinton. 
The specialist's advice appears to have been followed until Mr. Tamraz made donations of $50,000 and then $100,000 to the Democratic National Committee. When the National Security Counsel determined that it was not in the best interest of the United States to support Mr. Tamraz's business proposal or for his return to the White House, he went to the Democratic National Committee. 
Mr. Tamraz is quoted as saying that he thought that `through the DNC [he] could make a policy heard.' DNC Chairman Don 
Fowler is reported to have personally called the White House's NSC specialist and asked her to drop her opposition to Mr. Tamraz meeting with President Clinton. Mr. Fowler apparently also managed to have the CIA send over a paper on Mr. Tamraz which Mr. Fowler said would show that Mr. Tamraz had helped the United States in the past. The requested meetings with the President did occur. It was reported that Mr. Tamraz had four meetings with President Clinton in spite of these warnings. What did Mr. Tamraz do to warrant such special access? We know that he donated at least $177,000 to the DNC and it was reported that he raised more money from other large donors. 
Why was a man with an international arrest warrant, accused of embezzling $200 million from a foreign bank, allowed into the White House to meet with the President? 
Why was this same man allowed to meet with President Clinton over the objections of his own National Security Council Asia specialist's warnings? 
Why was the chairman of the Democratic National Party involving himself in foreign policy issues? 
Why did he call the National Security Council to attempt to change a decision? 
How did the chairman of the Democratic National Committee obtain a copy of a paper on a donor from the CIA and have it sent to the National Security Council? 
On whose authority was this done? 
Was the President aware of his party chairman's actions and did he approve? 
If not, why did he continue to meet with this man? 
What was requested in these meetings and was any benefit provided to Mr. Tamraz as a result? 
There has been specific credible information publicly reported that a cocaine dealer convicted of transporting nearly 6,000 pounds of cocaine into this country, Jorge Cabrera, met with President Clinton in the White House. Eric Wynn, convicted of 13 counts of stock fraud which allegedly was to benefit the Bonano crime family, met with President Clinton. And a man alleged to have been associated with Russian organized crime, Gregori Loutchansky, also met with President Clinton. Mr. Yogesh Gandhi contributed $325,000 to the DNC and met with President Clinton to give him a World Peace Award although reports allege that he owed $10,000 in back taxes and filed divorce papers in court that he was a pauper and could not afford to pay the court's fees. Numerous other specific allegations surrounding John Huang and Webster Hubbell have been widely reported and raised questions about their activities in relation to Chinese interests. 
All of these questions need to be answered. They clearly present a conflict of interest for the Attorney General and the Department of Justice. And they do involve credible information concerning covered persons that may have violated Federal law. 
Mr. President, I urge the Attorney General to appoint a special counsel to investigate these charges. I think the law calls for it. I think it is very clear. I do not think it is close. So I urge the Attorney General to appoint an independent counsel immediately. 
I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I rise today on behalf of victims of the Oklahoma City bombing and their families, as well as other victims of crime, to introduce the Victims Rights Clarification Act of 1997. The purpose of this legislation is to clarify the rights of victims of crime to attend and observe the trials of the accused and testify at the sentencing hearing. I want to express my sincere thanks to Senators Hatch, Leahy, Inhofe, Grassley, and Kennedy for their hard work in crafting this bipartisan legislation. 
During my tenure in the Senate, I have worked to ensure victims of crime have equal standing under the law with those who have violated the public trust. Progress has been made. The Victims' Bill of Rights, approved by Congress in 1990, guarantees that victims of crime may be present at public court proceedings, providing that a victim's attendance does not materially affect his or her testimony. In 1996, as part of the antiterrorism Bill, I included a provision based on my Crime Victim Restitution Act, which entitles victims of crime to receive full financial compensation directly from the criminal in the form of mandatory restitution. 
Too often, however, the rights of victims are sacrificed or forgotten. The Victims Rights Clarification Act of 1997 clarifies the intent of Congress with respect to the rights of victims to be present at trial and be heard during the sentencing phase of the proceedings. This piece of legislation further demonstrates the bipartisan will of Congress to protect the rights of victims, as well as the accused.

Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I want to compliment my colleague from Virginia, and echo some of the comments that he has made. I happen to have the distinction, as a couple of us do, to serve on both committees. I serve on the Rules Committee, and I serve on the Governmental Affairs Committee. I think the resolution that the Senator from Virginia brought to the floor--and I compliment him for it--says that we should abide by the jurisdiction of the committees. The Rules Committee has jurisdiction over campaign finance reform. It has had that jurisdiction for years. One of the reasons I became involved in the Rules Committee, one of the reasons I participated in the committee, and one of the reasons I requested time for participating, was because I am interested in 
campaign finance reform legislation, not just oversight on illegal activities. That is what the Governmental Affairs Committee investigates. That committee will be investigating a lot of things that have been discussed on the floor today and tomorrow and probably will be investigating these matters for some time this year, and rightfully so. 
I believe I even heard the President of the United States say that we should investigate some of the alleged laundering of foreign money to the Democratic National Committee. We should investigate whether foreign nationals have tried to influence American elections. I do think, however, that the Rules Committee can work on campaign reform and simultaneously have hearings on legal activities dealing with soft money and with independent expenditures. I do not think that it is appropriate that those hearings should be mixed up with the hearings on illegal activity. 
Think about it. We are talking about having people testify under oath and perhaps, by subpoena. I know from some of the subpoenas submitted by the minority that appear to focus on money spent by these groups--groups such as the Christian Coalition, Right to Life, the Sierra Club, the unions, and so on. A lot of organizations raise money and use that money to `educate their voters.' Maybe they do a lot more. Maybe they want to educate every voter in America. Organized labor put in millions of dollars in this last election. I am on the Rules Committee and I hope that we have hearings. I would say to the chairman of the Rules Committee, have hearings on soft money. What influence did it have on independent expenditures? 
I think it is perfectly proper for the Rules Committee to investigate campaign finance reform. We put in an extra $450,000 in this resolution for the Rules Committee to investigate `legal but improper' activities. If somebody deems a legal act to be improper, well that is the eyes of the beholder. But the Rules Committee, the committee of jurisdiction, the committee that will be charged with writing campaign finance reform, should be the committee that is going to be trying to figure out how you handle soft money. 
For those who have not really looked into campaign finance reform before, I will tell you: There is not an easy answer on soft money. Some people just say ban it. Well, if you just automatically say ban it, you probably have not thought about it very much. You probably have not thought, `Wait a minute. Are we going to tell an organization they can't communicate their views to members on legislation pending or on a Member's vote on whether they are for their side or against this side?' I do not think we want to do that. I think that can become an infringement on the people's rights of free speech. I think it may very well be declared unconstitutional. I really do not have any interest in us passing legislation just to have it to be declared unconstitutional by the courts. 
So my point is that issues concerning independent expenditures and soft money are not easily dealt with. I will tell my colleagues on the other side of the aisle that I would be happy to work with others that have ideas. I think there is a real imbalance in today's electoral system. Under today's laws, individuals are limited donations of $1,000. But you have unlimited expenditures on soft money. So an individual can only put in $1,000. But you might have a wealthy person put in $10 million to try to educate the populace on a particular issue. Another example, as the Senator from Virginia found out, you might run against a very wealthy candidate that might put in $12 million or $15 million and just swamp the airwaves. Yet, a Senator or another individual, if they don't have a lot of resources, would be limited to $1,000 per election, and $2,000 for a primary and general election. There are some real imbalances here and I would like to see us work to correct those. 
I think that is properly done in the Rules Committee, not the Governmental Affairs Committee. The Governmental Affairs Committee is not going to be marking up the legislation on this issue. When 
you are dealing with the oversight on independent expenditures, on soft money, on legal campaign activity and the investigations, the Rules Committee should lead. The investigations under the Governmental Affairs Committee is where we have the subpoena power. That is where we are talking about trying to uncover what has happened. We have constitutional responsibilities within this committee to exercise oversight and find out if the laws have been broken. That is one of our responsibilities on Government Affairs and we need to do it. 
I don't think it would be fair to be calling on people who have allegedly broken the law, having them sworn in, giving depositions under oath, making statements before the Governmental Affairs Committee, and then the next week be calling in groups under the same circumstances that were acting legally under the current system. I think they would be unfairly tainted with the same broad brush of illegal activity. I do not think that is right. I think it would be a mistake. 
So I compliment my colleague from Virginia. I think he has designed a good resolution, a resolution that we can pass. It is a resolution that protects the jurisdictions of each committee. We actually have three committees involved. We have the Governmental Affairs Committee, which has very broad jurisdiction. 
My colleague from Michigan asked if they can not investigate everything else. The Governmental Affairs Committee basically has the authority under its legislative authority to investigate almost anything related to Government. And so some people say, why even bother trying to delineate what they can investigate? They can investigate anything. However, I think what we have come up with a solution to let the Governmental Affairs Committee investigate the illegalities of the last election, whether it be congressional or presidential. Let the Rules Committee conduct hearings on campaign finance reform and soft money and include hearings on improper activities, if there truly were improper activities. Maybe we can come to a consensus on how to handle soft money or independent expenditures. And if we find Members who have violated the rules or the laws, have those be referred to the Ethics Committee. 
Some people say that the Ethics Committee is a chamber that no one hears from. I have been in the Senate now 17 years, and I can think of at least 5 Senators who are not here primarily as a result of the Ethics Committee. They do made a difference and they changed people's careers. They caused people to retire. They caused people not to run for reelection or they caused expulsion from the Senate. So the Ethics Committee does exercise its responsibility. 
I compliment my colleague from Virginia. I think the delineation and protection is important. Frankly, if I was chairman of the Rules Committee, I would guarantee you I would be down here fighting for my committee's jurisdiction. We do it all the time. The Rules Committee does have jurisdiction over campaign finance reform and it should fight to protect that. It should have any hearings on independent expenditures. And my colleagues, if they want to get into it, I am all for it. Have the hearings. But to me it is in the right scenario. It is not putting people under oath and subpoenaing documents and making them submit to the same procedures as when illegal activities before a committee are under consideration.

We may well have the debate on whether or not we will have a constitutional amendment to limit the first amendment as it pertains to speech in campaigns. Some people advocate that. I do not happen to be one. But again that is a fair debate and one that we will probably have in the Chamber.

Mr. NICKLES. I thank my colleague. Let me just make a couple of comments, Mr. President. One, we do have a group that is currently working on campaign finance reform. And to those who are saying that this effort of having the Rules Committee have jurisdiction over campaign reform is a stall--I think it is quite the opposite. I think having the Rules Committee retain its historical, legitimate jurisdiction over campaign reform is the right thing to do. I also think it is the best thing to do if you want to have real campaign reform, if you want to get something passed. 
Now, we can work simultaneously. I believe the Governmental Affairs Committee is going to be swamped. It has numerous allegations to review. Allegations have been made almost on a daily basis for weeks and weeks now. The list is very long. If you tack on to that, an additional general oversight on campaign reform, I think that bogs down the process for, one, getting the original investigation resolved and, two, it bogs down campaign reform. 
Now, I think by separating the two oversight responsibilities by having hearings on campaign reform in the Rules Committee, it will allow the Rules Committee to consider those issues and to go ahead and work on legislation. We may have to do the legislation in a couple of pieces. Some people are very adamant on passing campaign reform legislation this year and they think we can only do it in one piece. I would urge my colleagues--and I see my friend from Wisconsin here--who are really interested in campaign reform to think of possibly what we can do. What can we put together now that has bipartisan support that we can pass? 
I can think of several things. Full and immediate disclosure for soft money, for independent expenditures and for all hard money. There is a lot of money under the table right now. We do not have any idea, for example, how much total money that organized labor put into the campaigns. We do not have any idea how much different groups have put in. We could require immediate disclosure, and I bet we could get an overwhelming vote, even a unanimous vote, for immediate disclosure. 
I think we can do some other things. There are a lot of other good ideas but I do not know that I should throw all of them out because I am starting to negotiate on these with my Democrat colleagues who want to make some real reform. Maybe we could come up with a consensus package now that includes reform on individual and special interest money. Some people advocate confining money to being raised in their State or district. I am for looking into that. Let us negotiate and see if we cannot put together a package by having oversight in the Rules Committee to include issues of independent expenditures and soft money. Let us see if we can come up with an agreement on that. Maybe the hearings will evolve to where we can come to a consensus on these issues. Also, maybe at the conclusion of the Governmental Affairs Committee, we may find other statutes that need to be changed. 
Most of the things that we are looking at investigating right now concern statutes that are fairly clear. In some cases, they have been ambiguous. I noticed the statute in section 607, where it says it shall be unlawful for any person to solicit in a Government building. And the Vice President said he is exempt from the law. I find that to be a stretch. I do not see an exemption there for the Vice President. But if he is correct, maybe we need to change the law. 
And so maybe these hearings will evolve and we will learn a little bit more about what should be included in our laws. I am happy to do that. But I do not think the Rules Committee has to wait on the Governmental Affairs Committee to act. I am willing to act earlier. I am very, very serious about trying to work to see if we cannot come up with bipartisan consensus legislation. Once we have passed that, to see if we can come up with those elements that we can agree upon such as making sure, for example, that all contributions for political campaigns are voluntary. To me that is a fundamental right. We should have that in a package. 
So let us put together a package, pass it and then if we determine because of the Governmental Affairs Committee hearings or the Rules Committee hearings that we need to do further work, we can address it and pass that possibly later. 
So again, I compliment my friend from Virginia for his resolution. I am hopeful that we will be able to pass it soon. I am hopeful--I see my colleague from Ohio--that we will be able to work together in the Governmental Affairs Committee in a bipartisan fashion to get the facts out and to conclude. I will tell my colleague I was one that said let us try to wrap this up this year. I do not want this thing going on forever. So we will work towards that end. I thank my colleagues, and I yield the floor.

Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I thank the guest Chaplain, Dr. Charles Richmond from Edmond, OK, for a beautiful prayer. I also thank him for his service to our country as national chaplain of the American Legion, but also for his lifetime of dedication and service to God and country in his capacity as a leader. 
He has given his time to the American Legion, first serving as chaplain of the Oklahoma American Legion Boys State for the past 5 years and, more recently, becoming the national chaplain of the American Legion in September 1996. 
Dr. Richmond is an ordained Southern Baptist minister. He has touched the lives of the members of many churches throughout Oklahoma and across our country. Although now retired, he continues to be active in many church and religious activities. 
Dr. Richmond has been an educator. He has also served as a public schoolteacher, a coach, a counselor, and a principal. In addition, he served as dean of men and later dean of student affairs at the University of Central Oklahoma for over a quarter of a century. 
Dr. Richmond began his lifelong dedication to God and our country as a young man. In 1942, he entered World War II, the youngest person ever to enter the Chaplain Service. Only 30 days after entering the Army, he was sent overseas to Asia, where he devoted 2 1/2 years to serving United States troops during the China, Burma, and India campaign. In 1950, he was reactivated with the Oklahoma National Guard and served in Korea and Japan. While in Japan, he led the building of a Christian church which spawned 22 churches and missions over the next 10 years. Dr. Richmond later served 20 years as division chaplain of the Oklahoma National Guard. 
Dr. Richmond has served the community of Edmond as president of the Edmond, OK, club of Rotary International. In March 1996, he was chosen to serve as the Oklahoma State Senate chaplain. 
Today, I am honored to recognize Dr. Charles Richmond, a great American and Oklahoman, as guest Chaplain in the U.S. Senate. 
Dr. Richmond, again, I thank you for an outstanding prayer, words of encouragement--one that I hope all of us will certainly pay attention to.

Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I would like to thank my colleague, Senator Hatch, for his outstanding leadership on this very important constitutional amendment to balance the budget, as well as Senator Craig and others who have worked very hard to put us in a position to be able to pass this amendment. 
Mr. President, I have been here now for 17 years. I cannot think of a more important vote that I have ever cast than the vote we will be casting today. If we cast a vote in favor of passing a constitutional amendment to balance the budget, we will change the way we do business in Washington, DC. 
When we are sworn into office, we stand right here on the floor of the Senate, most of us with a hand on the Bible, saying we swear to uphold the Constitution of the United States. It will change the way we do business. It will mean we are going to start being responsible; we are going to quit spending more than we take in. It will not be easy. It will be a challenge, but we can do it. Almost all States do it. It does not mean it is easy, but they do it. And we should do it as well. 
I will read something from Thomas Jefferson. 
I wish it were possible to obtain a single amendment to our Constitution. I would be willing to depend on that alone for the reduction of administration of our Government to the genuine principles of its Constitution; I mean an additional article, taking from the Federal Government the power of borrowing. 
Thomas Jefferson was right. He also said: 
The question whether one generation has the right to bind another by the deficit it imposes is a question of such consequence as to place it among the fundamental principles of government. We should consider ourselves unauthorized to saddle posterity with our debts, and morally bound to pay them ourselves. 
He was exactly right. 
Mr. President, there is an article where countless Presidents, almost every President when they 
made a State of the Union Address, said they were going to lead us toward a balanced budget, including Bill Clinton, including Ronald Reagan, including George Bush, including almost all Presidents. But, unfortunately, we have not done it. And I say we. It is not just the administration. It is Congress. I think we need the constitutional constraint to get us there. 
In the last election, President Clinton and Bob Dole said, hey, we need a balanced budget. Some people said, well, that means that it is a done deal. That is not really the case. I heard my colleague and friend, Senator Leahy, say, well, the last 4 years we have brought the deficit down. The deficit has come down. What he did not say is the deficit last year was $107 billion. What he did not say is the next 4 years it goes up. According to CBO, the deficit goes up from $107 billion to, in 1997, $116 billion, and under President Clinton's budget to $142 billion in 1999, and $135 billion in the year 2000.

Mr. NICKLES. No; I have only a couple minutes. I will be quick. 
The point is, even under the President's budget, the deficit goes up. We have made some progress--and I think we can argue on who should take credit for that--but we are not making progress when the deficit is going up and it is higher in the year 2000 than it is in the year 1996. That is not balancing the budget. That is like somebody saying they are going to go on a diet, but first they want to gain 10 pounds for each of the next 3 years and, oh, yes, in the last year we are going to lose 40 pounds. That is what we have before us under the President's document. 
I think we need a constitutional amendment to make the President and to make Congress be responsible, to make the tough decisions. 
I am pleased that we are going to have 55 Republicans vote for this. I am disappointed that we do not have 12 Democrats to vote for it to make it happen. I wish we did. I think we are going to come up with 11. One of my jobs is to count votes. A couple of people basically are going to vote different than what they said they were going to do. That disappoints me. But regardless, we still have to roll up our sleeves, and I think we still have to balance the budget. I do not know there is the collective will to do it unless we have the constitutional restraint to make us do it. 
When an administration campaigns on a balanced budget and says, `Oh, yes, we brought the deficit down every year,' and then have the deficit go up in the next 4 years, I find a lot of shell games going on in budgeteering. That bothers me. I hope we will be responsible. I hope we will work together as Democrats and Republicans, not have a Republican budget, not have a Democratic budget, but work together to actually balance the budget and provide some tax relief. We can do it. But it is a lot easier said than done. 
I think we need a constitutional amendment to make us do it, to tell us to do it. One of the reasons I think we continually have a deficit is you are a lot more popular spending money for people than taking it away from people. 
Mr. President, I believe this is one of the most important issues we will have confronting us this Congress, maybe in our lifetimes. If we really do want to have Government act responsibly and quit saddling our children with additional debt --right now, per capita, that debt is over $19,000 per child, per person, per American. I do not think it is responsible for us to continue to add more debt on future generations. So I urge my colleagues to support a constitutional amendment to balance the budget later this afternoon. I yield the floor. 
Mr. LEAHY addressed the Chair.

Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senator Hatch, Senator Baucus, and Senator Breaux in the introduction today of the Software Export Equity Act, a bill to provide that software exports receive the same tax treatment as other products made in the United States. Our bill will help ensure that the U.S. software industry, the current world leader, maintains their competitive edge. 
The Software Export Equity Act simply clarifies that software produced in the United States for export fully qualifies for foreign sales corporation [FSC] export incentives the same as most other U.S. products. The bill proposes no special or unique benefit for the software industry, just equal and fair treatment under existing law. 
The FSC statute and its predecessor, the domestic international sales corporation statute, were enacted by Congress to help U.S. companies compete abroad. The FSC statute provides a tax exemption of up to 5 percent of a company's income attributable to export sales of U.S.-made products. Only those products manufactured or produced in the United States for export to a foreign market qualify for FSC benefits to ensure domestic economic growth and job creation. 
Unfortunately, the fledgling software industry was not specifically considered by Congress when the FSC statute was enacted, and subsequent Treasury Department rules disqualified them for FSC benefits. Indeed, Treasury's narrow interpretation allows nearly identical products, exported in an identical manner, such as movies and compact disc recordings, to fully qualify for FSC benefits, but not software. 
Repeated attempts to convince the Treasury Department to modify their rules have failed, Mr. President, leaving only the alternative of amending the law. Fortunately, this issue has broad bipartisan support in the House and Senate and was recently included in President Clinton's fiscal year 1998 budget request. 
Employing over 2 million people and exporting more than $26 billion in software each year, the U.S. software industry is an important and growing part of our economy. They lead the world in the development of innovative products and cutting-edge technology. In today's competitive global economy, incentives to encourage firms to develop products here for export abroad are vitally important. The enactment of this legislation will assure that we provide these incentives to all U.S. products equally. 
I encourage all my colleagues to join us in supporting this legislation.

Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, first I wish to compliment my colleague, Senator Hatch from Utah, for his leadership in this bill as well as Senator Domenici for his excellent statement. I hope our colleagues had a chance to listen to the Senator from New Mexico. He probably knows more about the budget than most all of us. He made an outstanding presentation. 
I urge our colleagues to vote against this amendment. I recognize this amendment may be good politics. It sounds kind of good. I have heard some people say, `If you vote for this amendment you are going to protect Social Security.' I totally disagree. As a matter of fact, I think it may have just the opposite result, or opposite conclusion. But it looks good. And, if it is reported by the press, `Well this one amendment was trying to protect Social Security,' if they write it like that, some people are going to assume that is correct. I think it has just the opposite result. 
I think, if we pass a constitutional amendment that says we are going to balance the budget, we are not going to spend any more than we take in but, oh, incidentally, we are going to exempt the largest and most popular program in Government, in other words we want to be in balance except for this very important, popular program, you just gutted the balanced budget amendment. There is no reason to have a balanced budget amendment. The amendment would say we are going to exclude the old age and survivors and Federal disability insurance program. You could include a lot of other things. Why not include Medicare? A lot of people think Medicare is the same thing as Social Security. It is all paid for by a payroll tax. Right now American citizens pay 12.4 percent for Social Security, which includes retirement and disability. And they pay another 2.9 percent in Medicare. There is no reason why we would not include that. You could define that as Social Security. 
As a matter of fact, in the President's budget he takes home health care--basically he takes it out of the Medicare trust fund and moves it over from part A to part B, and then says it is all going to be paid for by the Federal Government. 
My point is, you can shift around trust funds and I think you would find a multitude of programs running to be defined as Social Security. Let us throw in Medicare. Let us throw in welfare. Let us throw in anything else, and it will all be exempt from the balanced budget amendment requirement. That makes the balanced budget amendment a facade, it makes it a fraud, it makes it worthless. 
I am not saying this is from the sponsor of the amendment, but 
I think a lot of people who are going to vote for the amendment want that to happen. There are a whole lot of people who are going to vote for the amendment of the Senator from Nevada--not that they hope it will pass, they do not support a balanced budget amendment anyway. And I would include President Clinton in this category. He does not support a constitutional amendment to balance the budget. But now he raises the specter of Social Security, maybe to scare people into thinking that is a good way to kill the amendment; to kill the constitutional amendment to balance the budget. I regret that. 
I looked at a statement President Clinton made on January 28 at a press conference. He said, dealing with whether or not we should exclude Social Security that we couldn't right now. `Neither the Republicans nor I [and the Congress] could produce a balanced budget amendment tomorrow that could pass if Social Security funds cannot be counted,' if you will, as part of the budget. 
So the President is saying: Wait a minute, I use Social Security surpluses right now in my budget to get down to zero in the year 2002. So do the Republicans. President Clinton has in every single budget that he has had in the past. So have other Presidents. My point being he is now saying we will try to pass that amendment because he knows it is a killer amendment, not because he believes it is good policy. He knows it is bad policy. I think everybody, if they were asked legitimately, is this good policy, they would say, `No.' Is it good politics? They may say, `Well, it may be.' It might be good politics but it certainly is bad, bad policy. 
You should not have a constitutional amendment that says we are not going to spend any more than we take in and exclude the largest program in Government. You should not open it up to a program that is not really defined by the Constitution, and therefore every other program in Government could be added as part of Social Security. All of which would be excluded from the constitutional requirement. 
I think, frankly, when you are talking about the Constitution you should not be trying to write in the Constitution an exclusion for a particular Federal program. That does not fit. Again, it may fit for political purposes but it does not fit in the Constitution. It does not belong in the Constitution. 
So, Mr. President, I mention this, I have the greatest respect for my colleague and friend from Nevada. I am afraid a lot of people will be looking at this amendment and saying it has a lot of political appeal but substantively it should not be in the Constitution. We are dealing with serious business. We are right on the throes of having the vote to pass a constitutional amendment to balance the budget. I hope that we will in the next few days. We will not, in my opinion, I will tell my colleagues, we will not if we come up with this amendment. 
I have heard some people say if we just agree to this amendment I would vote for it in a minute. I don't think they would, not if they looked at what the results would be, not if they looked at the changes that would have to be made. I don't think that is accurate. This Senator would not vote for it because I think of it as a fraud. I think it would be misleading the American people and I don't want to do that. I think we should be serious in our legislating and I think we should be doubly serious when we are talking about a constitutional amendment in any form, and certainly one to balance the budget. 
So, Mr. President, with all respect I urge my colleagues to vote `no' on the Reid amendment and, hopefully, it will go down and then we will be able to pass a constitutional amendment to balance the budget in the next few days. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, when the House of Representatives passed the resolution, House Joint Resolution 36, which allowed for the releasing of funds, $30 million per month for 4 months, 4 months earlier than under current law--after they passed that resolution they also passed another resolution. It is called the Smith-Oberstar-Hyde Resolution, H.R. 581. H.R. 581 actually releases more money for international family planning, but it does have restrictions to make sure that none of that money would be used for abortion purposes. 
Since the House has already passed H.R. 581 and these are related issues, I would like now, at this point, to ask unanimous consent that the Senate vote on final passage on H.R. 581 at a time not later than Friday of this week.

Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Vermont. I ask his assistance. Hopefully we can get to a vote in the Senate on this other resolution. It is a different idea. Let me just compare the two so all our colleagues can see exactly what we are talking about. 
This is the current law. It says, basically, we are going to spend $420 million on international family planning funds. Under the administration's resolution, that will increase by $120 million. For 4 months there will be $30 million more per month. 
This is a convoluted way to do this. I was not involved in coming up with the consent agreement that arranged this. My sympathies go to my colleague from Vermont and the Senator from Kentucky, because they wrestled with this for a long time. I know Mr. Panetta was involved in this. We had a real impasse. 
Maybe I will give a little background in between, so our colleagues might remember, but there is a difference in philosophy on what we should do with international family planning money. The House felt very strongly we should continue the Mexico City restrictions, the Mexico City restrictions being restrictions that these moneys could not be used by an organization, international family planning organization, if they had involvement with abortion. Not only could they not use the U.S. taxpayer funds, but they could not use their own funds for abortion services, and they also could not promote changes in a country's laws dealing with abortions. Those are the two main restrictions known as the Mexico City policy, which was the policy in the United States from 1984 through, I believe, 1993. It was changed by the Clinton administration. So, it was the law of the land for 10 years. 
I might mention also that, under that policy, a significant number of organizations followed that policy. From 1984 to 1993 we had 350 foreign organizations that complied with the Mexico City policy. In other words, they accepted the money. They said the money will be used for family planning but not for abortions. They would not use our money, U.S. taxpayers' money, they would not use their own money, and they also would not advocate changing laws in other countries. 
Unfortunately, this was repealed by the Clinton administration shortly after he took office. The House of Representatives felt strongly it should be reinstated. After the House had a change of leadership in 1994, they reinstated the Mexico City policy. The Senate did not go along. So we had, if I remember, 10, 11, maybe even 12 votes in the last Congress over this issue, the Senate 
basically saying we want to reinstate our position of no prohibition on how the international family planning organizations use their money. If they want to use their money for abortion, they can use it for abortion. If they want to use their own money to advocate changing laws in other countries dealing with abortion--because a lot of countries have laws restricting abortions that this administration does not agree with and, frankly, the International Planned Parenthood Federation does not agree with, and they want to change it. So the Senate was concurring with the administration and the International Planned Parenthood Federation. The House was saying no, we should stay with the Mexico City policy. 
So we had a dozen votes, both sides insisting on maintaining their own positions. The net result was we came up with this terrible arrangement which basically said we will continue this policy at 35-percent less money--which, incidentally, I might mention we had a 35-percent reduction overall in the bill. Mr. Panetta said, let's have it the same way, and then we will dole the money out on a monthly basis and then we will have a vote in the next Congress over when that money will be released. That is what we are going to be voting on tomorrow. 
So, if we maintain current law, the amount of money will be $420 million. If we adopt the administration's resolution, it will be $543 million. Under these provisions there is no restriction on abortion in this and no restriction on organizations' lobbying capability. The House passed H.R. 531, the Smith-Oberstar-Hyde resolution that had a couple of million dollars more, about $170 million more. But the money had restrictions. The money has those restrictions that were, in effect, the law of the land from 1984 to 1993, that said these groups cannot use the money for abortion, they could not use the money for lobbying other governments to change their policies. 
I happen to think the Mexico City policy was right. If we are going to be giving money to international family planning organizations, it should be for family planning. It should not be for abortions. 
Somebody said, `You are not using U.S. taxpayer dollars for abortions. They are using their own money.' Some of these groups, like the London-based International Planned Parenthood Federation, are advocates of abortion. If we give them so much money, U.S. money, they can say, we do not use a dime of that for abortion. Sure, we will use some of our other money for abortion. And sure we will use some of our other money to advocate changes in other countries' laws that we don't agree with. So, really, you have U.S. taxpayer dollars subsidizing international organizations that are, in effect, lobbying other countries to change their laws because they deem them too restrictive on abortion. 
That is kind of offensive. It is not just these international groups that are doing it; it is the administration as well. I will just make a couple of comments. 
Donald Warwick of the Harvard Institute of International Development has written that the International Planned Parenthood Federation `has in word and deed been one of the foremost lobbyists for abortion in developing countries.' They are promoting abortion in developing countries, even to the extent of changing their laws. 
The International Planned Parenthood Federation has made it clear that legalizing abortion and expansion of abortion networks is one of its primary goals. Their 1992 mission statement Strategic Plan--Vision 2000 repeatedly and unambiguously instructs its 140 national affiliate organizations to work to legalize abortion as part of a mandate to `advocate for changes in restrictive national laws, policies, practices and traditions.' 
So, we are supporting and giving money to the International Planned Parenthood Federation so they can use that money, or other money, to lobby, to tell some countries that happen to have pro-life laws that they have to change their law. That bothers me. What makes us so self-righteous that we know that other countries should be changing their laws dealing with abortion? How can we be 
so self-righteous? 
Then we find out it is not only some International Planned Parenthood organization, but we see it from our own State Department. On March 16, 1994, through Secretary of State Warren Christopher in a classified action cable to all overseas diplomatic posts, the State Department announced, `The United States believes access to safe, legal and voluntary abortion is a fundamental right of all women,' and called for `senior level diplomatic intervention' to garner support for the U.S. position at the September U.N. conference on population in Cairo. 
On May 12, 1993, Under Secretary of State Tim Wirth expounded the policy in a detailed speech at the United Nations, stating, `A government which is violating basic human rights should not hide behind the defense of sovereignty * * * Our position is to support reproductive choice, including access to safe abortion.' 
Why in the world would we have the Under Secretary of State make a speech to the United Nations telling other countries we think we know better, you should change your laws. We think you should have pro-choice laws in countries such as El Salvador or other countries that have maybe a predominantly Catholic population and have pro-life laws or laws restricting abortions? Why in the world would we be so self-righteous or sanctimonious that we should be telling those countries, We know best. Change your laws. We think you should have legal abortion. Maybe we think you should subsidize it. 
That, to me, is offensive, to think that the Secretary of State or Under Secretary of State would have that position. 
April 1, 1993, White House Deputy Press Secretary Dee Dee Myers noted the administration regards abortion as `part of the overall approach to population control.' 
And if we don't enact H.R. 581, the Smith-Oberstar-Hyde language, then what we are doing is giving this administration a blank check to give money to international organizations that have no restrictions whatsoever on how they use their money on abortion or changing laws in other countries. I think that is wrong. 
So for my colleagues, just to summarize, we have a couple of options. We can accelerate the money with no restrictions whatsoever or, if you happen to be in favor of more family planning money, if you want more family planning money to go out internationally and you think that might reduce the incidents of abortion, you can do that, you can support the Smith-Oberstar-Hyde language. 
We are going to try to get a vote on it. The House already passed it. Tomorrow it will be pending at the Senate desk. We hope to get a time agreement. I understand some people say, `We want to filibuster that.' Why? What is the matter with having a vote? Let's find out where the votes are. 
There is more money. This has $713 million for family planning. House Joint Resolution 36, which will be voted on tomorrow, has $543 million. There is $170 million more money for international family planning, but it has restrictions. You will not be able to use that money or your money for abortion. So, if you want less abortions, you should support the Smith-Oberstar-Hyde language, and if you think it is wrong for our country to be advocating that other countries change their laws dealing with abortions, then you need to support that resolution as well. 
So I urge my colleagues to vote no on the resolution we will have pending tomorrow, House Joint Resolution 36. Vote `no' on that and then vote in favor of H.R. 581, the Smith-Oberstar-Hyde language, which will have more money for international family planning and no money for abortion and no money for advocating changes in other countries' abortion laws. 
I yield the floor, and I thank my colleague from Vermont.

Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I rise today, and begin with these words: `We hold these Truths to be self-evident, that all Men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness.' 
These profound words are possibly the most known words from our Declaration of Independence. They state a principle that is fundamental to who we are as a nation; life itself is a gift from our Creator, and it is a right that can not be taken away. We are a nation whose core philosophy is to care for its people. 
As public servants, we deal with issues that affect the lives of people every day. Caring for people is the underlying aspect of almost every piece of legislation dealt with in the Senate, and nearly every issue we confront as a country. 
But while we work to build up America, something is at work in the country, eating away at fundamentals we used to take for granted: in this case, the sanctity of life. It is no secret that I place a high value on life at its conception. But a disturbing trend has developed over the past few years, a devaluation of life as it nears its end. 
Two years ago, I offered legislation banning the use of Medicaid and Medicare funds for assisted suicide in the 1995 balanced budget act. Unfortunately the President vetoed this legislation. 
Today, I am proud to be a cosponsor of the legislation offered by Senators Ashcroft and Dorgan, which prohibits any Federal funds from being used for assisted suicide, euthanasia or mercy killing. This means that hospitals, medical institutions, or health care providers are not required to participate in procedures they morally or ethically oppose. 
The large majority of people oppose assisted suicide. In a Wirthlin poll taken November 5, 1996, 87 percent of the people asked said tax dollars should not be spent to pay for the cost of assisting suicide or euthanasia. A recent study by the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston, found that seriously ill cancer patients in severe pain are unlikely to `approve of, or desire' euthanasia or physician-assisted suicide, instead they desire `only relief from their pain'. 
Even the medical profession is opposed to assisted suicide. An amicus brief filed by the American Medical Association to the Supreme Court on November 12, 1996, contends assisted suicide `will create profound danger for many ill persons with undiagnosed depression and inadequately treat pain, for whom assisted suicide rather than good palliative care could become the norm. At greatest risk would be those with the least access to palliative care--the poor, the elderly and members of minority groups.' The brief concludes, `Although, for some patients it might appear compassionate to hasten death, institutionalizing physician-assisted suicide as a medical treatment would put many more patients at serious risk for unwanted and unnecessary death.' 
Dr. Joanne Lynn, board member of the American Geriatrics Society and director of the Center to Improve Care of the Dying at George Washington University said--Health Line, Jan. 8, 1997--`No one needs to be alone or in pain or beg a doctor to put an end to misery. Good care is possible.' 
As Tracy Miller, former head of the New York Task Force on Life and Law said, `It is far easier to assist patients in killing themselves than it is to care for them at life's end.' 
The bill before us today is a major step in continuing to provide the care our elderly, poor, and seriously ill need and deserve. The bill would assure that the programs designed to support human life and health would not be transformed into implements of death. I commend the work of Senator Ashcroft and Senator Dorgan in writing this legislation, compliment them upon its introduction today, and pledge to work with them to see it to passage in the 105th Congress. Our country deserves no less.

Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, today the Senate will be in a period of morning business until 1 o'clock this afternoon. At 1 o'clock, the Senate will resume consideration of Senate Joint Resolution 1, the constitutional amendment requiring a balanced budget. By unanimous consent, Senator Wellstone will be recognized to offer an amendment or two at 1 p.m. We hope to be able to complete all debate on Senator Wellstone's amendments today. However, any votes ordered on those amendments will occur during Tuesday's session. 
Beginning at 3:30 today, the Senate will resume 2 hours of debate on Senator Durbin's amendment regarding economic hardship. Under the order, a vote will occur on or in relation to the Durbin amendment at 5:30 this afternoon. I want to repeat that there will be a rollcall vote at 5:30 this afternoon. I also remind my colleagues that the Senate is scheduled to adjourn for the President's Day recess on Thursday of this week. In addition, tomorrow President Clinton is coming to the Capitol for a meeting, and also for Senators' information, the funeral for Ambassador Harriman is scheduled for Thursday. Therefore, this week will be busy as we continue to make progress on the balanced budget amendment and consider any nominations that may become available. 
I might mention that it is possible we could have a vote on the U.S. Trade Representative this week, and it's even possible on Congressman Richardson, who is up for U.N. Representative. As always, we will try to keep all Senators advised on the schedule for the remainder of the week, as well as any ordered rollcall votes. There is a vote this evening at 5:30 in relation to the Durbin amendment. 
I thank my colleagues and I yield the floor.

Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I wish to compliment Senator Collins for an outstanding maiden speech, her first speech on the Senate floor. I think the speech speaks very well for itself and for Senator Collins. I think it also speaks very well for the State of Maine, in showing excellent taste, making an excellent decision in electing Senator Collins. I look forward to working with her and joining with her and with Senator Snowe and following the tradition of Senator Margaret Chase Smith, who was one of the pioneers in the Senate. 
I wish to compliment the Senator from Maine for an outstanding speech. Several of the things which she mentioned in her speech we have very high on our agenda. Senator Collins mentioned that she wanted to pass a constitutional amendment to balance the budget. We are going to be discussing that today, and hopefully we will be voting on that very soon, certainly by the end of this month. 
Hopefully, we will pass it. I might mention, Senator Collins' election may well be the deciding vote in making that happen, because in the last Congress, we failed by one vote. So, again, every election is important. 
I compliment the Senator from Maine for an outstanding speech and reassure her that I share many of her objectives. She mentioned reducing the inheritance tax to help small business. I couldn't agree more. 
I compliment her on an outstanding speech and compliment the people of Maine for sending two outstanding Senators to serve and join us in the U.S. Senate. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.

I hope every American could hear that speech, a very well-thought-out speech on the necessity and importance of a balanced budget amendment. 
I think Senator Enzi's credentials are certainly meritorious of that statement, the fact he is an accountant by trade, a businessman, former State legislator as well as mayor. I compliment him and thank him for his well-thought-out speech. I hope everyone will pay attention to it and follow his advice and pass this amendment.

Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, yesterday, in a moving ceremony, we witnessed the swearing in of President Bill Clinton and Vice President Al Gore for their second term. The inaugural ceremony is significant not only to the history of our Nation, but for the message it sends to the rest of the world about our democracy. 
The ceremony required a tremendous amount of planning by many, many people. The extensive preparations included construction of the platform, ticket distribution, coordination of security measures, organization of the ceremony, planning the luncheon in Statuary Hall and countless other tasks. 
Leading this team of dedicated people was the distinguished Senator from Virginia, Senator John Warner. As chairman of the Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies, he had the monumental task of making the arrangements for this historic occasion. He performed his responsibilities with great efficiency and with outstanding attention to every detail. As master of ceremonies, he skillfully orchestrated the entire program. I, along with my colleagues, would like to thank Senator Warner and congratulate him on a job well done. 
In addition, I would like to applaud the distinguished Senator from Kentucky, Senator Wendell Ford. His contribution of hard work and past experience as Chairman of the committee was evident in the success of this endeavor. I wish to express my gratitude to Senator Ford for his hard work. 
I would also like to thank and congratulate the other members of the Joint Inaugural Committee for such a successful ceremony. Those members were Majority Leader Lott, Speaker Gingrich, Representative Armey, and Minority Leader Gephardt. In addition, the members of the committee were ably assisted by the officers and employees of the Senate and House of Representatives, as well as by personnel from the executive branch. The success of the ceremony demonstrated tremendous cooperation between both parties, as well as both Houses of Congress and the executive branch. 
I offer my appreciation to everyone who contributed countless hours to the 1997 inauguration ceremony, particularly to the chairman, Senator Warner, and the ranking member, Senator Ford. Thanks to the efforts of all involved, the ceremony will be a memorable event for our Nation.

Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I wish to congratulate and compliment the majority leader of the Senate for his statement today, but also for his work with all of the 55 Republican Senators to put together this list. 
This is a list which we have spent some time on. When I say `we,' I am talking about all 55 Republican Senators, who had some input on this list. That is a little unusual. We have not done that before. We came up with 10 bills. In the past, our tradition has been to introduce five. We came up with 10. 
I might mention later today, or in the next few days or weeks, we had several other bills people wanted to have in this list. But this list represents a consensus of an overwhelming number of Republicans, that these are positive things we can do, should do, and that we should pass this year. 
Mr. President, let me just comment and take a second to compliment President Clinton on his inaugural address yesterday. President Clinton made two or three comments that I would like to refer to. 
He said Government is not the problem, it is not the solution; the American people are the solution. I think you will find that we Republicans really do believe the American people are the solution. We have a lot of ideas for saving Medicare, saving Social Security, a lot of different things where we really want to involve the American people. 
I compliment the President on that. He said that Government should live within its means. 
The first item that Majority Leader Lott mentioned was a constitutional amendment to balance the budget. We have overwhelming support among our colleagues for passage of a constitutional amendment to balance the budget. We are equally serious about passing legislation to implement a balanced budget. We want that to happen. Unfortunately, President Clinton vetoed that in the last Congress. We want to work with the President. He said in the inaugural address that we should live within our means. We are going to try and make that happen. We look forward to working with this administration to make that happen. 
The President also said we should put petty politics and extreme partisanship aside. He is right. This Congress, this political year, maybe in the last year or two, has become too partisan and maybe too extreme in working with the administration. It has been too partisan. It has been too extreme. We need to put that aside. 
So I welcome the President's comments. I look forward to working with President Clinton in this administration to implement many of the things he talked about. A lot of things we have in this agenda are targeted toward doing exactly that. 
The constitutional amendment to balance the budget has overwhelming support among the membership, and rightfully so. We should live within our means. Almost all the States have provisions in their constitution saying they will not spend more than they take in. We should follow that guidance. 
President Clinton, during the campaign, said he was in favor of tax relief. S. 2, the second bill we have in our list, does provide for family tax relief. Even during the campaign, President Clinton talked of a $500-per-child tax credit. That is the foundation of our tax bill. Senator Lott mentioned 80 percent of the tax bill we have introduced as the leadership package. We passed that last year, but again President Clinton vetoed it. He said in the campaign that he was in favor of it. We want to pass it this year and we want it to become law. We are not interested in passing legislation for legislation's sake or for political points' sake. President Clinton is not running again. We want these bills to become law because they will have a positive, real impact on American lives. 
We define the child tax credit as children up to age 18. President Clinton's proposal limited it to kids under 12. We think it should include at least kids up to 18. I told some people that my kids range up to age 26. We might have an amendment to make it age 26. The bill we introduced takes it to age 18. 
We provide estate tax relief. There is a small business advisory council that advises the President and those of us in Congress and they always have an estate tax relief on their list. Why? Because if you have a taxable estate right now above $600,000, Uncle Sam starts taking big bites. If your estate goes up to a million above that, Uncle Sam wants 35 percent of it. If you have an estate of 3 million, say your business is as a farmer or a rancher or a businessman, if it is 3 million above the $600,000 deduction, Uncle Sam says, `We want 55 percent of anything above that amount.' Instead of protecting property, it is confiscating property. We want to reduce that, especially for small business and especially for family-owned operations. That is in our package, as well. 
We have capital gains relief because we think we tax transactions too much. We actually tax transactions more than almost any of our other industrial competitors. We need to reduce the taxes on transactions. If we do so, we will have more transactions and the Government will make more money, not less money. That is in our package. We can do better with the economy. 
I think we put together a good package, one that is family friendly. We have a provision that Senator Lott alluded to called the Family Friendly Workplace Act--Senator Ashcroft has worked hard on it--giving families the option that if they work a few 
extra hours one week, we think they can take off for their kids the next week. Why have good Government come in saying, `We mandate you have time off for PTA.' Why not let the families and employees make that decision? So we do that. We provide much greater flexibility for families, employers and employees in this bill. It is all on a voluntary basis, where they can work a few more hours one week and take time off for whatever they desire the following week. You do not need Government's blessing to do it. They allow for compensatory time. Instead of taking time-and-a-half if they have to work an hour or two above 40 hours, if they want they can bank some time and take time-and-a-half off. If they worked 44 hours, under present law they would be entitled to 6 hours of overtime pay. If they want to keep it that way, they have the right to do so. If they would like to have 6 hours off and maybe have a day off or maybe work some other kind of combination or schedule that meets their family's needs and desires, maybe for a vacation day, maybe for more time off, maybe for time to visit their kids' athletic events, they have the right to do so without having the Federal Government enumerate that this is what you have to offer by law, and not be paid for that time. We give them, through flextime and through the comp time, the ability to have the flexibility in their schedules to meet their family's needs, all of which are different. All of our families are different. All of our families have more time demands that are at variance. This gives them that flexibility, and probably would be the most family friendly thing we can do. 
We provide for a balanced budget package which will say the Government will live within its means. We are not going to spend more than we take in. Interest rates will come down. Homes will be more affordable. When we talk of family tax credits, if you have three kids under the age of 18, that is $1,500 more you get to spend as you desire. Maybe it is for education, maybe it is for food on the table, maybe it is for a home. You make that decision, because we decided it is your money, not Government's money. 
Then the flextime proposal, where we are basically saying that families can make the decisions. You have the flexibility in your schedules to work out what is mutually beneficial with you and your employer.

Mr. NICKLES. We also have an additional provision called the Paycheck Protection Act. It is fundamentally prodemocracy. It says no person should be compelled to contribute to a political organization without their consent. That person may be a stockholder. No one should be compelled, as a condition of employment, to contribute to a political group or organization, whether that be a PAC, whether it be a union organization or what. No one should be compelled. That is what this bill says. No one will be compelled to contribute to a political organization or entity or candidate against their will. They would have to sign a written authorization form before they would have contributions taken out. 
Mr. President, I compliment Senator Lott and all my colleagues for their work in putting this list together. I look forward to working with the minority leader and others on the other side of the aisle. I know they have their agenda list. I look forward to hearing what that is, and I look forward to working with them to see if we can have several items beneficial not for Congress but for the American people.

Mr. NICKLES. Madam President, this bill, the Paycheck Protection Act, sponsored by myself, Senators Gregg, Lott, Inhofe, Hutchison from Texas, Cochran, Roberts, Hagel, Smith from New Hampshire, and Kempthorne, deals with making sure that no one is compelled to contribute to political campaigns with which they disagree. Senator Ford made an eloquent speech on campaign finance reform. I don't disagree with everything he said. I just disagree with parts of it. 
Campaign reform is an issue a lot of us are going to be dealing with this year. It is important, in my opinion, Madam President, that we encourage people to participate in campaigns. We want more people all across the country to participate in the electoral process. It is a sad day when only half of the people vote in a Presidential election. Madam President, it is very important that nobody be compelled to contribute to a campaign with which they disagree. You might think, well, wait a minute, how in the world in 1997, in this day and age, would anybody be compelled to contribute to a campaign with which they disagree? But it happens. Unfortunately, Madam President, every week millions of Americans are having money taken out of their paycheck to contribute to candidates that they may well disagree with, but they didn't have a voice, a choice, or an option. 
Madam President, that is wrong. I will tell you that the origin of the bill we are introducing came from a town meeting that I had, where an individual--a union member--stood up in a town meeting and said, `I really resent the fact that my money is taken from me, without my vote, without my voice, without my option, and given to candidates and parties which I totally oppose.' I said, `I agree with you. We will try to remedy that.' 
That should not happen in America. That is something that sounds like it might happen in some totalitarian state where moneys or assets are confiscated and some corrupt politician would use it against their will. It is happening today. Millions of Americans are finding part of their paychecks taken from them without their voice or choice and used for political purposes with which they disagree. 
Madam President, this bill, the Paycheck Protection Act, which is sponsored by several of us, basically is very simple. It says that no individual, no employee working for a corporation, would be compelled to contribute to a political organization without their express consent. As a matter of fact, it says that no deduction from their wages would be used for political purposes unless they give prior written consent. 
Consent is the big issue. If we are going to have campaign reform, I am going to tell my colleague, this is going to have to be part of the package. 
This is America. No one should be compelled to contribute to political purposes for which they disagree. And that applies for an individual where maybe their company has a PAC (political action committee), and maybe the board of directors or the officers say, `We want everybody to contribute.' They can say what they want, but they cannot compel. No one should be compelled to contribute to a political organization, a political action committee, or to a labor organization against their will for political purposes. It is that simple. 
As Thomas Jefferson said, `To compel a man to furnish funds for the propagation of ideas he disbelieves or abhors . . . is sinful and tyrannical.' 
We're not talking about nickels and dimes here, but untold millions of dollars in partisan political campaigns and propaganda. Since such funds are not required to be disclosed, it is impossible to determine the exact amount of this spending. However, estimates of this under-the-radar spending is somewhere between $300 million and $1 billion for this most recent election. 
The way it is now, an employee paying dues to a labor organization has no choice over whether or not that labor organization can collect the money for politics. The only choice these employees have in the matter is to ask for a refund of the portion dues which is to be used for politics. This refund process is so lengthy and burdensome that it is next to impossible for someone to get their money back. Furthermore, for an employee to exercise their right to a refund of such dues, they are required to give up their right to vote in the labor organization that they are still required to pay for representing them. This is taxation without representation. 
The Supreme Court has consistently ruled that employees paying dues to a labor organization cannot be forced to also pay for the activities outside the core representational activities, such as costs associated with political activities. The Clinton administration, however, has kept employees in the dark regarding the minimal rights they do have. One of the first acts of this administration was to repeal the very regulations to carry out the Supreme Court's decision, which protected employees forced to pay for politics. 
People are recognizing the wrong brought upon Americans who have been given no choice in supporting causes for which they oppose. Even the administration's own National Labor Relations Board [NLRB], which has strong labor organization sentiments, recently ruled dues-paying employees are in the least entitled to information setting forth the percentage of those dues not related to collective bargaining activities. While this is a step in the right direction, more needs to be done. 
The Paycheck Protection Act protects employees from having their money involuntarily taken from them and used for politics. The act protects stockholders and employees of a corporation from having, as a condition of employment, dues, initiation fees, or other payments for politics taken from them without the separate, prior, written, voluntary authorization. Similarly, the act protects employees paying dues to a labor organization from having such dues, initiation fees, or other payments taken from them which are used for politics. 
Mr. President, this act furthers the basic civil right spoken of by Thomas Jefferson. It does so by requiring that individuals not be compelled to fund or support activities outside the legitimate scope of the employer or labor organization. This bill pro-worker, pro-labor organization, and most importantly, pro-American. 
I look forward to a broad bipartisan support for this bill.

Mr. NICKLES. Madam President, Senator Grams and Senator Hutchinson will be introducing legislation dealing with the $500 tax credit per child. I compliment them on this legislation. I am happy to cosponsor it with them. It is outstanding legislation that will restore individual families the opportunity to keep more of their own money. I might mention that the definition of `child' in the legislation which we are introducing includes children up to age 18 in contrast to that introduced by the President which is up to age 12, a big difference. It is a very profamily, very positive protaxpayer piece of legislation of which I am very happy to cosponsor. And I compliment my colleagues from Minnesota and Arkansas for their leadership on this issue. 
I yield the floor. 
Mr. GRAMS addressed the Chair.
