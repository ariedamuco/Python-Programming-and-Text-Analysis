   Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, the wonderful tree currently gracing the West lawn of this Capitol is from Colorado. I have had the pleasure of working towards getting this tree to DC for 2 1/2 years, and I wanted to share with my colleagues a little about my home state's gift to the nation. 
   The Millennium Holiday Tree is a gift from the entire state of Colorado to our nation. It is a celebration of all that is Colorado: natural beauty, many cultures, cities and rural communities, and our rich history. The Colorado tree will be shining through early January 2001. The Millennium Holiday Tree is a native Colorado Blue Spruce which stands 65' tall and was projected to be 77 years old at the time of cutting. It was grown on the Pike National Forest near the community of Woodland Park. The tree was selected from this area because it is in the shadow of Pikes Peak, often referred to as ``America's Mountain''. 
   The Colorado State Forest Service is growing seedlings from the ``grandma'' tree. Seedlings from the Millennium Holiday Tree will be replanted at the cutting site. The Governor and Francis Owens were among the first to receive a Holiday Tree seedling for their support of this project. Hundreds of seedlings will also be planted in memorial forests around the state as part of Holiday Tree celebrations. 
   Colorado school children made over 4,000 ornaments for the tree. They each depict the theme: ``Valuing the Past--Looking to the Future''. Each county had the opportunity to supply 100 ornaments for the Millennium Holiday Tree and the companion trees. 
   Through the many community events, we celebrated the richness of Colorado. Each reflected the wide range of cultural and historical influences present in our communities--Native American, Hispanics, pioneers, and others. Local celebrations were encouraged in each of Colorado's 64 counties and at each of the 10 stops along the Tree route. Santa Fe Trail communities in Kansas and Missouri joined the celebrations too, including one in St. Louis at a National Park Service historic site. After the cutting ceremony on November 20th, the tree was  moved indoors where the limbs were drawn up and secured for the long journey. A 65-foot trailer, designed to look like a historic Conestoga pioneer wagon, hauled the tree. Organizers used an experimental shrink wrap method to keep the tree fresh and secure from weather damage. The tree traveled caravan-style here to our nation's Capitol following the Santa Fe Trail, a historic trade route through Colorado, Kansas and Missouri. My friend and our colleague from Colorado, Senator BEN NIGHTHORSE CAMPBELL, actually drove the tree carrying truck all the way out here. He told me he had a great time, and I believe him. 
   Sixty four smaller companion trees, one from each county, traveled with the Millennium Holiday Tree and were placed in various government offices throughout DC. 
   This entire project was made possible through generous financial and in-kind support from the many sponsors. Volunteers, donations, and sponsorships made it all possible. Unused surpluses from this project will be set aside for a rural endowment fund. The year 2000 will be the 31st year a tree has been provided by the U.S. Forest Service and its partners. And I want to especially thank Dr. Raitano and Bill Nelson for their incredible work on this. They ``parented'' the project for years and it is due to their efforts it all turned out so well.

   Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, on December 7, 2000, the Senate approved H.R. 5640, the American Homeownership and Economic Opportunity Act of 2000. I earlier introduced S. 3274, the Senate companion to this legislation. Title IV of H.R. 5640 included several technical corrections to the Homeowners Protection Act of 1998. These technical corrections have no specific effective date attached to them. In my view, it is the expectation of Congress that lenders impacted by those technical corrections should have a reasonable period of time to make systems changes and conform administrative processes to the new law. This flexibility is important because the Homeowners Protection Act of 1998 does not authorize a Federal agency to provide implementing regulations.

   Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Senate version of the American Homeownership and Economic Opportunity Act of 2000, which is now at the desk. It is S. 3274. 
   I am pleased that this legislation is cosponsored by both the chairman and ranking member of the Banking Committee, Senators PHIL GRAMM and PAUL SARBANES, as well as the ranking member of the Housing subcommittee, Senator JOHN KERRY. 
   This legislation reflects a bipartisan and bicameral agreement on the housing legislation that should be enacted before the close of this Congress. Also joining as cosponsors are Senators RICHARD SHELBY, RICK SANTORUM, ROD GRAMS, BEN NIGHTHORSE CAMPBELL, and DANIEL INOUYE. 
   This legislation is the product of negotiations that have taken place between the House and Senate over the past several months. It has been introduced in the House of Representatives today, and if all goes well, it will be approved by both Houses and delivered to the President within the next several days. 
   In addition to housing provisions, this legislation also includes a number of regulatory relief provisions, banking and housing reporting requirements, and several items related to the Federal Reserve. An explanation of each provision is included in the section-by-section that follows my comments. 
   This legislation includes important home ownership, rural housing, elderly housing, disabled housing, and housing affordability barrier removal provisions. This bill also includes the Manufactured Housing Improvement Act championed by Senator SHELBY, provisions dealing with Native American housing sponsored by my Colorado colleague, Senator BEN NIGHTHORSE CAMPBELL, and Native Hawaiian provisions sponsored by Senator DANIEL INOUYE. 
   This legislation also includes the Private Mortgage Insurance Technical Corrections and Clarification Act which clarifies a number of provisions enacted by the 105th Congress to address the issue of private mortgage insurance cancellation and termination. 
   Nearly 2 years ago, I became chairman of the Banking Committee's Subcommittee on Housing and Transportation. My priority during this time has been congressional oversight of the Department of Housing and Urban Development. During the 106th Congress, our subcommittee held 19 hearings. Twelve of these hearings dealt specifically with HUD oversight. I have also made a point to develop a legislative agenda that focuses on innovative approaches to increase the supply of affordable housing. 
   Our subcommittee held a number of hearings to review legislative proposals on affordable housing, manufactured housing, homelessness, elderly and disabled housing, and the Federal Housing Administration mortgage insurance program. 
   While we have not been able to do everything we would like in the 106th Congress, I am pleased that this legislative package I am introducing today reflects significant progress on a number of housing initiatives. 
   On July 26, 2000, I introduced the Local Housing Opportunities Act, S. 2968, which reflects a long-term approach to empower communities and individuals by consolidating and reforming HUD programs. 
   While there is much that remains to be done on this 
   legislation, I am pleased that a number of the provisions included in S. 2968 have been enacted or are included in today's introduced legislation. 
   An extension of the simplified FHA downpayment calculation was included in the fiscal year 2001 VA-HUD appropriations bill, and today's legislation permits Section 8 funds to be used for home ownership downpayment assistance. It allows for the use of Section 8 assistance in grandfamily housing assistance with HOME funds, provides assistance for self-help housing providers, and includes several improvements in the rural housing programs at the Department of Agriculture. 
   I also note that tax legislation is currently pending that includes significant increases in the caps of both the low-income housing tax credit and private activity bond programs. If we do not get this legislation enacted this year, I will continue to work hard with my colleagues to get this done in the 107th Congress. 
   Early in this session of Congress, the Subcommittee on Housing and Transportation set out to modernize the standards for manufactured housing. On October 5, 1999, the subcommittee held a comprehensive hearing on the proposed manufactured housing legislation. This legislation worked its way through the Senate in 1999 under the leadership of Senator SHELBY. The House included similar legislation in a broader housing bill, and we have now reached agreement between the two Chambers on the compromise legislation. 
   This is a tremendous achievement that will contribute significantly to an increase in the amount of affordable housing in our communities. I know from my work in Colorado that this will have a positive impact on the affordable housing shortage in my State. 
   Today's legislation includes several provisions to encourage the removal of regulatory barriers to affordable housing. While this is largely a State and local issue, there are steps that can be taken at the Federal level to help ensure that government at all levels does not put excessive fees, permits, and regulations in place that drive up the cost of housing. In many cases these barriers move housing beyond the means of working families. I know this is an important issue for homebuilders in Colorado and throughout the Nation.  
   As chairman, I will continue to work with local government and housing advocacy organizations during the 107th Congress to discourage and remove regulatory barriers to affordable housing. 
   It has been my pleasure to work with Senator RICK SANTORUM on a number of important provisions to improve the Section 202 and Section 811 programs. Today's legislation reflects a compromise we have negotiated on proposals designed to expand housing opportunities for the elderly and persons with disabilities. These provisions reauthorize both programs through fiscal year 2003, permit the refinancing of program loans, permit for-profit limited partnerships, mixed funding sources, and certain commercial activities designed to increase the viability of elderly and disabled housing programs. The legislation also authorizes service coordinators and congregate services for elderly and disabled housing.

   Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I have been following the debate between the two Presidential candidates and notice that the Vice President wants to take full credit for paying down the deficit. At the time that the legislation went through the Congress, the President's proposal was a tax increase, and it was a proposal to increase spending in 1993. 
   I served on the Budget Committee in the House and I expressed at that time in reality this was not a tax to cut the deficit; it was a tax to increase spending. As members of the House Budget Committee, we had pointed out at that time that it was going to create a $2 billion deficit as far as the mind's eye could see. 
   So now we have the Vice President on the campaign trail taking credit for having eliminated the deficit. In reality, what it was, it was the Republican Congress. In 1993, when this was passed, Democrats controlled the Senate, Democrats controlled the House, and Democrats were in control of the Presidency. This passed by a very narrow margin in the House. Not one Republican voted for it. It came over to the Senate and would not have passed the Senate if at that time the Vice President, AL GORE, had not voted for the budget proposal which, in effect, was going to maintain the deficit at $200 billion. 
   So I wanted to bring some facts to the floor in that regard. I thought it was important I do that. 
   This year, in July, just before we were ready to adjourn, the assistant minority leader pointed out that I made a comment at one time and my comment was, about the President's plan in 1992, which we were voting on:  
   In summary, the plan has a fatal flaw--it does not reduce the deficit.  
   Today I am standing up on the Senate floor to stand by my remarks because, if we look historically, that plan did not reduce the deficit. In fact, I repeat, AL GORE's record is that of a tax hike because he is the one who voted for this--his vote alone. AL GORE would like to have you believe that actually what he was doing was putting in place a plan to eliminate the deficit. 
   I point out there is no document in the Clinton-Gore administration that exists that shows the largest tax hike--and that is what this was--the largest tax hike in American history did, or would have, or could ever have balanced the budget--not one document. 
   I have here before me ``A Vision of Change For America.'' This is dated February 17, 1993. This is the President's plan on how he was going to eliminate the deficit. If we look at that, on page 22 of that document, we see the projected deficit 5 years out, from 1993, is $241 billion, despite all the rhetoric and how it is going to pay down the deficit with the tax increase. 
   Then, in September of the same year, in 1993, if we look on page 34 of the ``Mid-Session Review'' of the 1994 budget, we see the projected deficit out to 1998 is $181 billion. 
   Then, if we look at the budget of the U.S. Government proposed for 1995, proposed in 1994, again, on page 13 of that particular document we see the projected deficit, 5 years out from the date of that document, is $181 billion again. It is flat-lining out at approximately $200 billion a year. 
   Then we have another document that was published in 1994, the ``Mid-Session Review'' of the 1995 budget. On page 3 of that document, it shows that the deficit, 5 years out from that date, is projected to be $207 billion. This is deficit spending. This is where you are going in, on any one fiscal year, and you are spending more than what you bring in, in revenues. 
   Then, following out through the first couple of years since his proposal, we look at the document, ``The Budget Of The U.S. Government, Fiscal Year 1996.'' If we look on page 2 of that particular document, we see the projected deficit for the year 2000, 5 years out, was $194 billion. 
   Then, in the Mid-Session Review on that particular budget, Mid-Session Review of the 1996 budget, we see the projected deficit 5 years out on that document is $235 billion in 2005. 
   If you recall, in 1996 we had the Republican Congress 
   elected. Under pressure from the Republicans in the Congress, the President finally admitted that his plan was not going to eliminate the deficit. So, in working with the Republican Congress, a new plan was beginning to be put in place. That is what this chart reflects. It reflects two things. The red part is this projected deficit that was passed by the President and the Congress and put into law. As we can see, it is about $200 billion deficit spending. This is a tax increase, the largest tax increase in the history of this country. 
   Then we see the Republicans come into power in 1996, and what happens, which is reflected by this black line, is that the deficits dramatically are reduced, and then we find, a little past 1997, actually we are beginning to get some surpluses until where we are at 2000, where we have the huge surpluses we are dealing with today. 
   I think the wrong person is taking credit for this. It is the Republican Congress that made a difference on deficit spending. It was not the largest tax increase in the history of this country which was passed in the Senate, here, by the Vice President. So this is a summary of what happened 2 years after the largest tax hike in history. Finally, Clinton and GORE admitted America was still 10 years away and almost $1 trillion short of a balanced budget. 
   It is not just their documents I demonstrated with on the floor of the Senate. In their own words, they verify this. During the signing ceremony on the largest tax hike in history, not a word was uttered by President Clinton about balancing the budget or saving Social Security or paying off the national debt. At that time, the Republican plan was we really needed to have dramatic changes if we were going to make a difference in saving Social Security, eliminating the deficit, and paying down the debt. But all the plan we got out of AL GORE and the administration was that we increased taxes and we would eliminate the deficit, and it was not working because they also increased spending. 
   If we look at the President's comments at the signing of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993, on August 10 of 1993--this is from a book entitled ``Public Papers of the President, William J. Clinton,'' 1993, volume 2, page 1355. If you read through his comments and examine his remarks, not once was a word uttered about balancing the budget, saving Social Security, or even paying off the national debt. Thus, AL GORE's tax hike was actually no act of heroism. What it really was, was a tax-and-spend vote instead of a tax to end the deficit. 
   So I wanted to address that issue here on the floor of the Senate. 
   In summation, Mr. President, no Clinton-Gore budget document from February 13, 1993, through July 28, 1995, ever shows a balanced budget resulting from Mr. GORE's record tax hike. No Clinton-Gore budget document from February 13, 1993, through July 28, 1995, ever shows a Social Security surplus being saved from Mr. GORE's record tax hike. And no Clinton-Gore budget document from February 13, 1993, through July 28, 1995, ever shows debt reduction or elimination resulting from Mr. GORE's record tax hike. Yet AL GORE now claims and lectures as if he actually created this surplus. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Colorado for yielding me some time here. This is an important piece of legislation that my colleague has been working for. I rise in support of S. 2508, called the Colorado Ute Settlement Act Amendments of 2000. It has been worked on for some 18 years by my colleague, Senator BEN NIGHTHORSE CAMPBELL. I wish to take a few moments to commend everyone who has worked on behalf of this piece of legislation, and for their efforts to resolve this issue. 
   In Colorado, earlier this year--maybe it was last year--there was a group of us who did get together, Congressman MCINNIS, myself, we had Senator CAMPBELL, and Secretary of Interior Babbitt. 
   We got together what we called the great sand dunes conference. All four of us walked up on those great majestic sand dunes. We talked about the future of the great sand dunes, and we had a discussion about the Animas project. At that point, we had our staffs standing off on the far side. All of our supporters were wondering what the four of us were talking about. We were talking about common ground and how we could come to an agreement to get the Animas-La Plata project passed. It was a great opportunity my colleague took at that time to talk to the Secretary of Interior while he was breathing some of that fresh mountain air of Colorado and clearing his thinking a little bit, and that got things off to a good start. 
   This new legislation is a product of that meeting, and it reflects significant compromises and challenges we all faced in getting to this historical moment. 
   Growing up in rural Colorado and throughout my tenure as a public servant, it seems the Animas-La Plata conflict has endured. Every time water and water projects were discussed, the promises and unsettled claims to the Colorado Ute Indian tribes always persisted. 
   Now the time has come for the Federal Government to fulfill its obligations to the Ute Indian tribes and satisfy the water treaty. 
   The project was originally authorized in 1968 with the help of then-Congressman Wayne Aspinall, a good friend of the Allard family and former chairman of the House Interior Committee. I knew Mr. Aspinall. He served Colorado honorably. Over the past 32 years, since authorization, we have tried to get this project completed with bipartisan efforts by former Congressmen Ray Kogovsek and Mike Strang. Now, with the outstanding leadership of Senator CAMPBELL, who for 14 years has championed this project, I believe the end is near. After 132 years, the time has come for the United States to finally do the right thing and meet its treaty obligations. 
   I commend Senator CAMPBELL for his tireless efforts, from his days in the House of Representatives, to his current time in the Senate and through three different Presidential administrations, to fulfill our Nation's treaty obligations. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I have introduced S. 3213. I want to take a few moments to talk about this important piece of legislation for paying down the national debt. 
   As the 106th Congress comes to an end, I rise to make a few comments on the evolution of an issue of great concern to myself and to many Americans. The issue is the $5,661,548,045,674 national debt we had as of October 2, 2000. 
   In August of 1993, while serving in the House of Representatives, I introduced House Joint Resolution 251 with the support of a number of my colleagues. The intention of this resolution was to amend the Constitution of the United States to provide for budgetary reform by requiring the reduction of the deficit, a balanced Federal budget, and the repayment of the national debt. During my years in the House, I had the good fortune to work with many Republican colleagues who were committed to these fiscally sound and enormously important issues. 
   Today, a scant 7 years later, we are enjoying unsurpassed Federal budget surpluses and the many difficulties that accompany such prosperity. I am concerned that the running dialog in Washington is far too focused on today's spending, today's enormous Federal programs, today's immediate wants and needs. I am concerned that we are talking too much about spend today and not enough about the consequences of tomorrow. As we conclude the appropriations process, it is apparent that many Members of this body are eager to transform the Federal budget surplus into new Federal spending, creating more Federal programs that will begat future obligations. 
   I am primarily concerned that efforts to recklessly spend every nickel of the taxpayers' money will threaten the long-term fiscal health of our Nation, the Nation our children and grandchildren will inherit. The majority of my colleagues on this side of the aisle are focusing on returning the surplus to its rightful owners--the American people. 
   In recent months, the current administration has taken a hardline against tax cuts, making it clear that the President believes the Federal budget surplus belongs to Washington and not the hard-working men and women who send far more money to the Internal Revenue Service than they often save for retirement, college, or for buying a home. 
   I find it frustrating and the height of arrogance to assume that the Federal Government can do more with this money than the taxpayers. So many of my Republican colleagues have such a profound conviction regarding returning the money to the working man and woman that, in fact, they have been hesitant to engage in development of a comprehensive long-term debt repayment plan. 
   I have come to the floor before, and I will come to the floor again, to make clear what is required to manage the national debt in a comprehensive repayment strategy. The sheer enormity of the national debt demands such diligence. I admit that I have no desire to increase the growth of the Federal Government instead of paying down the debt. I am, as many of my colleagues, however, personally committed to cutting taxes. 
   I have come to the floor today for no other reason than to make one thing crystal clear: We can pay down the debt and cut taxes. It is not an either/or proposition. It takes planning, and it takes commitment. It takes a plan to repay the debt and a commitment to cut taxes and the discipline to refrain from pouring ever more money into newer or larger programs. 
   At the end of fiscal year 1999, the gross Federal budget 
   was $5,656,270,901,615 and at the end of fiscal year 2000, the gross Federal budget was $5,674,178,209,886. 
   Our past fiscal irresponsibilities have created this overwhelming mess, and an unpleasant task lies before us. For the health and well-being of our national economy and the future security of our young people, we must commit to the elimination of this debt. 
   The journey of 5 1/2 trillion miles begins with a single step. Early in the 106th Congress, I introduced the American Debt Repayment Act. A year  later, I followed that legislation with the American Social Security Protection and Debt Repayment Act. I believe each of these bills provided a sensible first step toward debt repayment and the 5 trillion steps to follow. 
   Both pieces of legislation suggested we treat the Federal debt just as every American treats the largest purchase they will ever make. That is their home. In February of this year, I came to the floor with my friends, GEORGE VOINOVICH, ROD GRAMS and MIKE ENZI, with an amortization schedule for debt repayment to be offered to the budget resolution. Just as any American home buyer would amortize the purchase of their home with a mortgage, we offered a dutiful and moderate restriction on Federal spending combined with a specific debt repayment schedule. Our amendment was defeated. I believe the chief reason for the defeat of the amendment was the fear of being locked into a long-term repayment plan that would prohibit future tax cuts. The July 2000 budget economic and outlook update by the Congressional Budget Office disputes this understandable fear. 
   According to the CBO, assuming spending is frozen at fiscal year 2000 levels, the next 10 years will yield an on-budget surplus of $3.4 trillion. If this Congress had exercised some discipline this year and appropriated within a freeze, the on-budget surplus in fiscal year 2001, which we have just begun, is projected to be $116 billion. 
   One criticism of the long-term debt amortization plan that I brought to the floor was that it would prevent tax cuts and tie the hands of appropriators by absorbing all of the surplus. My most recent plan simply dedicates $15 billion of on-budget surplus to debt repayment and adds $15 billion each year thereafter. The sum total after 10 years of structured debt repayment is $825 billion from on-budget surplus. 
   This repayment schedule would have left $2.6 trillion remaining for tax cuts and new spending over the next 10 years. 
   It is important to note that these numbers do not take into account the off-budget surplus created by Social Security. I have said on the floor many times before that paying down the national debt is one of the best ways to provide long-term fiscal stability to Social Security. 
   In the past, I proposed restricted use of the Social Security surplus to help pay down the debt. This not only provides for the future stability of Social Security by paying down the debt but protects Social Security money from Federal discretionary spending. 
   Social Security surplus money should be used for debt repayment only until such time as Congress can initiate sensible reform to preserve the long-term integrity of Social Security. Social Security reform has been a priority of this Congress, and we can act to reduce the debt and reform this important program in one commitment. 
   When the new Congress convenes in 2001, I intend to 
   continue to work with my colleagues on developing a sensible and concrete debt repayment plan. I am also interested in working with my colleagues on other innovative ways to reduce the national debt. Legislation was recently introduced in the House, and I am pleased to come to the floor today on behalf of myself and the Senator from Idaho, Mr. CRAPO, to introduce the Taxpayers Choice Debt Reduction Act. 
   Every year, millions of taxpaying Americans have the opportunity to designate on their tax form a $3 contribution to the Presidential Election Campaign Fund. This checkoff on all 1040 forms would allow for the taxpayers themselves to designate that $3, or $6 for joint filers, would be dedicated to a special Department of the Treasury account to pay down the national debt. 
   Checking the box on the tax document would not increase the amount of taxes to be paid, nor would it decrease any refund. Checking ``yes'' in this box would simply provide a directive from the taxpayer that 3 of the dollars they were paying in taxes be used solely to pay down the Nation's debt. Importantly, these funds would be beyond any money set aside by Congress for debt reduction. 
   In my annual town meetings around the State of Colorado, I often speak with my constituents over the enormous debt owed by this country. I can say with great confidence that this is an issue where the public desires action. It is my hope that with this legislation Congress will empower these concerned taxpayers to act on their impulse to eliminate the debt. 
   Before I yield the floor, I extend my thanks to all of my Senate colleagues who have expressed an interest in debt repayment during this Congress, particularly Senators VOINOVICH, ENZI, GRAMS of Minnesota, CRAPO, REID of Nevada, and FEINGOLD. I have enjoyed working with each of these Members over the course of the year as we have brought debt repayment amendments to the floor. I look forward to continuing to work on this important issue with my colleagues.

   Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, before I begin my statement regarding the conference report, I want to say that my heart goes out to the families of the crewman of the U.S.S. Cole in the Aden Gulf who were killed, injured, or are missing. Let it be said, that if this was a terrorist attack, the United States shall not allow this to stand without a strong response by the United States and no matter where these terrorists go, they will be found and they will be held accountable. 
   Now to the conference report, I want to thank Chairman WARNER for allowing me the opportunity to speak in strong support of this essential Defense authorization conference report which provides the needed resources for our men and women in the armed services. I believe this bill is a fitting tribute for those who served, are serving, and will serve in armed services in the future. 
   The Fiscal Year 2001 Defense Authorization Act conference report has been a bipartisan effort and for the second year in a row we have reversed the downward trend in defense spending by increasing this year's funding by $4.6 billion over the President's request, for a funding level of $309.9 billion. 
   As the Strategic Subcommittee chairman, I would like to point out a few key provisions in the subcommittee's jurisdiction, plus a few of keen interest to myself. 
   As has been the pattern over the last several years, we had to increase the funding for our ballistic missile and space programs. This bill increases the ballistic missile defense programs by $391.8 million, a very important increase of $78 million for military space research and development programs, an increase of $91.2 million for strategic nuclear delivery vehicle modernization, and $80.5 million increase for military intelligence programs. 
   Regarding a few specific items--an increase of $85.0 million the Airborne Laser Program which requires the Air Force to stay on the budgetary path for a 2003 lethal demonstration and a 2008 deployment; an increase of $10 million for the Space Based Laser Program; a $129 million increase for National Missile Defense risk reduction; an increase of $80 million for Navy Theater Wide; an extra $8 million for the Arrow System Improvement Program; and for the Tactical High Energy Program an increase of $15 million. 
   Beyond the budget items, there four very important legislative provisions I would like to point out. 
   First, the Secretary of Defense is required to conduct comprehensive review of our nuclear posture--the first major review since 1994. Second, the Secretary of Defense, in consultation with the Secretary of Energy, must develop a long range plan for the sustainment and modernization of the U.S. strategic nuclear forces. We are concerned that the Department does not have a long term vision beyond their current modernization efforts.  
   Third, in 2002, the Space-Based Infrared System Low or the SBIRS Low program will be transferred from the Air Force to the Ballistic Missile Defense Organization. And fourth, in order to assess an emerging threat, a commission has been established to assess the threats to the United States from an electromagnetic pulse attack. 
   This conference report also authorizes the activities at the Department of Energy in regards to their defense activities. In order to ensure that America's nuclear weapon stockpile is safe 
   and reliable and that our nuclear waste is managed responsibly, we have authorized $13 billion for Atomic Energy Defense activities at the Department of Energy. 
   However, unfortunately, DOE has had a few problem areas in keeping and protecting our nation's most valued nuclear secrets. That is why we established in the fiscal year 2000 authorization bill the National Nuclear Security Administration or the NNSA and this year's bill provides a total of $6.4 billion for the NNSA. This total includes $4.8 billion for weapons activities, $877.5 million for defense nonproliferation activities, and $695 million for naval reactors activities. 
   A priority for me is the timely and efficient cleanup and closure of formerly used DOE weapons facilities, such as Rocky Flats in my State of Colorado. This bill moves the cleanup and closure of these forward with strong funding lines and some key legislative provisions. For example, DOE believed it would be best if they moved all the security and safeguards funding into one line and into one office at the DOE Washington, DC, headquarters. The problem is that this would have taken the responsibility away from the people who are responsible for the safeguards and security at each individual site, plus would have removed the needed flexibility to manage the sites effectively. For instance, once the material requiring security are removed from Rocky Flats, the savings from the reduction of these security needs would then be used to accelerate the cleanup and closure at the site. That is one of the reasons why we have a provision which would keep the funding and responsibility at each Environmental Management site. 
   In regards to the workers at Department of Energy sites, we provide employee incentives for retention and separation of federal employees at closure project facilities. These incentives are needed in order to mitigate the anticipated high attrition rate of certain federal employees with critical skills. 
   Another key provision which is very important not just for the workers I know at Rocky Flats, but for workers throughout the DOE sites in the United States is the establishment of an employee compensation initiative for DOE employees who were injured, due to exposure to radiation, beryllium, or silica, as a result of their employment at DOE sites. These workers performed a unique, important, but sometimes thankless task, of producing and testing our nuclear weapons arsenal. 
   Finally, I would like to mention a few important highlights of the conference report outside of the Strategic Subcommittee. In last year's authorization bill, we enacted a much needed and deserved pay raise for our military personnel. This year's bill continues that progress with a 3.7-percent pay raise beginning January 1, 2001. Along with the last year's pay raise, we also made major retirement reforms, including a Thrift Savings Plan for our service personnel. After many delays at the Pentagon, this year's bill directs the Department to implement the Thrift Savings Plan, in order to allow our military to prepare for life after their military service is complete. 
   Let me finish with a provision that by no small measure is the most expensive but couldn't be more deserving for those who have served. Beyond the many changes we have made in the pharmacy benefit and extension of benefits for active duty family members, we provide a permanent comprehensive health care benefit for Medicare eligible military retirees. This has been a priority for this committee and Congress and I believe we are doing the right thing for our military retirees who have served and protected this Nation. 
   I want to thank Chairman WARNER for the opportunity to point out some of the highlights in the bill which the Strategic Subcommittee has oversight and to congratulate him and Senator LEVIN in the bipartisan way this bill was developed and ask that all Senators strongly support the Defense Authorization Conference Report. I also want to congratulate the chairman in the way he shepherded this conference report down the long arduous road this bill saw. 
   One of Congress' main responsibilities is to provide for the common defense of the United States and I am proud of what this bill provides for men and women in uniform. I see this bill as a tribute to the dedication and hard work of these young men and women. I ask for a strong vote on this bill in order to get that much needed and well deserved resources to our military personnel.

    Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I rise today to share with my colleagues a pair of statements I recently received from an exceptional young man in Colorado, Mr. Evan Todd of Littleton. Evan was one of the many unfortunate victims of the horrific shooting that took place at Columbine High School on April 20, 1999. Evan was the first student shot in the library at Columbine High School, and despite his injuries he assisted other students and administered first aid to a seriously wounded peer until emergency services could arrive. Evan, an active Boy Scout, was awarded the prestigious Boy Scouts of America Honor Medal for his inspiring actions. Still a Columbine student, Evan has dedicated a tremendous amount of time to speaking to other students and adults around the nation concerning the problems of youth violence and the cultural influences on American youth. I am honored that Evan took the time to write to me and I ask that a copy of Evan Todd's letter to his fellow Scouts and a copy of a speech he delivered at ``The Gathering,'' a meeting of victims of school violence, be printed in the RECORD.

   Mr. ALLARD. 
   Mr. President, I rise today, with Senator BEN NIGHTHORSE CAMPBELL, to introduce a very important piece of legislation for my state of Colorado and this nation--The Rocky Flats National Wildlife Refuge Act. My colleague, Representative MARK UDALL, is introducing companion legislation in the House cosponsored by the entire Colorado delegation. 
   Today we begin a new chapter in the history of Rocky Flats. This legislation will permanently designate the Rocky Flats Environmental Technology Site as a National Wildlife Refuge following the cleanup and closure of the site. It ensures that the Federal Government will retain full liability and ownership of this former nuclear weapons facility. This legislation will transform Rocky Flats from producing weapons to protecting wildlife. It will ensure that our children and grandchildren will be able to enjoy the wildlife and open space that currently exists at Rocky Flats. 
   This is a tremendous achievement. Once the bill is enacted, we will see Rocky Flats move from being an active nuclear weapons site into an active refuge for wildlife and wild flowers in less than two decades. An accomplishment which no one thought was possible. 
   My vested interest in Rocky Flats began during the 1980's when I was the  Chairman of the State Senate Committee on Health, Environment, Welfare and Institutions. Although I supported the national security mission of the Rocky Flats site prior to closure, I believe that the Department of Energy must also ensure the safety and health of all Coloradans and the environment. When the Rocky Flats site was shut down in 1990, cleaning up and closing down the site became one of my top legislative priorities and will remain so until this project is complete. 
   So where did the idea come from to turn Rocky Flats, a former nuclear weapons production facility, into a National Wildlife Refuge? 
   My experience with wildlife refuge designations began with Congresswoman Schroeder at the Rocky Mountain Arsenal in 1992. We worked on a bill very similar to the one we are here to discuss today, which designated the Arsenal as a National Wildlife Refuge. Given the success we experienced at the Rocky Mountain Arsenal, I am confident this is an appropriate designation for Rocky Flats. 
   Last year, I became the Strategic Subcommittee Chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, which has direct oversight of former DoE weapons facilities including Rocky Flats. This is the first site in the DoE complex to receive funding for cleanup and closure, and will therefore be a role model for other sites in the complex. As Chairman of the Subcommittee, I will continue to work closely with my colleagues to educate them on the importance of cleaning up and closing down Rocky Flats so it can be utilized as a National Wildlife Refuge. This education extends beyond the cleanup and closure of Rocky Flats to the importance of cleaning up and closing of all the former DoE weapons sites. 
   To this end, Congressman UDALL and I have worked in a bipartisan manner, with the Department of Energy, the EPA, the State of Colorado, the local governments and the Rocky Flats stakeholders to produce the proposed Rocky Flats National Wildlife Refuge Act. It has been hard work and with many discussion drafts, but in the end I believe we have produced a bill that the communities surrounding Rocky Flats can and will be proud of.

   Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I sat here and listened to my good friend from West Virginia on trade. I believe I should speak from a position of representing a State that has benefited immensely from the trade agreements that we have passed recently--the North American Free Trade Agreement and the General Agreement on Trade and Tariffs. 
   Exports from the State of Colorado, which I represent, have increased dramatically. In fact, we have experienced the greatest growth in exports of any State in the Nation on a percentage basis. The economy of the State of Colorado is based greatly on agriculture. My friend from West Virginia talked about agriculture to a certain degree. We grow a lot of wheat. We raise a lot of livestock, and we do make an attempt to expand our markets to the Pacific rim countries, which includes China. 
   We have a very modern economic base in the State. We work a lot on exporting high tech. Many high-tech companies do business in the State of Colorado. On a concentration basis, we have the highest concentration of high-tech employees of any State in the country. So we benefit from exporting goods, and the North American Free Trade Agreement has helped the State of Colorado, and GATT has also. 
   I happen to think that an agreement with China for normal trade relations will help agriculture, and it will help States such as Colorado because these are markets where we can compete and have been competing. 
   My colleague from West Virginia talked a considerable amount about the trade deficits we are experiencing in this country. I come at the trade deficit issue from a different perspective than my colleague from West Virginia. I have looked at what happened historically with trade deficits. If we look at the time of the Great Depression in this country, the trade deficits were low. If we look at the time when we were suffering, when we had the misery index--and this is at the latter part of the 1970s, during the Carter administration--the trade deficit was low. We had high double-digit unemployment. We had high double-digit inflation, and we had high double-digit unemployment. But our trade deficit was low. I happen to believe when we look at the trade deficit, it is more of a reflection of what is happening economically in this country. Our country has experienced high trade deficits when our economy has been doing well, just like during the period of time we are in today. 
   So the figures he presents to you on trade deficits, in reality, they do happen. What is the significance to the economy? I happen to believe it has the opposite impact. Many times, when people are evaluating the impact of the trade deficit, they look at it only from the perspective of one industry. If you look at the total economy, the total growth of jobs within this country, we benefit, in many cases, by importing products. 
   How does that work? Let's take an automobile, for example. Some State may have a company--maybe in Michigan, for example--that could be impacted by trade policies. But does that have a net impact on jobs in the United States? Many times, when you take it into total consideration, there is a net gain because there are jobs--union jobs--created when you have to unload those cars at our ports. There are jobs created when you have to clean up the cars when they come into the country. There are jobs created when you have to transport those cars across the country to get them to a point of sale. Somebody has to sell the cars. Jobs are created there. Somebody has to buy the cars. There is insurance sold in relation to the purchase of the car. Goods and services relating to that go into the marketplace. Those cars have to be maintained and operated and fixed. Many times, they go into a resale market 
   at some point in their lifetime. 
   These are all jobs that are created as a result of having imported that product. So I am convinced that our best policy is to work in a free market environment, and the problem we have right now is not that we don't place a lot of the tariffs and restrictions on Chinese goods coming into this country, but China is the one that is placing restrictions on our goods going into their country--particularly agricultural products and goods related to the high-tech industry. That is why I think this particular effort to create normal trade relations is beneficial. Isolationism doesn't work. Isolating a country and saying that is going to help human rights--I don't think that works. That is one reason why Taiwan, for example, supports our efforts to try to establish permanent normal trade relations with China. 
   So I think that in order to prevent human abuse, to protect human rights, we need to open up China. When our business people go into China, they expect a certain standard. They just won't do business with Chinese companies without those standards. They will have to abide by their contracts. If somebody doesn't honor the contract, there has to be a court system of some type that will help enforce those contracts. And these all carry with them democratic principles. 
   When Chinese businessmen interact with American businessmen, they will understand how the free enterprise system works, how democracy works. I think we export democracy when we enter into a free market agreement where we take down trade barriers and increase the interaction between countries--particularly when we are talking about a democratic county as opposed to a Communist one. They see there is a different way of doing things and prospering that yields benefits far and above what they have been told in a country where the leaders restrict information and restrict freedoms. 
   I think it is important we pass this piece of legislation that says we will have permanent normal trade relations with China. 
   I see my colleague from North Carolina.

    Mr. ALLARD. Madam President, I rise today to pay tribute to my friend, Thurman ``Fum'' McGraw, a man whose legend at Colorado State University, my alma mater, is among the greatest in the University's history. ``Fum,'' the school's first All-American, died Wednesday at age 73 of complications from a stroke this summer. 
   ``Fum,'' who was large in stature at nearly 6-foot-5 and more than 200 pounds, was considered Colorado State University's greatest athlete, and as a ``gentle giant'' by his wife, Brownie. McGraw became synonymous with the school's athletic department. In addition to his superior college football career, a two time All-American defensive lineman in 1948 and 1949 who led the Rams to their first Bowl game, he was also an All-American in wrestling and competed in the national track and field championships. As a senior in 1949-1950 he was the university's student body president. He graduated with a degree in forest management in 1950 and spent five years in the National Football League. After an amazing college career he starred with the National Football League's Detroit Lions, helping them to win two championships and earning All-Pro honors three times as a defensive lineman. 
   ``Fum'' returned to CSU in 1955 as the wrestling coach, also assisting with the football and track teams. He was an assistant coach with the Pittsburgh Steelers from 1958-62, returned to CSU as an administrator in 1962, then returned to the NFL as a scout in 1970. Finally in 1976 he was back to stay at CSU as the athletic director until 1986. Throughout his career at Colorado State University McGraw tirelessly raised money for the CSU athletic department. He spearheaded the resumption of the football series with the University of Colorado and helped initiate the construction of Moby Arena in 1966 and Hughes Stadium in 1968. His work ultimately led to the school's acceptance into the Western Athletic Conference in 1968. But it wasn't just what he did in athletics that made him so special. 
   Thurman McGraw was the recipient of numerous honors, including induction into the National Football Foundation Hall of Fame and the Colorado Sports Hall of Fame. In 1997 he and his wife received the Citizen of the West Award given annually by the National Western Stock Show. ``Fum'' also led the effort to name the university track for his former teammate and friend Jack Christiansen. Last year to honor McGraw, CSU officials commemorated his lifetime of support by dedicating the Thurman ``Fum'' McGraw Center. The Thurman ``Fum'' McGraw Center which includes the school's locker rooms, weight training and injury rehabilitation facilities, and coaches and staff offices for the athletic department. Two weeks ago, while ``Fum'' was laid up in the hospital, the football team dedicated its game against in state rival University of Colorado to McGraw. The Rams upset Colorado 28 to 24. 
   McGraw would do anything to help the school he adored, the friends he cared so much for, and the family he loved so dearly. Thurman ``Fum'' McGraw was and always will remain the essence of Colorado State University. He was a hero on and off the field, and a genuine role model for today's athletes. He will be missed throughout the community, but he will not be forgotten. I offer my thoughts and prayers to those close to Mr. McGraw in this difficult time.

   Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, recently, President Clinton vetoed legislation that would have repealed the estate tax, legislation that I strongly supported. I fundamentally oppose the estate tax. I call it the ``death tax.'' This has been a concern of mine for some time now. In fact, I have previously introduced legislation that would do away with this unfair tax. 
   Congress has clearly demonstrated its support for easing this burden. The  Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 gradually increases the exemption. Last year, Congress decided that further action was needed and passed a bill that would have eliminated the federal estate tax. Unfortunately, the President chose to veto that bill. 
   The United States has one of the highest estate taxes in the world. While income tax rates have declined in recent decades, estate taxes have remained high. Today, the death tax is imposed on estates with assets of more than $675,000. The rates begin at 37% and very rapidly rise to 55%. Some estates even pay a marginal rate of 60%! 
   This issue really hits home for me. Family farms and small businesses are two of the groups most affected by the estate tax. I grew up on my family's farm in Colorado, and I owned a small business before I came to Washington. So, I truly understand the concerns of those who live in fear of the impact that this tax will have on their legacy to their children. 
   The estate tax has resulted in the loss of family farms and family businesses across the nation. Many people work their entire lives to build a business that they can pass on to their children. When these hard-working businessmen and farmers pass away, their families are often forced to sell off the business to pay the estate tax. I see this as an affront to those who try to pass on the fruits of their lives' work to their children. 
   The people affected by this tax are not necessarily wealthy. Many small businesspeople are cash poor, but asset rich. For example, the owner of a small restaurant might have $800,000 of assets, but not much cash on hand. Her children will still have to pay an excessive tax on the assets. The beer wholesaler, who has invested all of his revenue in trucks and storage, might have more than $675,000 in assets. That does not make him a cash-wealthy man. Yet, he is still subject to this so-called ``tax on the wealthy.'' 
   The death tax also impacts employment and the economy. When a family-owned farm or a small business closes, the workers lose their jobs. Conversely, leaving resources in the economy can create jobs. A recent George Mason study found that if the estate tax were phased out over five years, the economy would create 198,895 more jobs, and grow by an additional $509 billion over a ten-year period. 
   Additionally, the estate tax is a disincentive for Americans to save their earnings. The government has created a number of tax breaks and other incentives for those who save their money: 401(k)s and IRA's--to name a few. Yet, the estate tax sends a contradictory message. Basically, it says, ``If you don't spend all your savings by the time you die, the government will penalize you.'' This tax is no small penalty, either. We are talking about some very high tax rates. 
   The death tax also represents an unjust double taxation. The savings were taxed initially when they were earned. Then, when the saver passes away, the government comes along and takes a second cut. There is no good reason for the current system--other than the government's desire to make a profit at the already trying time of the death of a dear one. 
   The current death tax law has a greater effect on the lower end of the scale than the higher. Wealthy people can afford lawyers and planners to help them plan their estate. Those at the lower end of the estate tax scale are often unable to afford sophisticated estate planning. So the current law also makes the tax somewhat regressive, which is not fair. 
   Planning and compliance with the estate tax can consume substantial resources. In 1995, the Gallup organization surveyed family firms. Twenty-three percent of owners of companies valued over $10 million said that they pay more than $50,000 per year in insurance premiums on policies to help them pay the eventual bill. To plan for the estate tax, the firms also spent an average of $33,000 on lawyers, accountants and financial planners, over a period of several years. This is money that could have been better spent to expand the business and create new jobs--rather than dealing with the death tax. 
   The estate tax only raises one percent of federal revenue, yet it costs farms, businesses and jobs. No American family should lose their farm or business because of the federal government. I support full repeal of the federal estate tax.

   Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I know my colleague from Wisconsin has been here before me. I have been asked by the majority leader to make a unanimous consent request. As soon as I make it, I hope the Chair will recognize my colleague from Wisconsin. 
   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that there be 30 minutes equally divided for debate relative to the Feingold amendment regarding a commission, with no second-degree amendments in order prior to the vote. 
   I further ask consent that following that debate, Senator WELLSTONE be recognized in order to resume debate on amendment No. 4120. 
   I further ask consent that following the use or yielding of that debate time, the Senate proceed to a series of rollcall votes in relation to the following amendments, with 2 minutes for closing remarks prior to each vote. Those amendments are as follows: Helms amendment No. 4128; Helms amendment No. 4123; a Feingold amendment regarding a commission; Wellstone amendment No. 4120.

   Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, the Republican floor manager has indicated I could use his time to talk about this important piece of legislation. I don't have any remarks I am going to direct specifically to the amendment; although, I find myself in the same position as the Senator from New Mexico, Mr. DOMENICI, in that there are many amendments that, under different circumstances, I may very well have found myself supporting. 
   But because I think this is such an important piece of legislation, I have decided to oppose any amendments that will be made to this bill because I think it will put it in jeopardy, and the chances of it passing the House are, from what I understand, not good if we put Senate amendments on this side. 
   I think we will have an opportunity in the future to address some of the amendments that were attempted to be made to this particular piece of legislation. Under those circumstances, as I mentioned earlier, I will probably support them. 
   I think this is a very important piece of legislation for this country. It is a very important piece of legislation as far as the State of Colorado is concerned. The State of Colorado has experienced tremendous growth in exports, and I attribute that to the type of industry we have in the State of Colorado. We are primarily agriculture and light manufacturing, which includes high-technology. Those are areas where we have had a lot of growth in exports nationwide. Colorado has been the benefactor of that. 
   I have come to the belief that we need to work to open trade barriers. When we open these trade barriers, democracy is exported and we prosper economically. Colorado would be one State in the Nation that would be a good example of that. 
   Western civilization has been trading in some manner with China since the Roman Empire anchored one end of the Silk Road. But it will not be until we pass this bill before us that our culture will have access to free and open trade with this massive country called China. 
   I am glad most of us have recognized that the term ``most favored nation'' was a misnomer. This country needs to remember that China will not actually be ``favored.'' China will be equally treated as we treat the other 137 World Trade Organization countries such as Cyprus, Jamaica, and Djibouti, or the newest WTO member nation, Albania. We are not singling China out for special treatment, nor are we ushering them into the community of nations. The World Trade Organization exists separate from our decision. 
   I am struck most by this fact: That if the United States does not pass permanent normal trading relations, it does not keep China out of the WTO. It just keeps America from benefiting from China's presence in it. 
   China has 1.3 billion people, a purchasing power of $4.42 trillion, and a yearly import market of $140 billion. Nearly 20 percent of the world lives within its borders--a fifth of the world. And many of the Chinese people are just beginning to desire Western products such as those made in Colorado--luxury goods, communication gear, computers, software, western beef, wheat, and so much more. The rest of the world is scrambling ferociously to pass their own version of PNTR to capture the China market. 
   If we turn down this opportunity or if we amend it into practical nullification, we will not stop China's human rights problems; we will not force China to accept freedom of religion, speech, or other individual liberty. All that will happen is the United States will be denied the loosening of tariffs and import controls that the rest of the world nations will gain. 
   If Congress balks at PNTR this year, 137 nations other than the United States will benefit from free trade with China while American workers, farmers, ranchers, and small businesses are denied equal access. 
   Everyone knows we trade with China now. Colorado exported $166 million worth of goods to China in 1998. Colorado Springs alone, one of our larger metropolitan areas, exported $41 million. Denver, another of our larger metropolitan areas, exported $16 million to China. And these numbers are only going to grow. If we grant China PNTR, Colorado will be assured a more prosperous future. Why? Because with PNTR-WTO membership, China will have to lower their average tariffs on U.S. goods from 24 percent to 9 percent. They will have to cut average agricultural tariffs in half and eliminate all tariffs on high-tech goods. But Colorado and the United States will not have to undergo similar market restructuring. The United States already has open markets and engages in free trade. 
   It is China that will have to open their markets and end their protectionism to benefit from WTO membership. This will then facilitate more trade and higher profits for Colorado companies and Colorado workers. 
   Why is China doing this? Because they know what we do. Free trade benefits those who practice it. 
   Many export producing jobs pay better than basic service sector jobs. Increasing trade generates more jobs of a higher quality, and that presents more opportunities for workers.  
   For instance, since NAFTA, Colorado has increased exports to Mexico by $300 million. China PNTR will add to this export total. 
   If we were to set aside economic reasons, there are still many other reasons to favor PNTR. The first is humanitarian. 
   History has shown that it is the isolated, closed societies that are the most brutal and repressed. International contact--such as would be brought about by increased trade, with businessmen, foreign goods, exchanges, corporate presence and marketing--would serve to increase access to a higher standard of living and a better quality of life. 
   We would be able to up-grade the everyday lifestyle of the ordinary people of China, and that is not an opportunity to be ignored by those who seek to aid the world's less fortunate. 
   The number one export from America is democracy. 
   PNTR will not only tear down the trade barriers for Colorado's workers, farmers, and small businesses, it will also flood the Chinese culture with the American ideals of liberty and democracy. 
   When the freedom protesters took over Tiananmen Square in 1889 and built a replica of the Statute of Liberty, they were not just expressing support for the type of freedoms enshrined in our political documents. 
   They were expressing a desire for the liberty and benefits of a modern, vibrant, and free United States that they saw on the current world stage. 
   By increasing our relations with China, we can side step the admittedly authoritarian regime in Beijing, and deal with the people themselves through our products and our communications. 
   The Soviet Union did not fall because we passed resolutions against them. It did not fall because we had bitter debates about their human right records, and it did not fall because we regularly reviewed their civil liberties. 
   It fell for two reasons that remain relevant today: The Soviet Union fell because the oppressed people of Eastern Europe grew tired of being left behind by the western prosperity they saw, and because their leaders realized that President Reagan would not let them take that prosperity by force. Unable to keep up with the western nations, they fell behind and eventually fell apart. 
   We need to remain aware of and secure against 
   China's sometimes blatant hostility to us and our ideals. But we have less to fear from a China that shares an engaged, mutually beneficial relationship than from an excluded China shut out of our markets. 
   Taiwan, the nation most under the gun from an aggressive China, supports Chinese PNTR/WTO membership for this very reason. It suggests that they too hope that increased trade will overwhelm the communist system and force it to grow and develop into a more mature, efficient, and equitable system. 
   Some oppose trade agreements because of security concerns. Trade agreements are not the reason for the loss of our nation's military secrets. 
   We have seen serious security lapses in the Department of State, Department of Defense, Department of Energy, and our national laboratories. The responsibility of protecting our national secrets lies with the Administration, not our trade policies. 
   The most recent Department of Energy security blunder, losing two hard drives, coupled with the discovery of bugging devices in State Department conference rooms and the mishandling of classified information by the recently dismissed Director of the Central Intelligence Agency, builds a very strong case for this administration's blatant disregard for protecting our national security secrets. 
   However, these wrongs pale in comparison to the Secretary of Energy's decision to ignore the public law enacted by Congress last year to establish a semi-autonomous National Nuclear Security Agency to correct known security deficiencies within his department. 
   Fortunately, the recent Los Alamos incident expedited what had become a stalled effort to confirm General John Gordon as Director of the newly formed NNSA. With General Gordon in place, I sincerely believe we will finally get some action to hasten security reform within this agency. 
   But these acts, all pre-PNTR, highlight a simple truth--weapons proliferation, national security, and defense are functions of a nation's leaders, not its merchants. 
   If we want a strong, pro-active national defense that diligently maintains our vital interests, we can not expect to let trade agreements alone shoulder that burden. 
   It is my hope that the upcoming vote will confirm America's commitment to free trade, international participation, and mutually beneficial capitalism. That is why I will be voting in favor of China PNTR and against any amendments. 
   I yield the remainder of my time.

   Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, today the Senate will resume postcloture debate on the motion to proceed to the China PNTR legislation. It is hoped an agreement can be reached to begin debate on the substance of the bill during today's session of the Senate. The Senate will also continue debate on the energy and water appropriations bill during this evening's session. The Schumer amendment regarding an energy commission is the pending amendment. 
   By previous consent, during today's consideration of the energy and water appropriations bill, Senator DASCHLE, or his designee, will be recognized to offer a motion to strike the language relating to the Missouri River. There will be up to 3 hours of debate on the amendment prior to a vote in relation to the motion; therefore, votes could occur into the evening. 
   I thank my colleagues for their attention.

   Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, as we today welcome Senator COVERDELL's successor, I wanted to talk about the man whose shoes he must fill. 
   Last week the Atlanta Journal Constitution's tribute article to our late friend PAUL COVERDELL included the following story. Once, at a county fair on a hot summer day, someone asked PAUL why he was wearing a coat and tie in such a casual setting. PAUL replied that he had noticed that in an emergency, when people are trying to figure out what to do, they always go to the guy with the tie on. 
   Well, tie or not, Senator COVERDELL was a guy whom we always went to. 
   I, like many of us on both sides of the aisle, considered him a friend. His hand and arm gestures will always be remembered as ``get up and go'' signs. I had the privilege of lunching with PAUL nearly every Wednesday for the last several years and his presence there was a treat. 
   He was a hard worker. He knew where he wanted to go. And he was willing to help those with whom he teamed on issues--issues that were invariably important and meaningful. I checked last night, and there are 103 pieces of legislation listed as sponsored by Senator COVERDELL. 
   Now, PAUL did work on parochial legislation for his state, and he had his share of technical bills, but he also authored many significant and far-reaching national provisions. He worked for the country as well as Georgia, and strove to improve the education, the safety, and the prospects of our children specifically and our citizenry generally. 
   He had an IRS reform bill, the Safe and Affordable Schools Act, Education IRA's, anti-drug legislation ..... and then there are the countless hours spent working on bills for his colleagues and conference. Even his commemorative bills were significant--Reagan Washington National Airport for example, a bill I jumped to co-sponsor. 
   He had 30 productive years of service to his country--army postings in Asia, Georgia State Senate, Peace Corps Director, and an invaluable Member of the United States Senate. I was proud to be his friend and colleague. I will miss my friend from Georgia.

   Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, today I am introducing the ``Local Housing Opportunities Act'', legislation to empower communities and individuals by consolidating and reforming HUD programs. I ask unanimous consent that the following section-by-section description of the bill be printed in the RECORD and that the text of the bill be printed in the RECORD following the description. 
   In 1994, there were 240 separate programs at the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). By 1997, the number of programs had grown to 328. Many of these programs have never been authorized by Congress, and operate under questionable legal authority. While the number of HUD programs has grown, HUD's workforce has declined from 12,000 employees in 1995 to 9,000 employees today. As a result, scarce resources are diverted away from core housing and enforcement programs, dramatically increasing the risks of mismanagement and fraud. HUD remains the only Cabinet level agency designated by the General Accounting Office (GAO) as ``High Risk''. In order to promote the interests of taxpayers and improve the delivery of services to beneficiaries, Congress should transfer more programs to  the States and localities and enact legislation to consolidate, terminate, and streamline HUD programs. 
   Section-by-Section Description 
   I. Prohibition of Unauthorized Programs at the Department of Housing and Urban Development--Prohibits HUD from carrying out any program that is not explicitly authorized in statute by the Congress. This provision takes effect one year after the effective date to give the Congress sufficient time to authorize those programs that it wishes to maintain. Within 60 days of the date of enactment the Department of Housing and Urban Development shall provide a report detailing every HUD program along with the statutory authorization for that program. This report shall be provided annually to the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs, the Senate Subcommittee on Housing and Transportation, the House Committee on Banking and Financial Services, and the House Subcommittee on Housing and Community Opportunity. 
   II. Elimination of Certain HUD Programs--Terminates certain programs as recommended by the HUD Secretary in the ``HUD 2020 Program Repeal and Streamlining Act''. The Department has determined that these programs are unnecessary, outdated, or inactive. 
   Community Investment Corporation Demonstration--never funded, superseded by the Community Development Financial Institutions program administered by the Department of the Treasury. 
   New Towns Demonstration Program for Emergency Relief of Los Angeles--not funded since FY 1993. 
   Solar Assistance Financing Entity--not funded in recent years. 
   Urban Development Action Grants--discontinued program, not funded in recent years. 
   Certain Special Purpose Grants--not funded since FY 1993 and FY 1995. 
   Moderate Rehabilitation Assistance in Disasters--no additional assistance for the Moderate Rehabilitation program has been provided (other than for the homeless under the McKinney Act) since FY 1989. 
   Rent Supplement Program--not funded for many years. 
   National Home Ownership Trust Demonstration--authority expired at the end of FY 1994. 
   Repeal of HOPE I, II, and III--all HOPE funds have been awarded, no additional funding has been requested since FY 1995, and no future funding is anticipated. 
   Energy Efficiency Demonstration Program, section 961 of NAHA--never funded. 
   Technical Assistance and Training for IHAs--no funds have been provided for this program since FY 1994. 
   Termination of the investor mortgages portion of the Section 203(k) rehabilitation mortgage insurance program as recommended by the HUD IG. Investor rehabilitation mortgages constitute approximately 20% of the loans insured under this program, and recent IG audits have found this portion of the program to be particularly vulnerable to fraud and abuse by investor-owners. The larger portion of the program for owner/occupants is retained. 
   Certificate and Voucher Assistance for Rental Rehabilitation Projects--rental rehabilitation program has been repealed, section 289 of NAHA. 
   Single Family Loan Insurance for Home Improvement Loans in Urban Renewal Areas--unnecessary. 
   Single Family and Multifamily Mortgage Insurance for Miscellaneous Special Situations, section 223 (a)(1)-(6) and (8)--obsolete. 
   Single Family Mortgage Insurance for so-called ``Modified'' Graduated Payment Mortgages, section 245 (b)--insurance authority terminated in 1987 but provision never repealed. 
   War Housing Insurance--authority for new insurance terminated in 1954, but provision never repealed. 
   Insurance for Investments (Yield Insurance)--program never implemented, but authority and provision never repealed. 
   National Defense Housing--authority for new insurance terminated in 1954, but provision never repealed. 
   Rural Homeless Housing Assistance--not funded since FY 1994, all HUD homeless assistance will be part of the McKinney Homeless Assistance Performance Fund created under this legislation. 
   Innovative Homeless Initiatives Demonstration--not funded since FY 1995, all HUD homeless assistance will be part of the McKinney Homeless Assistance Performance Fund created under this legislation. 
   During the remainder of 2000, the Senate Housing and Transportation Subcommittee will hold hearings on this discussion draft. At that time the Subcommittee will solicit the recommendations of the Department, the IG, the GAO, and other organizations for other HUD programs that can be streamlined or eliminated. This legislation also provides for the creation of a ``HUD Consolidation Task Force'' which will report to the Congress with recommendations on how to reduce the number of programs at HUD through consolidation, termination, or transfer to other levels of government. 
   III. HUD Consolidation Task Force--Mandates the creation of a task force that will focus exclusively on legislative and regulatory options to reduce the number of HUD programs. The task force will consist of three individuals: the Comptroller General of the United States, the HUD Secretary, and the HUD Inspector General. Within six months of the enactment of this legislation, the task force will produce a report outlining options to reduce the number of HUD programs through consolidation, elimination, and transfer to other levels of government. The report will be provided to the Senate and House Housing Subcommittees as well as the Senate and House Banking Committees. 
   I. Community Development Block Grant Authorization (CDBG) and Prohibition of Set-Asides and Earmarks--Restores local control over the CDBG program by prohibiting Congressional set-asides and earmarks not specifically authorized in statute. The original intent of CDBG was that program dollars would be allocated directly to cities and states according to formula. In FY 1999 over 10 percent of the funds were earmarked for specific projects (the earmarks have increased steadily in recent years). CDBG was last authorized in 1994, this legislation would authorize the program through FY 2005, with an initial authorization of $4,850,000,000 in FY 2001. 
   II. Community Notification of Opt-Outs--Requires that when HUD receives notice of a Section 8 opt-out that it forward that notice within 10 days to the top elected official for the unit of local government where the property is located. This supplements the requirement in Section 8 (c)(8)(A) of the Housing Act of 1937 that HUD and tenants be notified one year in advance if a Section 8 opt-out is anticipated. 
   III. Urban Homestead Requirement--Directs that HUD-held properties that have not been disposed of within six months following acquisition by HUD or a determination that they are substandard or unoccupied, shall be made available upon written request for sale or donation to local governments or Community Development Corporations (CDCs). 
   IV. Permanent ``Moving To Work'' Authorization--Continues the deregulation of Public Housing Authorities (PHAs) by opening the ``Moving To Work'' program to all PHAs. This program was authorized as a demonstration in the 1996 VA/HUD Appropriation bill and granted up to 30 PHAs the option to receive HUD funds as a block grant. The program provides autonomy from HUD micro-management and the freedom to innovate with reforms such as work requirements, time limits, job training, and Home ownership assistance. The Secretary shall approve an application under this program for all but the lowest performing PHAs unless the Secretary makes a written determination, within 60 days after receiving the application, that the application fails to comply with the statutory provisions authorizing the ``Moving to Work'' program. 
   Consolidate HUD Homeless Assistance Funds into the ``McKinney Homeless Assistance Performance Fund''--Combines HUD's McKinney programs (Supportive Housing Program, Shelter Plus Care, Section 8 Moderate Rehabilitation for Single Room Occupancy Dwellings, Safe Havens, Rural Homeless Housing Assistance, and the Emergency Shelter Grants), into a single McKinney Homeless Assistance Performance Fund ( and authorizes funding through FY 2003, at an initial level of $1,050,000,000 in FY 2001). Distributes funds according to the CDBG block grant formula with 70 percent to units of local government and 30 percent to states. 
   Eligible units of local government include metropolitan cities, urban counties, and consortia. The formula is to be reviewed after one year with a statutory requirement that HUD provide alternative formulas for the Congress to consider. State funds are available for use in areas throughout the entire state. Codifies and requires a Continuum of Care system by grant recipients. The Continuum of Care submission is linked with the Consolidated Plan. Every three dollars of federal block grant money is to be matched with one dollar of state or local money. Funds qualifying for the match are the same as those currently permitted under the Emergency Shelter Grants program, and would include salaries paid to staff, volunteer labor, and the value of a lease on a building. There is a five year transition period--state and local governments would receive no less than 90 percent of prior award amounts (average for FY 96-99) in the first year after enactment, 85 percent in the second year after enactment, 80 percent in the third and fourth year after enactment, and 75 percent in the fifth year after enactment. Eligible projects and activities include emergency assistance, safe haven housing, transitional housing, permanent housing, supportive services for persons with disabilities, single room occupancy housing, prevention, outreach and assessment, acquisition and rehabilitation of property, new construction, operating costs, leasing, tenant assistance, supportive services, administrative (generally limited to 10 percent of funds), capacity building, targeting to subpopulations of persons with disabilities. Performance measures and benchmarks are included, along with periodic performance reports, reviews, and audits. 
   I. Mutual and Self-Help Housing Technical Assistance and Training Grants Program--Reauthorizes technical assistance grants to facilitate the construction of self-help housing in rural areas. Program beneficiaries are required to contribute a significant amount of sweat equity to the construction of the homes that they will own. Authorizes funding of $40 million for FY 2001 and 2002, and $45 million for FY 2003-2005. 
   II. Improve the Rural Housing Repair Loan Program for the Elderly--Increases the amount for which a promissory note is considered a sufficient security for housing repairs from $2,500 to $7,500.  
   III. Enhance Efficiency of Rural Housing Preservation Grants--Eliminates the existing statutory requirement that prohibits a State from obligating more than 50 percent of its Housing Preservation Grants allocation to any one grantee. Many states receive only a small amount from this formula program. In many cases the money can only be most effectively invested in one project. 
   IV. Project Accounting Records and Practices--Requires section 515 rural housing borrowers to maintain records in accordance with GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles). 
   V. Operating Assistance for Migrant Farmworker Projects Authority--Permits rural housing operating assistance payments in migrant and seasonal farm labor housing complexes. 
   I. Authorization of Appropriations for Rental Vouchers for Relocation of Witnesses and Victims of Crime--Authorizes specific funding for vouchers for victims and witnesses of crime. These vouchers were authorized in the Quality Housing and Work Responsibility Act of 1998 (QHWRA). No funds have yet been appropriated and HUD has yet to write regulations. The current authorization directs the Secretary to make available such sums as may be necessary for the relocation of families residing in public housing who are victims of a crime of violence reported to an appropriate law enforcement authority, and requires that PHAs notify tenants of the availability of such funds. This legislation would authorize a funding level in each of FY 2001-2005 of $25,000,000. 
   II. Revise the HUD Lease Addendum--Prohibits the HUD lease addendum from overriding local law. Participating housing providers and residents sign a three-party lease along with the public housing authority. The law requires the attachment of a HUD Lease Addendum (HUD Form 52647.3) which overrides some local market provisions and practices, holding the voucher resident to a non-standard lease contract. The use of federally promulgated forms that counter local practice incurs additional training, legal and management costs. The voucher lease addendum shall be nullified to the extent that it conflicts with State or local law. 
   III. Reduce the Burden of Housing Quality Standard Inspections--Provides the option that Housing Quality Standard inspections be conducted on a property basis rather than a unit basis. Currently each individual unit that is rented under the program must be inspected for compliance with HUD's Housing Quality Standards. Individual inspections are a time-consuming administrative headache for PHAs and Section 8 landlords, result in slow unit turnover, and significant lost revenue. This legislation provides the Section 8 landlord with the option to have annual inspections conducted on a property or building basis, rather than a unit basis. 
   IV. HUD Report to the Congress on Ways to Improve the Voucher Program--Requires that the HUD Secretary solicit comments and recommendations for improvement in the voucher program through notice in the Federal Register. Six months after enactment, the Secretary shall submit to the House and Senate Housing Subcommittees and the House and Senate Banking Committees a summary of the recommendations received by the Secretary regarding suggestions for improvement in the voucher program. 
   I. Reauthorize the Self-Help Homeownership Opportunity Program (SHOP)--Reauthorizes the SHOP program which provides funding for land and infrastructure purchases to facilitate self-help housing. Utilized by Habitat for Humanity and the Housing Assistance Council. Reauthorize through FY 2005, beginning with $25 million in FY 2001. Adds new language allowing an additional year to use funds for local groups building five or more homes (increase from two years to three years), and also making it possible for local and national non-profit organizations using SHOP funds to advance their own money to purchase property, pending the environmental review approvals, to be repaid from federal funds after the environmental reviews have been approved. 
   II. Capacity Building for Community Development and Affordable Housing Program--Reauthorizes and increases grants to non-profits to expand affordable housing capacity. Presently authorized for The Enterprise Foundation, Local Initiatives Support Corporation, Habitat for Humanity, Youthbuild USA, and the National Community Development Initiative. Expands access to this program to include the ``National Association of Housing Partnerships'' and authorizes a funding level of $40 million for each of FY 2001-2003. Amounts must be matched three to one from other sources. 
   III. Work Requirement for Public Housing Residents: Coordinate Federal Housing Assistance with State Welfare Reform Work Programs--Requires that able-bodied and non-elderly public housing residents be in compliance with the work requirements of welfare reform in their state. Those unable to comply would be provided the opportunity to engage in community service or participate in an economic self-sufficiency program. There is substantial overlap in families receiving welfare and those benefitting from assisted housing. Among families with children, it is estimated that 72 percent of those who live in public housing receive some type of welfare. These families are currently subject to Welfare Reform work requirements and this provision simply applies the requirement to the remaining able-bodied recipients of federal housing assistance. Public housing was originally conceived as temporary assistance for working low-income families to help them during times of financial distress. Recent housing legislation has recognized this fact by placing increasing emphasis on self-sufficiency. These efforts should be coordinated with the self sufficiency efforts of Welfare Reform. PHAs shall monitor compliance with the state work requirement. There shall be an exception for the elderly and disabled, and as with Welfare Reform, there will be a broad definition of work including; employment, community service, vocational and job training, work associated with self help housing construction, refurbishing publicly assisted housing, the provision of certain child care services, and participation in education programs or economic self-sufficiency programs. This work requirement will replace the 8 hour per month ``Community Service'' Requirement that exists in current law for residents of public housing. Public Housing Authorities shall not be prohibited by this legislation from implementing more stringent work requirements and States electing the housing assistance block grant would be excluded from this requirement and be free to design their own self-sufficiency requirements. 
   IV. Flexible Use of CDBG Funds to Maintain Properties--Amends Section 105(a)(23) of the Housing and Community Development Act, which currently authorizes use of CDBG funding for activities necessary to make essential repairs and payment of operating expenses needed to maintain the habitability of housing units acquired through tax foreclosure proceedings in order to prevent abandonment and deterioration of such housing in primarily low- and moderate-income neighborhoods. This language is amended to permit the use of CDBG funds for property upkeep in instances in which a court has wrested effective control of a distressed residential property from the owner and appointed a responsible third party (often a non-profit organization or other owner/manager of properties in the area) to operate the property on an interim basis as administrator, although legal title remains with the original owner. 
   IV. Allows Vouchers in Grandfamily Housing Assisted with HOME Dollars--Permits flexible use of Section 8 vouchers in Grandfamily Housing assisted with HOME dollars. Current law restricts the level of Section 8 assistance that may be used in projects assisted with HOME funds. This legislation creates an exception to the general rule for projects designed to benefit Grandfamilies, by permitting the use of Section 8 vouchers at the Fair Market Rent (FMR) level by Grandparents choosing to live in low income housing projects assisted with HOME dollars. This change is designed to assist low-income, elderly residents and their grandchildren for whom they provide full-time care and custody. 
   V. Simplified FHA Downpayment Calculation.--Makes permanent the temporary simplified FHA downpayment calculation provided in section 203(b) of the National Housing Act. The current downpayment calculation on FHA loans is needlessly complex. Recent appropriations bills have included a simplified pilot program that replaces the current multi-part formula with a single calculation based solely on the appraised value of the property. The simplified formula yields substantially the same downpayment result as the multi-part formula. 
   VI. Authorize the Use of Section 8 Funds for Downpayment Assistance--Permits tenants to receive up to one year's worth of Section 8 assistance in a lump sum to be used toward the down payment on a home. This compliments innovative programs that allow the use of Section 8 assistance for mortgage payments. 
   VII. Reauthorize the Neighborhood Reinvestment Corporation through 2003--Reauthorizes the Neighborhood Reinvestment Corporation, a congressionally chartered, public non-profit corporation established in 1978 to revitalize declining lower-income communities and provide affordable housing. Funding is authorized at $90 million in FY 2001, and $95 million in each of FY 2002 and 2003. 
   Provides States the option to receive certain federal assisted housing funds (tenant assistance programs) in the form of a block grant. Modeled on Welfare Reform, this would give States the freedom to innovate absent HUD micro-management. States accepted into the program would sign a five year performance agreement with the federal government that details how the State intends to combine and use housing assistance funds from programs included in the performance agreement to advance low income housing priorities, improve the quality of low income housing, reduce homelessness, and encourage economic opportunity and self-sufficiency. States electing the block grant would determine how funds are distributed to state agencies, Public Housing Authorities, project owners, and tenants. During the first year of the performance agreement States would receive the highest of the prior three years funding for each program included in the performance agreement. There would then be an annual inflation adjustment in each future year until Congress (following consultation with HUD) enacts a formula that reflects the relative low-income/affordable housing needs of each State. A performance agreement submitted to the Secretary would have to be approved by the Secretary unless the Secretary makes a written determination, within 60 days after  receiving the performance agreement, that the performance agreement fails to comply with provisions of the Act. Eligible programs for inclusion in the block grant shall include: the voucher program for rental assistance under section 8(o) of the United States Housing Act of 1937; the programs for project-based assistance under section 8 of the United States Housing Act of 1937; the program for housing for the elderly under section 202 of the Housing Act of 1959; the program for housing for persons with disabilities under section 811 of the Cranston-Gonzales National Affordable Housing Act. The distribution of block granted funds within the State from programs included in the performance agreement shall be determined by the Legislature and the Governor of the State. In a State in which the constitution or state law designates another individual, entity, or agency to be responsible for housing, such other individual, entity, or agency shall work in consultation with the Governor and Legislature to determine the local distribution of funds. Existing contracts involving federal housing dollars shall be honored by the States until their expiration. States shall at such point handle the renewal of all contracts. A State may not use more than 3 percent of the total amount of funds allocated to such State under the programs included in the performance agreement for administrative purposes. Performance criteria shall include at a minimum a measure of; the improvement in housing conditions, the number of units that pass housing quality inspections, the number of residents that find employment and move to self-sufficiency, the level of crime against residents, the level of homelessness, the level of poverty, the cost of assisted housing units provided, the level of assistance provided to people with disabilities and to the elderly, success in maintaining the stock of affordable housing, and increasing homeownership. If at the end of the 5-year term of the performance agreement a State has failed to meet at least 80 percent of the performance goals submitted in the performance agreement, the Secretary shall terminate the performance agreement and the State or community shall be required to comply with the program requirement, in effect at the time of termination, of each program included in the performance agreement. To reward States that make significant progress in meeting performance goals, the HUD Secretary shall annually set aside sufficient funds to grant a reward of up to 5 percent of the funds allocated to participating States.

   Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to reduce the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) homeownership tax. I am joined in this effort by Senator GRAMM of Texas, the chairman of the Banking Committee. This legislation was introduced earlier in the month by Congressman RICK LAZIO of New York. Congressman LAZIO chairs the House Subcommittee on Housing and Community Opportunity. 
   This homeownership tax comes in the form of excess premiums paid by those who have FHA insured mortgages on their properties. The FHA Mutual Mortgage Insurance Fund (MMI fund) collects mortgage insurance premiums in order to cover any losses to the government that result from FHA-insured mortgage defaults and to fund the administrative costs of the FHA program. 
   FHA is an important program for first-time, low and moderate income, and minority homeowners. These families should not be overcharged in FHA premiums. Premiums in excess of an amount necessary to maintain an actuarially sound reserve ratio in the FHA Mutual Mortgage Insurance Fund can only be characterized as a tax on homeownership. The Congress has determined that a capital reserve ratio of 2 percent of the MMI fund's amortized insurance-in-force is necessary to ensure the safety and soundness of the MMI fund. According to the Department of Housing and Urban Development the FY 1999 capital reserve ratio is 3.66 percent and is estimated to rise to over 3.8 percent in FY 2000, nearly twice the reserve ratio mandated by Congress. 
   The FHA single family mortgage program was designed to operate as a mutual insurance program where homeowners were granted rebates of excess premiums. This rebate program was suspended at the direction of Congress in 1990 when the MMI fund was in the red--with the intent that the payment of distributive shares or rebates would resume when the Fund was again financially sound. Since 1990 a number of steps have been taken to strengthen the FHA program. The premiums were increased (Congress mandated the addition of a risk-based annual premium to the one-time, up front premium), downpayment requirements were improved, oversight by HUD and the Congress was strengthened, and Congress mandated the minimum 2 percent capital reserve ratio. With a capital reserve ratio nearly twice that mandated by the Congress it is time to resume rebates and return the MMI program to its prior status as a mutual insurance fund. This legislation restores the rebates for mortgages insured for 7 years or more and paid off subsequent to the 1990 rebate suspension. 
   The legislatively mandated improvements in the FHA program have certainly been partially responsible for the strength of the MMI fund. But another major reason for this strength is the fact that we have experienced a near perfect economy in recent years. I recognize that this will not always be the case. We should therefore proceed carefully when we propose to lower or rebate premiums. This legislation takes the cautious approach of providing for rebates only when the reserve ratio is in excess of 3 percent, or 150 percent of the reserve level mandated by Congress. If the capital reserve ratio drops below 3 percent, the rebates will be suspended. The legislation also requires that the General Accounting Office evaluate the adequacy of the 2 percent capital reserve ratio for ensuring the safety and soundness of the MMI fund and make a recommendation to Congress regarding the most appropriate reserve ratio at which to trigger future premium rebates. 
   I invite my colleagues to review this important legislation and join with me in reducing this tax on homeownership. By enacting this homeownership rebate we will continue to help make homeownership affordable for more and more Americans.

   Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I am pleased to take a step in addressing the long-term water needs of the northern Colorado citizens whose water is provided by the City of Loveland, Colorado. The bill I am introducing today authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to enter into contracts with the City of Loveland to utilize federal facilities of the original Colorado-Big Thompson Project for various purposes such as the storage and transportation of non-federal water originating on the eastern slope of the Rocky Mountains and intended for domestic, municipal, industrial and other uses. 
   Water supplies for Colorado cities are extremely limited. Whenever possible, cities attempt to use their water storage and conveyance systems in the most efficient ways they can. The City of Loveland is trying to use excess capacity in the federally built Colorado-Big Thompson conveyance facilities to deliver water to an enlarged city reservoir, but current law does not allow the City to use excess capacity in an existing Federal water delivery canal for domestic purposes. 
   In this case, Loveland intends to convey up to 75 cubic feet per second of its native river water supply from the Big Thompson River to two city-owned facilities, Green Ridge Glade Reservoir and Chasteen Grove Water Treatment Plant. A contract with the Bureau of Reclamation and the Colorado-Big Thompson Project operator, Northern Colorado Water Conservancy District, will provide an economical and reliable means of delivering Loveland's native  river water supplies. The City of Loveland simply desires to ``wheel'' some of its drinking water supply through excess capacity in a canal serving Colorado-Big Thompson Project, a water project built by the Bureau of Reclamation from 1938 to 1957. Loveland is prepared to pay appropriate charges for the use of this facility. In addition, any contract affecting the Colorado-Big Thompson Project would be conducted in full compliance with all applicable environmental requirements. In fact, the Final Environmental Assessment on use of C-BT facilities to convey City of Loveland Water Supplies to an expanded Green Ridge Glade Reservoir has already been completed, and permits have been issued by the Army Corps of Engineers. 
   Allowing Loveland to use the Colorado-Big Thompson Project should be a simple matter, but it is not. Legislation is required to allow the City to use the Federal water project for carriage of municipal and industrial water. Historically when a party has desired to use Reclamation project facilities for the storage or conveyance of non-project water, the authority cited was the Act of February 21, 1911, known as the Warren Act. The Warren Act provides for the utilization of excess capacity in Reclamation project facilities to store non-project, irrigation water. Based on the current interpretation of Reclamation law, the Warren Act does not provide authority to enter into long-term storage or conveyance contracts for non-irrigation, non-project water in Colorado-Big Thompson Project facilities. 
   Congress in recent years has expanded the scope of the Warren Act to apply to communities in California and Utah where there existed a need for more water management flexibility. The legislation I am introducing today is similar to other legislation introduced and passed in the recent Congresses. It will simply extend similar flexibility to the Colorado-Big Thompson Project and to the City of Loveland. Since there is precedent allowing the wheeling of non-federal water through federal facilities, this is a non-controversial piece of legislation. Therefore, I hope that Congress will move quickly to pass this legislation and I look forward to working closely with my colleagues on the Energy and Natural Resources Committee to move it quickly.

   Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I also rise in opposition to this amendment and join my colleague from Arizona in his opposition. We just held a number of hearings in the Housing and Transportation Subcommittee of the Banking Committee. I chair this subcommittee. We found that we even have the Federal Transit Administration subsidizing Amtrak. Clearly, in my mind, when I look at the 1997 accountability act, Congress intended to move Amtrak to self-sufficiency. 
   Amtrak claims to be a private corporation, and, plainly and simply, private corporations are not eligible to lease Government vehicles. 
   I have grown increasingly skeptical about what is going on with Amtrak. It  seems they found a way of picking up Government subsidies all over the place. 
   Several years ago, the FTA required--I want to get back to some other issues that may either be directly or indirectly related to this amendment, but several years ago, The Federal Transit Authority required the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority to bid out contracts for their commuter rail services. Four companies bid. Amtrak had the highest cost bid and lowest quality. 
   This will cost taxpayers $75 million above the low bid. This is a $75 million, 3-year subsidy on top of the nearly $600 million annual subsidy Congress grants Amtrak. Now they want the subsidy of leasing Government vehicles. I ask my colleagues: When are we really going to require Amtrak to be self-sufficient? 
   For that reason, I oppose this amendment with my colleague from Arizona and urge a ``no'' vote.

   Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, today I rise in strong support of the FY 2001 Defense Appropriations Act Conference Report. This bill provides the much needed funding for our deserving men and women in the military. After years of declining military budgets, this Defense Appropriations bill does the right thing by putting more of our resources toward our Armed Forces. 
   While I strongly support the overall bill, I would like to make note of one serious omission--the cut in funding for the Discoverer II or DII program. I know that Senator STEVENS and the Defense Appropriations staff fought hard for the DII program, but that they ran up against an entrenched opposition from the other side. 
   Discoverer II is a key element in assessing the utility, feasibility, and affordability of Space Based Radar (SBR). SBR will provide all weather, 24 hour, 7-day a week global surveillance coverage. The Department of Defense has stated that SBR will satisfy many unfilled requirements, such as Long Range Endurance Reconnaissance, Surveillance and Target Acquisition, Improved Ground Moving Target Indicator Tasking, Processing, Exploitation and Dissemination Interoperability, and provide simultaneous access to multiple theaters worldwide. 
   The program not only had the wide support of many Members of Congress, but also from the Secretary of the Air Force, the Director of the National Reconnaissance Office, the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics, the CINC of US Space Command, the CINC of US Central Command, and the Chief of Staff of the Air Force. 
   While I cannot understand the reasoning for such opposition, I do want to thank Senator STEVENS and his staff for fighting for this program and only hope that we can revive this important program in the future. The capabilities it will provide are too important to let it go quietly in the night. As the Chairman of the Strategic Subcommittee on the Armed Service Committee, as a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, and as a member of the Commission on the National Reconnaissance Office, I have heard from our military and intelligence leaders that this capability is needed and that we must demonstrate the space based radar. That is why I will continue to fight for this defense capability. 
   Again, Mr. President, I want to thank Senator STEVENS for all his hard work and for producing such a strong bill for our military men and women.

   Mr. ALLARD. The Red Mountain project, located in the communities of Silverton and Ouray Colorado, is a top priority for the U.S. Forest Service this year. 
   Red Mountain is a 10,500 acre site that is one of the most nationally renowned scenic and historic resources in Southwestern Colorado. Before the Silver Crash in 1893, Red Mountain was a vibrant mining town, home to thousands of miners and their families, living in four communities and working dozens of rich silver mines. Today, the remnants of this community have been designated by Ouray and San Juan Counties as a historical landmark, and just named one of the National Trust for Historic Preservation's 11 most endangered sites in America. In addition, Red Mountain contains extensive habitat for endangered species as well as other sensitive species. The area offers an abundance of recreation opportunities to one million visitors annually--from hiking, biking and four-wheel driving to cross country skiing and mountaineering. 
   As you may know, this year although the Forest Service recommended $10 million in its FY01 budget for a Colorado project called Silver Mountain, we have received correspondence from the Forest Service indicating that this project is no longer viable. In addition, the U.S. Forest Service has further indicated that the Red Mountain project is a top priority for funding this year. Therefore, I urge you to consider allocating the $10 million from the Silver Mountain project to the Red Mountain project as the Interior bill moved toward conference.

   Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I have come to the floor to support eliminating the marriage penalty. I think it is timely that we have some votes scheduled this evening, I understand about 6:15 p.m. By eliminating the marriage penalty, we eliminate one of the most egregious examples of unfairness and complexity in the Tax Code to date. Another example of that would be the death tax or the inheritance tax. We dealt with that issue last week. I am extremely excited that it has passed the House, passed the Senate, and is now going on to the President for his signature. 
   Both these taxes are prominent concerns of my constituents, at a time when the tax burden is at record high levels in this country. When we are talking about eliminating the death tax, we are talking about the family business and what happens to a family business after an unexpected death without any estate planning, and how much the Government takes of that estate, forcing the sale. Many times it is a farm or a ranch that has been in the family for many, many generations. 
   When we talk about the marriage penalty--we are eliminating that unfair burden--we are talking about the family. We are talking about reducing the tax burden. We are talking about fairness and Tax Code simplification. 
   Just a brief description needs to be made of the marriage penalty. The marriage penalty exists when a married couple, filing a joint tax return, pays higher taxes than if the same couple were not married and were filing as individuals. The penalty varies, depending on the tax bracket in which the couple may find themselves. The example that has been used before is based on an assumption that both spouses are each holding down separate jobs, each earning about $30,000, in 1999. It is determined they would pay about $7,655 in Federal income taxes. If these two individuals were not married and both earned the same amount of money, and had each filed a single tax return, they would pay only $6,892 in combined tax liability. There is a $763 difference in tax liability. This is what we refer to when we talk about the marriage tax penalty. 
   According to the Congressional Budget Office, almost half of all married couples--it figures out to about 22 million--suffered from the marriage tax penalty last year. The average penalty paid by these couples was around $1,500. In the previous example, the marriage penalty was the result of a higher combined standard deduction for two workers filing as singles than for married couples, and the income tax bracket thresholds for married couples are less than twice the threshold for single taxpayers. We are trying to eliminate this problem. 
   The best illustration of the real tax burden faced by families is to compare today's tax burden of an average family with the tax burden of a family with average income of four decades ago. The total tax burden for the family today is 39 percent of its income. That is up from 18 percent in 1955. The Federal payroll taxes and State and local taxes have literally doubled the total tax burden faced by families. As a result, the middle-income family today has 25 percent less disposable income than a similar family in 1955.  
   The bill we have been working on in the Senate, and which many of us support, addresses the standard deduction problem I alluded to, and it increases the standard deduction for married couples filing jointly to twice the standard deduction for single taxpayers. According to the Subcommittee on Taxation, this provision provides tax relief to approximately 25 million couples filing joint returns. Hopefully, it can be made effective after December 31, 2000. That is what we are talking about in this particular marriage penalty relief bill. 
   It also raises the tax brackets. The bill expands, over a 6-year period--this is not happening all at once, it is gradually 
   happening over a 6-year period--the 15-percent and 28-percent income tax brackets for a married couple filing a joint return to twice the size of the corresponding brackets for an individual filing a single return. This is a phase-in provision, ultimately providing relief to 21 million married couples, including 3 million senior citizens. 
   We also try to address the earned-income credit. This bill increases the beginning and the end of the phase out of the earned-income credit for couples filing a joint return. Currently, for a couple with two or more children, the earned-income credit begins phasing out at $12,690 and is eliminated for couples earning more than $31,152. Under this bill, the new range would be $2,500 higher. The maximum increase in the earned-income tax credit in this provision for an eligible couple is $526. As you recall, the earned-income tax credit was put in place to try to help low-income individuals so they would be encouraged to go out and get a job and to stay off welfare. Also, there is a provision preserving the family tax credits. 
   The bill permanently extends the current temporary exemption from the individual alternative minimum tax for family-related tax credits. This is so that, once you grant tax deductions and credits, the alternative minimum tax doesn't come in and take that all away. 
   One of the complaints I hear from my constituents is it seems as if Congress has been working on tax cuts, they pass tax cuts, they get signed by the President, but we don't seem to feel it when we are paying our taxes on April 15. One of the reasons that you do not feel it is because, in some cases, the alternative minimum tax kicks in, it takes effect, and that means the previous tax cuts that were applied to a particular taxpayer did not take effect because of the alternative minimum tax. 
   Members of the Democratic Party have thwarted passage of any kind of relief for marriage, as far as the Tax Code is concerned, since 1995. In 1995, we had the marriage tax penalty bill passed by the Congress, sent to the President, a Democratic President. He vetoed it. In 1999, we sent a bill to the Democratic President and he vetoed it. Earlier this year, in April, there was a Democratic filibuster that prevented a marriage penalty bill from moving forward. We need to pass and the President needs to sign a marriage tax penalty provision to give relief to married couples. 
   This year I have held town meetings in all 63 of Colorado's counties. At those meetings I heard from many of my constituents about how strongly they feel about tax relief. In Colorado, over 400,000 couples incur an additional tax burden simply because they are married. 
   I have some numbers here, numbers from the Congressional Budget Office. I find them very disturbing. Almost half of all married couples, the 22 million couples I mentioned earlier, suffered from the marriage penalty provisions last year. 
   Again, as in the rest of the country, many of these couples on average have suffered a $1,500 penalty where, if they had not been married, they would not have had to pay this amount. 
   Cumulatively, the marriage tax penalty increases the taxes on affected couples throughout the United States by about $32 billion per year. That is money that families could use toward their own needs, rather than Washington trying to set the priorities for American families. 
   This penalty is not a tax on the rich. The marriage tax penalty exists because of multiple tax brackets and the fact that the standard deductions for married couples are not twice those given to single people. This tax can be incurred by folks in every tax bracket. In fact, families with two wage earners are the hardest hit by the marriage penalty. There are more and more of these families in today's workforce. Many of these folks are in the lower to middle class--people working hard to provide for their children. Taxing these folks for being married is plain wrong. 
   Another one of the groups implicitly taxed under the marriage penalty is the working poor. The earned-income tax credit is an effective tool in helping these low-income workers, but the EITC is phased out more quickly for married couples than for individuals. So the families incur a greater tax burden simply for being married. 
   Some colleagues of mine call for more Government spending for education, health care, and housing. I believe if we simply allow the American family to keep more of their money, we permit them to better afford the things they need. 
   In this time of a historic budget surplus, we still have nearly record high taxation. Hard-working American families deserve to keep some of this money. It is theirs in the first place, and I see it as the responsibility of Congress to return some of this money to the people. 
   To permit the marriage tax penalty to continue is wrong. Allowing American families to keep this money is the right thing to do, and I believe it is time to do away with the marriage tax penalty. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, the Feingold amendment would undermine the U.S. sea-based deterrent force by killing the Trident D-5 missile program. Such a decision would cut the Navy's requirement short by 53 missiles resulting in the deployment of three fewer submarines that DOD currently believes are required. 
   I move to table the amendment. 
   I ask for the yeas and nays.

   Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the Feingold amendment. I happen to believe we need a strong national defense. I think an important ingredient in having a strong national defense is that we have a defense system that is technologically advanced over any opposition we may face in the world; that we have a versatile defense system; and that we have some mobility so we can avoid duplication. 
   A key ingredient of a strong national defense is our submarine program, which includes the submarine-launched ballistic missile. An important part of a submarine-launched ballistic missile is the D-5. 
   The Feingold amendment would cut $462.7 million in funds to procure the Trident D-5 missiles and, in effect, would terminate the D-5 production program. For that reason, I strongly oppose this amendment. 
   The Department of Defense also happens to oppose this amendment. That was not an easy decision. There was a lot of consideration on what should be the proper level of defense and how submarine defenses should be a part of that. The Navy, after a considerable amount of thought, decided they needed to outfit a total of 14 Trident submarines with the D-5 missile. This will require a total inventory of 425 Trident missiles. With the fiscal year 2000 budget, the Navy will have 53 missiles left to procure to meet this inventory objective. We have gone through most of the program. We are not going to have much left, as far as funding missiles, after this fiscal year. 
   In 1994, there was a nuclear posture review. This review was done by the Department of Defense and it has been persistently evaluated. The conclusion is that the U.S. needs 
   14 Trident submarines at a minimum to be able to maintain a two-ocean SLBM force that is stabilizing, operationally effective, and which enhances deterrence. 
   The Department of Defense is planning on maintaining 14 Trident submarines for the foreseeable future regardless of arms control developments. Current plans are to maintain 14 boats under START II as well as under START III. Terminating the D-5 program, after fiscal year 2000, would mean the Navy would only have enough missiles to outfit 11 boats. Over time, as operational flight testing uses up an already inadequate missile inventory, you begin to reduce the number of submarines you would be able to maintain on operational status even further. We would decidedly have a lack of missiles to meet the goal for a two-ocean SLBM force. 
   The Feingold amendment cuts the entire fiscal year 2001 budget request for D-5 production. However, even if the Congress wanted to terminate the D-5 program following the fiscal year 2001 procurement, the Navy would still need to spend over $330 million in procurement funds to terminate the production program. Hence, the Feingold amendment would not only prematurely stop production, but it would also preclude orderly termination of the program. 
   Way back in January of this year, in a report to Congress, the Secretary of Defense stated that the impact of procuring less than 425 of the D-5 missiles would be very severe. Specifically, the Secretary of Defense indicated that such a decision would have adverse impacts on the effectiveness of the U.S. strategic deterrent, severely weaken reliability, accuracy, and safety assessments associated with the D-5 operational flight test program, and would undermine the strategic missile industrial and production base of the United States at a time when the D-5 missile is the only strategic missile still in production. 
   The Secretary's report also indicated that termination of the D-5 missile before the planned completion of 425 missiles would result in a unilateral reduction of deployed U.S. strategic warheads in both the START I and the START II regimes and is not consistent with U.S. START III plans. 
   The Navy also looked at retaining older C-4 missiles to fill in the lack of the D-5 missiles. It concluded that this would be even more costly and inefficient than simply completing the D-5 production run. 
   With only 53 missiles to procure, termination at this point will produce only marginal savings and will have a severe operational impact on our ability to maintain a stable deterrent force. 
   It is based on these factors that I strongly urge my colleagues to oppose the amendment by the Senator from Wisconsin. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I will respond, if I may. 
   The amendment cuts funds which would require termination of the program, plain and simple. DOD has repeatedly reviewed that very question.  Each time they have concluded we need 53 additional missiles. 
   Keep in mind, the goal originally was set up that we needed to maintain a submarine force in the Pacific Ocean as well as the Atlantic Ocean. It was determined that, at a minimum, we had to have 14 submarines, and we needed to have them adequately armed in order to provide the defenses we need. 
   The Trident submarine is the core of the U.S. strategic deterrent force, and the Trident force is the most survivable leg of our strategic triad. 
   I think it is important we go ahead and complete this program, recognizing that we are towards the end of manufacturing of the missiles. 
   I think it only makes sense that we complete it and maintain a strong defense. I believe a strong defense does serve as a deterrent, and it helps assure world peace. For that reason, I strongly oppose the amendment of the Senator from Wisconsin. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I believe I need to respond again. We have had a report as late as January of this year, and it is that we should maintain 14 Trident submarines not only through START I and II, but also START III. So I think this is forward looking. I think it helps us assure our goals of a strong defense. It maintains a versatile force and keeps us technologically advanced, with the mobility we need. I think it is an essential aspect of our defense, and I think it would be foolhardy for us to cut the funds necessary to fully develop the 425 D-5 missiles for the Trident submarine. 
   I yield back the remainder of my time.

    Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I rise to comment on some significant developments that have recently taken place in my home state of Colorado that will positively benefit the entire world of telecommunications. 
   Qwest Communications International, Inc. of Denver, a young, worldwide leader in broadband Internet-based communications, continues to expand its technologies and vision for the coming century. Just three and one-half years ago, this innovative company catapulted the world into the Information Age beginning by branding its nation-wide fiber-optic network and developing connections into Mexico, intercontinental cable to Europe and transpacific submarine capacity to the Pacific Rim. The Company's services provide a full range of leading-edge data, voice, video, e-commerce, web-hosting and related services to consumers and business customers, including a variety of multimillion dollar government contracts recently awarded to Qwest, such as the Treasury Department and DOE's Energy Sciences Network. 
   Qwest has positioned itself for the new Information Age economy by combining its strengths and forming numerous strategic alliances, partnerships and evolving its next-generation infrastructure through a variety of acquisitions. 
   About one year ago Qwest and U.S. WEST announced their intent to merge. On Friday, June 30 that merger became reality. 
   I applaud the FCC, the states and other appropriate agencies for reviewing and approving this complementary merger in a respectable timeframe and in accordance with the 1996 Telecommunications Act. This now allows the ``new'' Qwest to bring a different competitive dynamic to the global marketplace. 
   I ask my colleagues today to join me in commending the regulatory bodies for enhancing the process of this merger and to the Companies' merger review team, led by Drake Tempest and Steve Davis, as well as other Company officials. In closing, I extend my best wishes for continued success to Qwest and its Chairman and CEO, Joe Nacchio. Mr. Nacchio will resume the leadership of the ``new'' Qwest to bring the benefits of this global Company to all of our constituents.

    Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, Trinidad State Junior College, the oldest two-year college in Colorado, is celebrating 75 years of excellence. Established in 1925 by the Colorado Legislature, the College can look back with pride over its 75 years of service to its community, the State of Colorado, and the Nation. 
   Throughout its history, Trinidad State Junior College has attracted students from across Colorado, from many areas of the United States, and from numerous foreign countries. The result has been the creation of an environment that is significantly more cosmopolitan than is found in other rural two-year colleges. 
   Trinidad State Junior College will carry forth its strong tradition of scholastic excellence into the new century and will continue to provide its students with the knowledge, skills, and experiences necessary to meet their educational and personal goals. 
   Congratulations to Trinidad State Junior College on its seventy-fifth anniversary.

   Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I would like to make a statement concerning the Federally funded research that is conducted at the various Centers for Disease Control (CDC) around the country. 
   February of this year I met with the Director of the CDC, Jeffrey Koplan. CDC was highlighted in newspaper articles concerning the misuse of research funds targeted for hantavirus disease. Because of the presence of this disease in our state, as with other neighboring states, I am very concerned at the lack of accountability from the CDC. 
   I expressed my concern for the correct utilization of funding for the disease research programs that are mandated by Congress. I stressed the importance of CDC's accountability and obligation to carry out the letter of our laws. Mr. Koplan assured me that they have taken measures to complete a full audit of the misdirected funds  and that they will follow the intent of Congress in the future. 
   Being a member of Congress, I for one can fully understand that the process of appropriating funds for research is complicated at best. Although Congress designates specific funds for certain diseases, there are several levels of bureaucracy through which the dollars must pass before they are received by the appropriate agency. This still does not account for an agency's lack of dedication in meeting congressional direction that is law. Part of my responsibility as a U.S. Senator is the oversight of various agencies and their accountability to Congress to carry out the language of our laws. 
   Hantavirus outbreaks have rapidly affected the U.S., reaching as far as Vermont. Most recently, a 12-year-old girl who lives in Loveland--my hometown--was diagnosed with the disease. Doctor's believe she may have contracted the disease while visiting a ranch in Arizona last April. Once hantavirus is contracted it can be anywhere from one week to as little as one day before symptoms appear. Once symptoms are prevalent, it rapidly progresses to respiratory distress as the lungs fill with fluid. 
   Colorado has had 23 cases of hantavirus since 1998--with three cases already this year. It is time to act with no further delay by the CDC laboratory. 
   I hope that the CDC has worked out it's problems and will carry out what Congress expects of an agency.

   Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, today I am introducing a bill to improve the healthcare options for veterans in southern Colorado. To do this, I am expediting the transfer of the Ft. Lyon facility to the State of Colorado, which will allow the Veterans Administration (VA) to implement their plan to use the annual $8.6 million in savings from the closure of Fort Lyon to provide better service to Colorado's veterans through new outpatient clinics in La Junta, Lamar and Alamosa and a smaller, more efficient nursing home in Pueblo, CO. 
   Ft. Lyon is a historical building, but it is simply not more important than the needs of those who served us. I would prefer that the money currently used to maintain the facility was instead used to provide medical care for those veterans who need it. 
   This bill will lead to an improvement in medical services for veterans in several ways. With the estimated $8.6 million in savings to be realized after the Ft. Lyon closure, clinics will be set up in local communities which will be closer and more responsive to their local veteran communities. This bill mandates that the VA must open the replacement clinics before they convey Ft. Lyon to the State of Colorado, to ensure there is no gap in service. This bill will help to ensure that no service-connected veteran's needs are unmet. No veteran will go homeless. Every veteran who needs a nursing home bed due to service connected illness will still be granted one. Those veterans currently in Ft. Lyon will continue to receive nursing home care, at no additional charges to them. The cemetery and historic Kit Carson chapel will remain fully accessible to the public. And the people of the region will also be assisted by the opening of a state facility to replace Ft. Lyon in the local economy. Without this legislation, there are no guarantees any of this would occur. 
   I hope that this bill will be considered and pass quickly, so that the savings and the improvements in veteran's healthcare can begin as soon as possible.

    Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, on May 4, 2000 those attending the National Day of Prayer luncheon in Denver, Colorado got to hear an electrifying talk by Dr. Condoleezza Rice. I found the speech so moving, so inspiring that I wanted to share it with those who could not be in attendance that day to her remarks. ``Condi,'' as she likes to be called, grew up in Denver, graduated Magna Cum Laude from Denver University and has served our country in many ways including service to former President George Bush as a chief expert on Russia. I ask that her speech be printed in the RECORD. 
   National Day of Prayer, Denver, Colorado, May 4, 2000  
   Thank you very much. It is indeed a delight to be with you here in Denver for the Colorado Prayer Lunch. I do know quite a few people in the room, and there are good friends here from very far back in my history. I'm not going to tell you who they are because I don't want you to go up to them and ask them how I really was at fifteen or sixteen years old. But it's awfully nice to back here--home in Denver. 
   I bring you greetings from my family. My parents and I moved to Denver when I was twelve years old, and this is just a great place to live. I think the reason that it is such a great place to live is events like this. You look around and you see the love in the community, you see the strength in the community. It's nice to be back. 
   When I thought about what I'd like to talk with you about, I immediately reflected on the fact that this is of course our National Day of Prayer as well as the day for the Colorado Prayer Luncheon. And I thought about spending a few minutes with you talking about the relationship of personal faith, to faith in a community, to strength and forward movement in a community. Because very often we think about where we would like the community to go, we think about where we would like our leaders to take us. We very often forget that strong communities are built person by person, step by step, by the responsibility of each and every one of us. That responsibility and that strength, I believe, can come from many different sources, and certainly it comes from different sources for different people. But for many of us, and perhaps for most of the people in this room, it certainly relates to deep and abiding faith in God, whatever one's religious background. For me it comes from a deep and abiding faith in Jesus Christ. 
   Now I have to tell you that I was born into the church. I didn't have much choice. In fact, on the day that I was born which was a Sunday, at 11:48 my father was preaching a sermon. He had been told on Friday night that his child probably wasn't going to be born for a couple of days, so go ahead on Sunday and preach the sermon. And my goodness when he came out of the pulpit on Sunday, he had a little girl. 
   We lived in the back of the church until I was three and then moved into a parsonage. My grandparents were religious people. I studied piano from the age of three. I could read music before I could read. But the first song that I learned was ``What a Friend We Have in Jesus.'' And then I learned to play ``Amazing Grace,'' etc. etc. 
   My grandfather was a deeply religious person. Indeed I have a lot of heroes in my life, but Granddaddy Rice is perhaps the most remarkable because you see back in about 1920  he was a sharecropper's son in Ewtah, Alabama. One day he decided he wanted to get book learning, heaven knows why. And so he asked people how could a colored man go to college, and they said, ``Well, you see if you could get to Stillman College (which is this little Presbyterian college down the road) then you could go to college there.'' So he saved up his cotton, went to Stillman College, paid for his first year and then the second year they said, ``Now how do you plan to pay for your second year?'' And he said, ``Well, I've used all the money I have.'' And they said, ``Well, you'll have to go home,'' And he said, ``Well, how to those boys go to college?'' They said, ``Well, you see they have what's called a scholarship, and if you wanted to be a Presbyterian minister, then you could have a scholarship too.'' My grandfather said, ``You know, that's exactly what I had in mind,'' and he became college educated, and my family has been Presbyterian ever since. 
   So I was born into the church. My earliest memories are of Sunday school and choir practice and youth fellowship, and indeed if you're a minister's child, you have some kind of strange memories because you see when I heard that story about Christ coming again, I figured when I was about six years old that if he was going to come again anyway, He might as well come to Westminster Presbyterian Church because that would certainly help the flagging attendance in the summer. And so I would pray, ``If you're going to come, Christ, come to my father's church. He could use the help,'' You see you had different ways of thinking about religion when you were a preacher's child. 
   But because I was born into the church, I never really doubted the existence of God. I can tell you that I accepted from the earliest years the whole mystery of the faith, the birth, the life, the death, and the resurrection as truth. Mine then is not a story of conversion to faith. The existence of God was a given for me. That Jesus Christ was His son was a given for me. But while mine is not a story of conversion, it is a story of a journey to deepen my personal faith, and I would imagine that for many of you, a story that resonates, a story that has a familiar ring. You see, it's easy when you are born to religious faith to take that faith for granted, and not to deepen and to grow in it, not to question, and to become comfortable with it. 
   When we moved here to Denver, I was at Montview Boulevard Presbyterian Church. I was in the choir. I met some members of Montview Boulevard here today with whom I sang in the choir. It was a wonderful church, a large church. And then I moved to California, and for awhile I continued to go to church as I had done every Sunday since I could remember. But you know pretty soon things got busy. And so before you knew it, Sundays were for something else. Maybe I had to work. Maybe I had to do something about that lecture that I had to give on Monday. I was always traveling because I'm a specialist in international politics, so maybe I was in some other time zone, and when I got home I was just too tired to go to church. And slowly but surely my faith which I'd always taken for granted was there, but it was rather in the deeper recesses of my mind, not front and center in the way that I lived my life daily. 
   A funny thing happened in that period to me. One Sunday morning when I knew I should have been in church, I was in the Lucky Supermarket instead. And I was walking among the spices buying food, and I'll never forget running into a black man there. And if you know Palo Alto, that's a rare occurrence anyway. And he told me he was buying some food for his church picnic, and we talked a little, and then he looked right at me and he said, ``Do you play the piano?'' And I said ``Yes, I play the piano,'' And he said, ``You know my church, Jerusalem Baptist Church down the road here just a little bit, needs somebody to play the piano. Would you come and play the piano for us?'' And so I did for several months go and play the piano for Jerusalem Baptist Church. And I thought, ``If that's not the long reach of the Lord into the Lucky Supermarket on a Sunday morning, what is?'' But as a result of going there and playing and getting involved again with the church community, I began to see how much my faith, which I'd taken for granted, was becoming unpracticed, that it was no longer really becoming a part of the way that I lived my daily life. 
   And so I started seeking out a church home, and I found Menlo Park Presbyterian in Menlo Park right next to Palo Alto. And one of the first sermons that I heard at Menlo Park Presbyterian Church just reached out and grabbed me because it said where I was in my own faith. And it was the story of the prodigal son. But it was the story of the prodigal son told from the perspective of the older son, not from the son who had to come home, but the son who had always been there. And the minister talked about how the older son was really appalled, angry, and couldn't quite understand why while be had been there toiling in the fields and had been a good son and had supported his family, why there was all this excitement when the prodigal son came home. 
   And I thought about it, and maybe what Christ was saying here, what God was saying, was that the prodigal son who had to be born again to this faith was being brought powerfully back to his faith. While the older son who had always been there doing what he was supposed to do but maybe just doing it in the most routine fashion was losing what's most important about faith, and that's the deepening and the fire that comes from having it tested, from having to worry about it, from having to think about it, from having to bat it around in your mind from time to time so that it doesn't become stale. And I suddenly saw myself as the elder son. And I thought at that time, it's time to renew my faith and not to take it for granted. And you know, it's a good thing that I did because I was soon to learn why faith is so important in your daily life. 
   It was about a year and a half after coming back to my faith that I lost my mother, and I can tell you that I could not have gotten through that without a strong and robust faith. You see the preparation for struggle that faith accords you is not something that you can call on the day that it happens. You have to have honed it, you have to have worked at it, it has to have become a part of you. I began to understand during that period of time when I really was experiencing the peace that passeth all understanding, that faith is honed in struggle, that Paul was absolutely right when he wrote in Romans that we are justified in faith and that struggle brings patience, and patience hope, and hope is not disappointed. Because it is in that time of struggle that we learn that we are resilient human beings, that we have at our core the ability to rebound and to go on. 
   Over the years, I have become more and more interested in the stories of struggle--whether it is the death of a loved one, whether it is what Colorado went through in Columbine, whether it is the struggle that interestingly built Stanford University. Do you know that Stanford University was built by Governor and Mrs. Stanford to honor their only child who died of typhoid at sixteen years old? And Mrs. Stanford writes in her letters that she wanted to die too when her son and then her husband died shortly thereafter, but she understood that her faith was telling her to go on, to pick up the pieces, to do something for other people's children. And so Stanford University was from the Stanfords a living monument to other people's children, born of the test of faith, the test that is struggle. And I began to understand too the words of an old Negro spiritual that had always been somewhat confusing--``Nobody knows the trouble I've seen. Glory Hallelujah''? What does that mean? It means that out of struggle, faith is honed. 
   Now why is faith honed out of struggle? First of all, because you are at that time forced to confront the relationship between faith and doubt. When my mother died, I didn't have any good answers. Did I on the one hand pray to God for understanding and on the other hand doubt why this had happened? Of course when Columbine happened, did you on the one hand pray for understanding and doubt why had it happened? But faith, and indeed the lessons of Christ teach us that faith can be strengthened by doubt. It doesn't have to be weakened by it. 
   Some of my favorite stories in the Bible actually come from the time when Christ is preparing to die. And when the disciples--men who had walked with Him for the entire time of His ministry, men who knew Him better than anyone else--found themselves doubting and fearful of what was to come. He said, ``I'll go to prepare a place for you.'' They said, ``Take us with you because we don't actually know where you're going.'' This isn't very reassuring. And of course the story of Thomas which we had always been taught in a kind of pejorative sense ``the doubting Thomas,'' but in fact what did Christ say? ``Here, feel my side. Touch the wounds.'' He didn't say just ``Leave.'' Doubt and faith have gone together from the beginning of our religious experiences. And in times of struggle, we are forced to work through our doubts in order to re-energize our faith. 
   Times of struggle also challenge us on the relationship between faith and reason because most of us live most of our lives in our heads. We try and understand why. And if you are like me and you live in an intellectual community, if you can't prove it, if you can't see it, then you can't possibly believe it. And yet there are those times when reason just will not do the job. I noticed the little quote by Abraham Lincoln in the bulletin this morning. ``I've been driven many times to my knees by the overwhelming conviction that I had nowhere else to go. My own wisdom and that of all about me seemed insufficient for the day.'' How many times has your reason, your intellect failed you and you've had to fall back on faith? In times of struggle, we learn to trust, we learn to fall back on faith, we learn to fall back on that which cannot be seen and cannot be understood, and it makes us stronger. 
   Finally, in times of struggle, perhaps more than at other times, we are reminded also of the responsibilities of faith, particularly if we've been through struggles ourselves and we are called on to participate in, to be a part of someone else's struggle. And it is that relationship between personal faith and taking one's faith into the community to make it better that I want to explore for a moment now--to take the lessons and the power of faith outside of our own personal experiences and into the community at large. 
   Now in order to do that, you have to draw on other parts of your faith. You have to draw on what has been honed and toughened inside you when you yourself have struggled. But you also have to draw on the power that is there for you to first and foremost be optimistic. When I am very often asked what has  faith done for me that is most important, I say that yes it's been there for me in tough times and struggle, but I think it's also made me an optimistic person. It's made me a person who believes that there can be a better tomorrow. 
   If you don't believe that faith plays its role in making you an optimistic person, think of the people who built this country and the optimism that must have come from their faith. Have you ever wondered what it must have been like to come across the Continental Divide without roads? They must have had faith that they were going to make it. They must have had optimism about what was possible on the other side. They must have gone together and indeed from that they built a great country. Have you ever wondered about the faith and optimism of my ancestors, slaves who were three-fifths of a man who endured the most awful hardships of day-to-day life and yet somehow looked optimistically to a future? They must have done it out of the strength of their faith. They must have done it out of the optimism that only faith can give. 
   But imparting that optimism to people who are in need, imparting the mysteries and the lessons of faith to people who are in struggle is sometimes, oddly enough, easier than imparting and using the lessons of faith in everyday life. Sometimes we mobilize to use our faith when things are tough. This city mobilized around Columbine. People are able to bring themselves to love one another--Greeks and Turks after the earthquake in Turkey, because you're mobilized in your faith to help. But what about day to day in your interactions with people in the community? Can you mobilize your faith in the same way? 
   I think sometimes the biggest impediment to mobilizing our faith in our day to day interactions in trying to make our communities better is really in our lack of humility about what we as mere human beings can bring to the table. You know sometimes people of faith are wonderful at dealing with people in need. But in more normal times we're our own worst enemy because sometimes the shouting, the desire to lecture, overwhelms the desire to lecture, overwhelms the desire to listen and to understand. I think sometimes that the greatest impediment to people of faith in really making a difference in their communities to people on a daily basis--not just when we need to be mobilized--is that we sometimes have trouble, as people of faith, meeting people where they are, not where we would like them to be. 
   And hereto, I draw on a lesson from Christ. Have you ever noticed that when Christ was interacting with people, He found a way to meet them where they were? With the rich young leader, it was confrontational--to give up everything and to give it to the poor was pretty confrontational. With Lazarus and the sisters, it was dramatic--a miracle. With the woman at the well, it was kind and understanding and quiet. How many of us as people of faith have that entire repertoire at our disposal? When we deal with people, do we ever stop shouting so loud that they can hear through us the still, small voice of calm, remembering afterall that we will not personally work miracles in people's lives? That is the work of God. But if we are to be a conduit, we have to be a conduit that is willing to listen, a conduit that is willing to help with humility, and a conduit that is willing to meet people where they are. 
   Those I think are the lessons of faith--to hone our personal faith, to practice it every day, to pray for our leaders and for those who must carry the heavy burdens, and to try to use our faith and its lessons, not just when we need to be mobilized, but in our everyday interactions. Because only then can people of faith really make a difference in communities at home and communities abroad. 
   Thank you very much, and God bless you.

We have two debts that are referred to frequently in debate, and I want to talk about each one of them individually. One is the burden of the national debt on America, and, as of June 14, 2000, the total national debt to the penny was $5,651,368,584,663.04. 
   If we look at the debt that was owed to the public, there is an equally astounding figure of $3,499,251,116,128.15. 
   How does this break down to each citizen's share of the national debt? If you were born today, what kind of debt would you have to face as you grew and paid for your education and started your own business and raised your family? Each citizen born today in America would owe $20,550 on the national debt; or another way of putting it, $12,724 on the debt owed to the public. 
   In 1961, Congress established within the Department of the Treasury the Bureau of the Public Debt, an account for citizens to repay the public debt. Our amendment is an attempt to accomplish just that. What it does, it makes a one-time payment out of the fiscal year 2000 surplus--that is the budget we are operating under right now--to the account. We have a total of about 26.5 billion surplus dollars that have come in this year. We have already obligated about $14.3 billion in an effort for emergency spending. 
   This includes some adjustments between spending provisions we did last year where we forwarded some of our spending. We 
   are going to move it back so it is within each fiscal year. It included some emergency spending for Kosovo and some emergency spending for farm programs and a number of other items. That leaves $12.2 billion on the table. So this amendment says we want to take those $12.2 billion and move them into the debt repayment account that Americans can pay into now, that we established in 1961. 
   This holds the Senate accountable for limited emergency supplemental spending consistent with the budget, I might add. I think each of us individually in the Senate, and Members of the House, ought to make a personal commitment to try to enforce provisions of that budget. That was voted on by this body, voted out of the body. If it is going to mean anything, I think Members of the Senate have to make a concerted effort to help enforce the provisions of the budget. 
   The amendment I have introduced, with the help of some of my colleagues, was scored by CBO as a no-cost intergovernmental transfer. It is well within the budget rules, the rules of the Senate, and it is an important amendment. It is something we need to address. We simply have to get the debt under control. I have introduced legislation in the past that has put forth a plan whereby we try to pay down the debt over 30 years, then, later on, introduced more legislation so we go ahead and pay down the debt over 20 years. 
   The fact is, we are having unprecedented surpluses coming in to the Government coffers. A lot of it is because of the amount of work and labor that is happening out there. It is due to American initiative that has been propelled by the free enterprise society in which we live. It is unprecedented in the history of this country. 
   If we do not do something to pay down the debt now, we are going to miss a great opportunity to have a secure, a more prosperous future for the young Americans of today, our future leaders. 
   I hope we can adopt this amendment as a minor first step in paying down our total debt. We simply should not, as a matter of conscience, continue to increase spending year after year with a total disregard of the total debt that we have accumulated. We simply need to be doing something to pay down our national debt. 
   This is a small step. It is something that hopefully will begin to get this Senate to understand and this Congress to realize we ought to have a plan of 20 years to pay down the debt. It is accountability on further emergency spending. Emergency spending is not counted in the budget caps and the 302(b) allocations, and too often this spending privilege is abused. Members of the House and Senate try to put programs which they cannot put in the regular budget resolution when this Congress sets its priorities under the emergency spending programs. We need to do what we can to maintain the integrity of that budget resolution because it is the one that puts restraint on spending and puts accountability in the budgeting process. 
   As I mentioned before, CBO has scored this as a no-cost transfer. It is important, and it is money that is left laying on the table. At this point in time, I really believe there are few choices of what will happen with the $12.2 billion. It will either go toward debt repayment, or it will be spent. I am concerned it will be spent. 
   I have introduced this legislation to obligate it towards debt repayment. It is important. I ask my colleagues in the Senate to support us in the effort to pay down the debt, and I ask them to vote aye to support this amendment to pay down the debt. I yield the floor.

   Mr. ALLARD. I, again, thank my colleague from Ohio, Senator VOINOVICH, for his undying effort and diligent fight to pay down the debt. It is good to have somebody with that kind of persistence and bulldog attitude to be a team player on a very important issue such as this. I just want to commend him in a public way for his efforts. 
   I do not see any other Senators on the floor wanting to debate this issue. I yield the floor so the Senator from Oregon can be recognized.

   Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I rise today to show my support for General John Gordon to be the Director of the National Nuclear Security Administration or the NNSA. But before I do that, I need to mention a related item, the lack of security protections at the Los Alamos lab. 
   On Monday, June 12, the New York Times reported that computer hard drives containing valuable nuclear weapons data and other highly sensitive information were found missing from the Los Alamos National Laboratory on May 7th. These classified hard drives were stored in locked containers in a vault at the weapons X Division at the lab. The containers were found but the hard drives are gone. According to reports, the material missing is American nuclear weapons data that the Nuclear Emergency Search Team needs to disarm nuclear devices during emergencies. Also missing is the intelligence information on the Russian nuclear weapons program. To make matters worse, the Lab did not begin an intensive search until May 24. I realize that a fire was raging in the area and  that people were focused on that, but to wait that long makes little sense. I understand that the law now requires that any such incident must be reported to the Department of Energy within 8 hours. Finally, DOE headquarters was informed of the missing data on June 1. 
   While it may seem premature to speculate foul play, I must say that neither DOE nor the Administration have a strong track record in the area of safeguards and security. Unfortunately, this is not the first incident of lax security during this Administration. 
   Here are just a few of the reported incidents. 
   March 1999--It was determined that the Chinese had penetrated Los Alamos Laboratory and stole our nuclear secrets. 
   Last December--A Russian diplomat is ordered to leave after a microphone transmitter is discovered on the 7th floor of the State Department, only a short walk from the office of Secretary Albright. 
   Then there is the case of the missing laptops at the State Department and the situation with the former CIA Director John Deutch, who since has lost all his clearances, of mishandling classified information. 
   While not all these cases are related to the newly created NNSA, they do show that a new attitude and new ethic must be incorporated into this Administration. We have had too many problems at too many places. 
   That is why I am glad that General Gordon is finally being voted on by this Senate. I am sorry that this vote took so long to take place. This vote was objected to by some who wanted to get a better deal on a few items in the Defense authorization bill relating to the NNSA. It was my belief there would be obstacles in this job, but I never believed it would happen before he got to the NNSA. However, now that the objection to General Gordon's nomination has been lifted, we can finally move this nomination. Gen. Gordon's position is far too valuable to be made a political pawn and the latest incident at Los Alamos proves that. 
   Also, I let him know that I don't expect miracles, I just expect our national security be treated as such. No longer should science and personnel matters out rank security. We must change this culture and I believe that General Gordon is the right person for this job. I want to thank General Gordon for his dedication and commitment to his country and for serving in this new position. 
   Lastly, Mr. President, I look forward to the hearings on the latest incident at the lab. For too long I have heard this administration crowing that they are taking care of the security problems, but this latest incident shows that their actions don't match their words. While this administration crowed they attempted to undermine what Congress had done last year to strengthen security in the Department of Energy through amendments in the Strategic Subcommittee of the Armed Services Committee. As chairman of that committee I was appalled at the action of Democrat members of the committee as well in their attempts to stop the nomination of General Gordon. We must and will get to the bottom of our nation's security problems.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I thank Senators VOINOVICH, GRAMS, and ENZI for agreeing to cosponsor this particular amendment. 
   As everybody in the Senate knows, I have been working for some time to put a plan before the Senate that would pay down the debt over a period of time. I have always been a strong proponent of paying down the debt. I believe Congress needs to live within its own spending restraints. 
   In 1961, Congress established within the Department of Treasury the Bureau of the Public Debt. It is an account for citizens to repay the public debt. Our amendment relates to the surplus from fiscal year 2000. The surplus projected by the Congressional Budget Office has been projected to be $26.5 billion; that is over and above what was provided for when we passed the budget last year. 
   There was an emergency resolution that provided for some spending, so we have already spent part of the $26.5 billion: $14.3 billion went to reversing the payday delays and moving appropriation spending back into fiscal year 2000, which was a procedural issue early on in the year. It took $7.2 billion to do that. We took $5.5 billion for agriculture relief and $1.6 billion for natural disaster relief, Kosovo, and assistance to the Government of Colombia for drug relief. That totals $14.3 billion. That leaves $12.2 billion that has not been obligated that is going to be surplus in this year's budget. 
   We have another estimate that will be coming in later on in the year. Very likely, there will even be additional dollars at some point in time over and above the $12.2 billion on which the Senate can make a decision. Basically, what we are asking with this amendment is that the $12.2 billion ought to go towards paying down the public debt. It is based on figures released by the Congressional Budget Office, and it is within the budget resolution that was passed earlier this year. It takes care of emergency spending needs. 
   I am asking Members of the Senate to support me in helping to pay down the debt. In recent years, we have had an unprecedented amount of surplus. The surplus has illustrated the importance of showing some fiscal restraint. Actually, the budget resolution we passed earlier, in both the House and Senate, is an agreement between the House and the Senate to stay within certain spending parameters. This falls within those guidelines. The only enforcement mechanism is our willingness to live by our own rules. 
   We are saying with this amendment that we ought to live by the agreement that was earlier arranged between the House and the Senate, and passed. And if there is any spending, instead of increasing spending, we ought to be paying down the debt. 
   The emergency spending is not counted for under the budget caps or the 302(b) allocation. In my view, the spending privilege that we had in the past years has been abused. We have spent more and not worked hard enough to hold down and stay within the caps. 
   The increased spending may ultimately threaten the Social Security surplus. We have all talked about how important it is to save Social Security. I have been of the view that if you pay down the debt, you can free up resources so that we can work at Social Security reform in future years. Obviously, it is not going to happen this year. 
   In my view, we cannot, in good conscience, continue to spend when we have such huge obligations that are facing us in future years, particularly in Social Security trust funds. The Congressional Budget Office, again, has scored this as a no-cost transfer. 
   The amendment appropriates $12.2 billion to an already existing account at the Bureau of Public Debt, which we set up in past years for taxpayers to pay into because this Congress thought it was important to the American taxpayers. 
   I am saying to the American taxpayer that you have shown a commitment to want to pay down the public debt. Members of the Senate and the House need to carry forward with their desire and their commitment and show an equal desire to pay down the public debt. This transfers money away from spending and locks it into debt owed to the public. 
   New estimates will be coming later on in the year and promise to offer similar opportunities for dedicating more of the fiscal year 2000 money to repay debt owed to the public.

   Mr. ALLARD. I compliment the Senator from Ohio for his hard work on this particular issue. It is a pleasure to work with the Senator on looking at fair alternatives to pay down the debt. This is important to future Americans. 
   People ask, how will it affect me personally? If you buy a new car, the Government is not competing with you for that money; or if you go to pay for college education, the Government is not competing with you for that money; if you buy a home, the Government is not competing with you for that money. It tends to hold down interest rates. That means it costs less. It costs less to get a college education, costs less to pay for your home, and it costs less to buy a new car. 
   It is important not only to the security of this country, but to Americans individually. 
   I thank Senator VOINOVICH from Ohio for his steadfastness in fighting this issue. It has been a pleasure to work with him and the other cosponsors on this amendment.

   Mr. ALLARD. I thank the Senator from Virginia. 
   Mr. President, I came to the floor to talk about the importance of the authorization of the Department of Defense. This is an important piece of legislation. I am not here to impugn the motives of some of the other Members of the Senate or to try to mischaracterize what their reasons might be for coming to the floor. 
   This is a good piece of legislation. Senator MCCAIN from Arizona is certainly a hero in my mind; he continues to be that. I know he is trying to do what he thinks is best for this country. I respect that. I think we have before us a very important piece of legislation. We should not put it at risk. 
   This is an authorization bill that increases, by some $4.5 billion, defense spending over what the President proposed. It is a 4.4-percent increase in real terms over what we spent last year. If there is anything we have neglected over the last several years in the budget, it is our defense. 
   We have been obligating our troops overseas. In fact, if we look at the record, between 1956 and 1992, our troops were deployed some 51 times. Between 1992 and today, we had the same number of deployments. At the same time we are increasing our reliability on our fighting men and women, we are cutting their budget. I think that is inexcusable. 
   It is time Congress recognized what the problem is that the President of the United States in particular recognizes: We are not appreciating the service of our men and women in the Armed Forces. 
   With this legislation, we begin to appreciate the dedication and hard work of the men and women who have been serving us in the Armed Forces. Again, I thank Chairman WARNER for allowing me another opportunity to speak in strong support of this essential bill for our men and women in the Armed Forces. 
   This bill is a fitting tribute for those who served, are serving, and will serve in the armed services in the future. The defense bill is simply too important to be mired in political goals but should show them respect and provide them the best defense authorization bill we possibly can.  
   The fiscal year 2001 Defense Authorization Act is a bipartisan effort. For the second year in a row, we have reversed the downward trend in defense spending by increasing this year's funding by $4.5 billion over the President's request for a funding level of $309.8 billion. 
   As the Strategic Subcommittee chairman, we held four hearings. The first hearing was on our national and theater and missile defense programs. The second hearing was on our national security space programs. We had a third hearing, the first congressional hearing on the newly-created and much-needed National Nuclear Security Administration, NNSA, and we had a fourth hearing on the environmental management programs at the Department of Energy. 
   In response to the needs we have heard during the hearings, the Strategic Subcommittee has a net budget authority increase of $266.7 million above the President's budget. This includes an increase of $503.3 million to the Department of Defense account and a decrease of $263.3 million to the Department of Energy accounts. 
   There are two provisions I will highlight which pertain to the future of our nuclear forces. The first relates to the great debate we had on Tuesday and Wednesday regarding the 
   amendment by Senator KERREY and the second degree by Senator WARNER. The original provision requires the Secretary of Defense, in consultation with the Secretary of Energy, to conduct an updated Nuclear Posture Review. It was in 1994 that we had the last Nuclear Posture Review. However, with the adoption of the Warner amendment, there is not in place a mechanism by which the President may waive the START I force level requirements. 
   The second provision requires the Secretary of Defense, in consultation with the Secretary of Energy, to develop a long-range plan for the sustainment and modernization of U.S. strategic nuclear forces. We are concerned that neither Department had a long-term vision about their current modernization efforts. Both of these provisions are important pieces of the puzzle for the future of our nuclear weapons posture. 
   A few budget items I will highlight include an increase of $92.4 million for the airborne laser program that requires the Air Force to stay on the budgetary path for a 2003 lethal demonstration and a 2007 initial operational capability; an increase of $30 million for the space-based laser program; a $129 million increase for national missile defense risk reduction; an increase of $60 million for Navy theaterwide; and an extra $8 million for the Arrow system improvement program; and for the tactical high energy program, an increase of $15 million. 
   For the Department of Energy programs, we increase by $87 million a program within the NNSA, which is an increase of $331 million over last year. In the Department of Energy's environmental management account, we decrease the authorization by $132 million. However, I will stress that this bill still increases the environmental management account by more than $250 million over last year's appropriated amount. 
   Again, I will mention a few important highlights of the authorization bill outside of the Strategic Subcommittee. There are many significant improvements to the TRICARE program for active-duty family members. The bill includes a comprehensive retail and national mail order pharmacy program for eligible beneficiaries, no enrollment fees or deductible, resulting in the first medical entitlement for the military Medicare-eligible population. I am very happy with the extensions and expansions of the Medicare subvention program to major medical centers and the number of sites for the Federal Employees Health Benefits Demonstration Program. Yesterday, the Senate, by a vote of 96-1, supported Warner-Hutchinson, which eliminated the law that forced military retirees out of the military health care system when they became eligible for Medicare. Now they have all the rights and benefits of any other retiree. 
   With regard to the workers at the Department of Energy, we provide employee incentives for retention and separation of Federal employees at closure project facilities. These incentives are needed in order to mitigate the anticipated high attrition rate of certain Federal employees with critical skills. Just today, we accepted a very important amendment which established an employee compensation initiative for Department of Energy employees who were injured as a result of their employment at Department of Energy sites. 
   As the Strategic Committee chairman, I believe this bill is the only vehicle to provide such an initiative for these workers and their families. I think that is very important. This bill is the only vehicle to provide such initiative for those workers and their families who work at the Department of Energy sites. 
   On Tuesday, this bill added an additional piece of funding for a memorial which should have already been built. The amendment added $6 million for the World War II memorial.

   Mr. ALLARD. Finally, I want to mention my strong support for the Smith amendment, of which I am a cosponsor. This amendment would prohibit the granting of security clearances for DOD or contractor employees who have been convicted and sentenced for a felony, an unlawful user or addict to any controlled substance, and any other criteria. To be brief, our U.S. national security is too important to risk by granting clearances to felons. We are all concerned about personal rights, but when it comes to security issues, these must override all others.  
   Mr. President, I thank Chairman WARNER for the opportunity to point out some of the highlights in the bill which the Strategic Subcommittee has oversight of and to congratulate him and Senator LEVIN for the bipartisan way in which this bill was developed. I ask all Senators to strongly support S. 2549. One of Congress' main responsibilities is to provide for the common defense of the United States. I am proud of what this bill provides for our men and women in uniform. 
   We must not be blinded by political motives when it comes to our men and women in the armed services. All of the issues that come before the Senate are critical, but I hope that when it comes to this bill, we will remember why we are doing this. This bill is not for us and our political goals, but for our young men and women in the armed services. 
   I see this bill as a tribute to the dedication and hard work of these young men and women--the same men and women I had the opportunity to visit a few weeks ago on the U.S.S. Enterprise.

   Mr. ALLARD. The Chairman made a good point. We need to run a comparison. The question the Senator asked is, Do we need to delay actions? The answer is, No, we don't want to unnecessarily delay action. But I think we need to have a responsible decisionmaking process set up. These are very complex issues. 
   There are a lot of issues involved. Hearing the Senator's comments sounds to me as if he would agree with what the committee has tried to do. They said: Look, these are complicated issues. We need to have a careful review. In fact, the Strategic Subcommittee, which I chair, has set up a process where we have two studies to review our nuclear posture of where we are and move into negotiations. 
   For the committee to be informed means we have to hear from the professionals who deal with these issues. They need to bring the information to the committee. 
   We represent the people of the United States in the Congress and the Armed Services Committee tries to represent those interests. We have to set up a process to do exactly what the Senator from Nebraska is talking about. 
   A lot has changed since the last posture review in 1994, and what was relevant in 1994 is not necessarily relevant today. We have new leadership, by the way, since that review. In Russia, we have new leadership. We have new leadership around the world. We have leadership that has changed even in this country. We need to reevaluate in the context of this new political environment. We need to reevaluate in the context of new technology, new positions as far as the nuclear posture is concerned.  
   This amendment is critical to protecting our country and stabilizing the world. We need to get the current crop of experts, military and civilian--it is proper to bring in the civilian role--to formulate recommendations given today's dynamic changes. 
   It seems to me the Senator from Nebraska would agree with what the committee is trying to do. We agree perhaps times have changed. As the chairman pointed out earlier, the law expressly prohibited the President. Now we are saying, with a careful Nuclear Posture Review, maybe we can move ahead and review some of these issues.

   Mr. ALLARD. Let me tell you what the committee was thinking, as chairman of the Strategic Subcommittee, when we looked at this and said we need to have a careful Nuclear Posture Review. The Senator is trying to imply there was a political motive with that. This committee, made up of Democrats and Republicans, said we need to have a careful Nuclear Posture Review and we need to look at the facts. We recognized that in 1994 we had a review. We need to go back.

   Mr. ALLARD. In considering this issue, we need to have a careful Nuclear Posture Review. It is not going to happen quickly. What the Senator from Nebraska wants to see happen in public policy where we would carefully evaluate where we are in comparison with the rest of the world is not going to happen in 3 or 4 months. It is going to take time. We have to have input from civilian experts. We have to have input from military experts. From a practical standpoint, it is probably not going to be an opportunity on which this President can act. Whether it is a Democrat or Republican President, whoever is in office next, I think the same policy is going to have to apply because the ultimate goal is to have a careful posture review and make sure we do not unilaterally disarm this country, that we do not make it more vulnerable than it is today. 
   I yield my time to the chairman of the committee.

   Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to point out that the START II agreement is not a unilateral agreement, it is a bilateral agreement. It takes the approval of both the Duma and the Russian leadership, as well as the United States. 
   Also, to clarify the record, in 1997 the Quadrennial Defense Review didn't include a Nuclear Posture Review. I think it is entirely appropriate that we have a Nuclear Posture Review. Since 1994, a lot of leadership has changed. A lot of technology has changed. Certainly I would like to see us move forward with disarmament. But it needs to be verifiable. It shouldn't be unilateral. I think those are two very important conditions as we move forward on the disarmament discussion. 
   I congratulate the chairman because I think he is moving forward with this amendment pretty much with the strategic committee; that is, we need a very careful Nuclear Posture Review. It should involve civilians as well as the military. 
   This is not going to happen quickly. It is going to take time. This should happen no matter who the President of the United States is. We shouldn't rush into these agreements until we fully understand where we stand and where our posture is. 
   I know we have some Members on the floor who may want to speak. But I say to the chairman that I think perhaps at this time we ought to have a little bit of review as to what has been happening here in the debate. I would like to take the time to do that and to clarify some statements that have been made in this debate. 
   Since fiscal year 1996, Congress has passed, and the President has signed, legislation prohibiting the retirement of strategic nuclear delivery systems--bombers, intercontinental ballistic missiles, and strategic submarines--until the START II agreement enters into force. This provision was designed to put pressure on Russia to actually ratify the START II agreement. 
   The idea was not that they were going to send back a counterproposal to the United States. Again, it would have to be considered by this Congress. This was not an inflexible position. 
   I point out that, for example, last year the law was modified to allow the Navy to retire 34 Trident strategic submarines. Moreover, the law has been and continues to be consistent with the administration's own policy. 
   We have heard quite a bit about the statement made by Gov. George W. Bush relating to U.S. strategic forces. What has been overlooked in his focus on the need to have a comprehensive review of our strategic guided forces is the statement that originally was made by Governor Bush. He said, ``As President, I will ask the Secretary of Defense to conduct an assessment of our nuclear force posture.'' Then he goes on to say, ``the exact number of weapons can only come'' after this careful assessment. 
   I think we are very much in step with what the committee has been saying, what George W. Bush would like to see happen, and what I hear the chairman of the Armed Services Committee saying he would like to see happen. 
   I would like to again review where we are with the Warner amendment. 
   The Warner amendment substitute would include additional items to be considered in the review required by section 1015, including whether reductions can be conducted in a balanced and reciprocal manner, 
   whether changes in our alert posture would enhance our security and strategic stability, and whether U.S. strategic reductions could adversely impact our conventional delivery systems, such as the B-52 bomber. 
   The Warner substitute amendment provides authority for the President to waive the limitations in current law regarding the retirement of the strategic nuclear delivery systems once the Secretary of Defense has completed the Nuclear Posture Review required by section 1015. 
   The amendment by the Senator from Nebraska, on the other hand, would not be consistent with a policy enunciated by Governor Bush, nor would it satisfy the concerns Congress has raised for the last 5 years. It could lead to misguided and uninformed reductions rather than a forced posture review based on careful review of all of our strategic requirements and how they relate to overall national military strategy. 
   I thank the chairman for his leadership. I pledge that I will continue to work with the Senator for disarmament, move towards disarmament, but it has to be bilateral and verifiable.

   Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I thank Chairman WARNER for allowing me the opportunity to speak in strong support of this essential bill for our men and women in the armed services. I believe it to be very fitting that we bring up S. 2549, the fiscal year 2001 Department of Defense Authorization Act, only 9 days after Memorial Day. 
   This bill should always be more than just a funding mechanism for today's military but a fitting tribute and to show our appreciation for those who served, are serving, and will serve in the future. 
   The Defense bill is entirely too important to be mired in politics. We must respect our military and provide them the best Defense authorization bill we can. 
   The fiscal year 2001 Defense Authorization Act is a bipartisan effort, and I believe we all did some essential heavy lifting in committee for our warfighters. 
   For the second year in a row, we have reversed the downward trend in defense spending by increasing this year's funding by $4.5 billion over the President's request, for a funding level of $309.8 billion. This results in a 4.4 percent increase in real growth from last year's appropriated level. 
   Last year as the Personnel Subcommittee chairman, I had the opportunity to oversee the first major pay raise for our military in almost 20 years. Now, I have the great privilege to serve as the chairman of the Strategic Subcommittee. While it is a tall order to fill the shoes of Senator BOB SMITH as subcommittee chair, I believe the subcommittee has had a very successful and productive session. Just like last year with Senator CLELAND, it is always rewarding to have a dedicated ranking member like Senator LANDRIEU. I want to thank her, as well as all the members of the subcommittee, for all the hard work they put into this bill. 
   The Strategic Subcommittee has oversight and program authority over the following areas: (1) ballistic and cruise missile defense; (2) national security space; (3) strategic nuclear delivery systems; (4) military intelligence; and (5) Department of energy (DOE) activities regarding the nuclear weapons stockpile, nuclear waste cleanup, and other defense activities. 
   During the last year, the subcommittee held four hearings. 
   The first was on our national and theater missile defense programs which showed that the DOD continues to have a funding-constrained ballistic missile defense (BMD) program. In this year's budget, the administration finally increased the funding for the National Missile Defense (NMD) program, but we found that all of the Ballistic Missile Defense Organization's or BMDO's major acquisition programs remain underfunded. Plus, we were very concerned about the lack of funding for the research and development technology programs. That is why in this bill we recommend substantial increases in funding for ballistic missile defense programs and technologies. 
   We also had a hearing regarding our national security space issues where we identified a number of areas in which budget constraints have caused DOD to insufficiently fund key space programs and technologies and technology development. We also learned from our extensive post-Kosovo conflict hearings that intelligence processing and dissemination was insufficient to meet some of our warfighting requirements. That is why we recommended funding increases for the National Imagery and Mapping Agency to improve the imagery tasking, processing, exploitation and dissemination process.  
   The Strategic Subcommittee also has oversight over two-thirds of the Department of 
   Energy's budget, including the newly created and much needed National Nuclear Security Administration or the NNSA. The subcommittee also authorized funds for the Defense Nuclear Facility Safety Board, an independent agency responsible for external oversight of safety at DOE defense nuclear facilities. 
   We held the first congressional hearing to assess the programs of the newly established National Nuclear Security Administration or the NNSA. We remain concerned about the science-based stockpile stewardship program and the fact that it could be 15 years before the DOE stockpile stewardship program can be evaluated as an acceptable substitute for underground nuclear testing. We are also concerned about the slow pace in re-establishing pit manufacturing and tritium production capabilities and any long-term requirements or plans for modernization of its aging weapon production plans. 
   The fourth hearing was in the area of environmental management. I am encouraged that DOE continues to make progress in focusing its resources on closure of a limited number of sites and facilities. However, just like in the area of space and missile defense, I am very concerned that funding requests for science and technology development continues to drop. DOE needs a vigorous research and development program in order to meet its accelerated cleanup and closure goals. 
   In response to these needs, the Strategic Subcommittee has a net budget authority increase of $266.7 million above the President's budget. This includes an increase of $530.3 million to the DOD account and a decrease of $263.6 million to DOE accounts. 
   In the DOD accounts, there is a net increase of $418.6 billion for the Ballistic Missile Defense programs, an increase of $98.2 million for advanced space technology, an increase of $190.0 million for tactical and national intelligence programs, and an increase of approximately $22 million for strategic forces. 
   There are two provisions which I would like to highlight which pertain to the future of our nuclear forces. First, we have a provision which requires the Secretary of Defense, in consultation with the Secretary of Energy, to conduct an updated nuclear posture review. It has been since 1994 since the last nuclear posture review. This is important piece of the puzzle when determining the future shape of our nuclear forces. 
   The second provision requires the Secretary of Defense, in consultation with the Secretary of Energy, to develop a long range plan for the sustainment and modernization of the U.S. strategic nuclear forces. We are concerned that neither Department has a long term vision beyond their current modernization efforts. 
   A few budget items I would like to highlight include: an increase of $92.4 million for the Airborne Laser program that requires the Air Force to stay on the budgetary path for a 2003 lethal demonstration and a 2007 initial operational capability; an increase of $30 million for the Space Based Laser program; a $129 million increase for NMD risk reduction; an increase of $60 million for Navy Theater Wide; and extra $8 million for the Arrow System Improvement Program; and for the Tactical High Energy Program an increase of $15 million. 
   For the Department of Energy programs, the budget structure we have proposed for DOE is slightly different from the Administration's request. We recommend that all activities of the NNSA appear in a single budgetary provision, as required by section 3251 of the National Defense Authorization Act of FY 2000. The bill has an increase of $87 million to the programs within the NNSA, which is an increase of $331.0 million over last year. 
   In DOE's Environmental Management account, we decrease the authorization by $132.0 million. However, I want to stress that this bill still increases the environmental management account by more than $350 million over last year's appropriated amount. In addition, we decrease the other defense account by $88.8 million and move the Formerly Utilized Sites Remedial Action Program account to a non-defense account, reflecting a decrease of $140 million. Finally, the bill also provides $34 million to continue progress on restoring tritium production. 
   I would like to mention an important highlight of the Authorization bill outside of the Strategic Subcommittee. 
   I want to commend the new Personnel Subcommittee chairman, Senator HUTCHINSON, for his work on the comprehensive health care provisions in the bill. There are many significant improvements to the TRICARE program for active duty family members. The bill includes a comprehensive retail and national mail order pharmacy program for eligible beneficiaries, with no enrollment fees or deductible. This results in the first medical entitlement for the military Medicare eligible population. I am also very happy with the extensions and expansions of the Medicare subvention program to major medical centers and in the number of sites for the Federal Employees Health Benefit demonstration program. 
   Lastly, I would like to point out a few items specific to Colorado. The Defense Authorization Act fully funds Rocky Flats at $673 million. Plus, we require that all safeguard and security activities to be managed by Rocky Flats, and not at DOE headquarter organization, in order to ensure that future savings will be used for additional Rocky Flats cleanup. There is also a provision asking for a report on, as well as encouraging the Secretary of Energy to use, the authority provided in last years DOD authorization bill which allowed him to use prior year unobligated balances to accelerate cleanup at Rocky Flats. Lastly, we also provide employee incentives for retention and separation of federal employees at closure project facilities. These incentives are needed in order to mitigate the anticipated high attrition rate of certain federal employees with critical skills. 
   Also, the bill fully funds the Chemical Demilitarization Program at over $1 billion, while fully funding the military construction for the Pueblo Chemical Depot at $10.6 million. For Pueblo's destruction of their chemical agents, there is a provision which provides for the destruction of the chemical agents at Pueblo either by incineration or any technology through the Assembled Chemical Weapons Assessment on or before May 1, 2000. The provision is to expedite the destruction activities by using one of the technologies listed in the National Environmental Policy Act documents for the Pueblo Chemical Depot. 
   Plus, there are $34 million for the procurement of precision targeting pods for the Air National Guard and I expect these funds to be used for such procurement. 
   Mr. President, I want to thank Chairman WARNER for the opportunity to point out some of the highlights in the bill which the Strategic Subcommittee has oversight and to congratulate him and Senator LEVIN in the bipartisan way this bill was developed and ask that all Senators strongly support S. 2549. I also want to thank Eric Thoemmes, Paul Longsworth, Tom McKenzie, and Tom Moore of the Strategic Subcommittee, all the Armed Services Committee staff, and Doug Flanders of my staff for all their long hours and hard work they put into this important bill. 
   Finally, one of Congresses main responsibilities is to provide for the common defense of the United States and I am proud of what this bill provides for our men and women in uniform. We must not be blinded by political motives when it comes to our men and women in the Armed Services. I look forward to moving this bill through the Senate, out of conference and to the President in order to quickly provide the much needed and much deserved resources for our military. To our Armed Services, I say this bill is a tribute to your dedication and hard work. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I want to point out that the Strategic Subcommittee, which I chair, has been realizing that times are changing and we need to reevaluate and reassess our nuclear forces. In fact, if you look in the bill, we have set up a couple of studies: a revised nuclear posture review in section 1015. Another is a plan for a long-term sustainment of modernization of U.S. strategic nuclear forces in section 1016. 
   We recognize that times are changing. But this is very serious business. When you are talking about a balance of power between the United States and the rest of the world--and in this particular case, Russia, the former U.S.S.R.--we are talking about very serious business. I don't think this decision should be made by one person. That is why we have set up this posture review process. We suggested it in the bill we have introduced in the full committee and now it is part of the bill. Apparently, this sort of mantle was picked up by Presidential candidate George W. Bush. An important part of his comments is that there be a posture review, a careful analysis of where we are with our nuclear forces. I think your amendment is carrying forward with what the Strategic Subcommittee suggests and the Armed Services Committee and even candidate for the Presidency George W. Bush. 
   I support the chairman in his amendment to ask for a posture review before we move forward. If I am not a cosponsor on that amendment, I will ask that I be added because I think it is very important. No matter who is President, I don't think one single person should be making these decisions without a careful review from those people who know what they are doing in the Department of Defense. 
   As I understand the chairman's amendment, it does call for that very careful review. There is one thing I would like to comment on before I yield. The Warner substitute amendment, as I understand it, would provide  authority for the President to waive the limitations in current law regarding the retirement of strategic nuclear delivery systems once the Secretary of Defense has completed the Nuclear Posture Review required by section 1015, which I referred to earlier in my comments. The amendment of the Senator from Nebraska, as I understand it, would not be consistent with the policy enunciated by Governor Bush, nor would it satisfy the concerns that Congress has raised for the last 5 years. It would lead to misguided and uninformed reductions, in my view, rather than a force posture based on careful review of all our strategic requirements and how these relate to our overall national military policy. I think the chairman is headed in the right direction.

   Mr. ALLARD. In my view, and the way I read the amendment--and I think you are missing the main point of the amendment--is that you have a careful review before making a decision. From a practical standpoint, hopefully, it is not going to be an easy decision arrived at. If you are using February as an example, I think it may be possible, because if you look into it, it says after the quadrennial review of 2001.

   Mr. ALLARD. The important point is that we have careful review of our nuclear posture. I think it should be done with a lot of consultation with a lot of different people, other than only the President and his immediate surrounding staff. I think the amendment of Senator WARNER does that. I think it is certainly compatible and consistent with what the committee has been thinking in terms of the studies they think are necessary, both in long-term as well as short-term posturing with the nuclear forces. Personally, I think probably there is going to be an opportunity for us to reduce some of our nuclear forces. But it has to be done with a lot of forethought and careful study. I don't think we are going to solve that on the Senate floor. I think it is going to take people who know and understand all the details of the program--both ours as well as throughout the world--to make this decision. I don't think it can be made quickly.

    Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, Saturday, May 20th was Armed Forces Day and I can think of no better time to honor those who serve this great county in the United States military. The millions of active duty personnel who have so unselfishly dedicated their lives to protecting freedom deserve the highest degree of respect and a day of honor. 
   I recently had the privilege of being invited to tour the U.S.S. Enterprise during a training mission off the Florida cost. My experience abroad the Enterprise reminded me of the awesome power and strength of the United States military. But more importantly, it reminded me of the hard work and sacrifice of the men and women serving in our armed forces.

    Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to establish the Great Sand Dunes National Park and the Great Sand Dunes National Preserve. 
   This legislation is a major step in protection and preservation of the Great Sand Dunes and San Luis Valley water. I along with Congressman MCINNIS decided to introduce companion bills at the request of valley residents, locally elected officials and the Rio Grande Water Conservation District. In an era of Presidential threats and questionable uses of the Antiquities Act, a locally driven legislative process is something I strongly support. 
   Anyone who has visited the Sand Dunes understands the unique feeling they offer the visitor, the dunes seem out of place--a contradiction in nature. The San Luis Valley serenely placed between the Sangre De Cristo and the San Juan Mountains is the last place one would expect to see 750 foot high sand dunes. Still, the Sand Dunes offered the early residents and explorers a unique look into the earth's geological wonders. This bill will help to ensure that future generations have that same opportunity. 
   Developing legislation that satisfies everyone is a difficult task, but this bill reflects compromises on all sides and puts forth a unique proposal for a complicated issue. The provisions of the bill allow for (1) establishing the Great Sand Dunes National Park; (2) establishing the Great Sand Dunes National Preserve; (3) the acquisition of the Luis Maria Baca Grant No. 4; (4) protection of San Luis Valley's water resources; (5) hunting in the new Great Sand Dunes National Preserve; (6) creation of a new National Wildlife Refuge and (7) a local advisory council. 
   Protection of the valley's water resources is very important to the citizens of Colorado and a primary motivation for virtually everyone's support for this measure. An integral part of the water component is the federal acquisition of the Baca Ranch. While I am usually very skeptical of additional federal ownership of land, it makes sense here to purchase the land from willing sellers and incorporate it into the combination park, wildlife refuge and forest. The legislation requires the Department of the Interior to work with the State of Colorado to protect the water dependent resources of the Sand Dunes while not jeopardizing valid existing water rights held by others. I want to assure everyone that this bill does not create a federal reserve water right. 
   The Great Sand Dunes National Preserve allows the Secretaries of the Interior and Agriculture to transfer existing Forest Service lands to the Park Service and manage these lands as a Preserve. The transfer would allow the Park Service jurisdiction of the watershed affecting the Sand Dunes, while not affecting the wilderness status or existing hunting in the area. As a veterinarian I understand and recognize hunting as an important tool in game management. The bill stipulates that the Colorado Division of Wildlife will play an integral role in continued game management of the area. 
   The bill also creates a new National Wildlife Refuge on the western edge of the existing Baca Ranch and adjacent state trust lands. This new Refuge will provide additional hunting opportunities in an area that has been historically closed to public hunting. It has extensive wetlands and is home to an extensive diversity of plants and animals, including a large elk herd. The Refuge would also give the affected county an additional source of revenue  through the Refuge and Revenue Sharing Act as an offset to the loss of property taxes from the federal acquisition of the Baca. 
   President Herbert Hoover in 1932 recognized the unique characteristics of the sand dunes and wanted to protect their scenic, scientific and educational features. With the support of the local community, the Great Sand Dunes National Monument was established. Now sixty-eight years later, residents of the San Luis Valley are advocating expansion and upgrade of the national monument to a national park. 
   Last December, I along with Senator CAMPBELL, Congressman MCINNIS, Secretary of the Interior Bruce Babbitt and Colorado Attorney General Ken Salazar met at the Great Sand Dunes to discuss the merits of expanding and protecting the resources of the San Luis Valley. We all recognized the significance of the meeting and vowed to work towards passage of a bill. 
   Our time is short in Congress this year, and soon I will be asking for a hearing in the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources. This is an important issue to Coloradans, and I look forward to Senate passage of my legislation.

    Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, today I honor a man who spent 48 years of his life serving the public as an elected official for the State of Colorado. A man who served 2 years as the president of Colorado's 35th school district, 6 years as a board member of the town of Palisade, 6 years as a member of the Colorado House of Representatives, 2 of those as House Speaker, 10 years as a Colorado State Senator where he was both the Majority and Minority Leader, and 24 years as a member of the U.S. House of Representative where he was the Chairman of the House Interior and Insular Affairs Committee. I am referring to the late Congressman Wayne N. Aspinall from the small peach and winery town of Palisade, CO. 
   Let me talk about Wayne Aspinall's time in the U.S. Congress. In 1956, as Chairman of the Subcommittee on Irrigation and Reclamation, he created the Colorado River Storage Project Act of 1956 which authorized Glen Canyon, Flaming Gorge, Navajo and Curecanti Reservoirs, plus several smaller projects authorized for construction and others designated for study. The act was signed into law by President Eisenhower on April 11, 1956. 
   In 1959, he became Chairman of the U.S. House Interior and Insular Affairs Committee. The ensuing 14 years of his leadership was viewed by many as the most productive in history in terms of new water projects, national parks authorized, wilderness designated, redwoods protected, the States of Alaska and Hawaii were admitted to the Union, and so much more. 
   This remarkable Congressman's accomplishments continued. In 1964, he lead the way to the Wilderness Act, which became law September 3rd and designated 9.1 million acres of wilderness and set aside more for study. At the same time, the Land and Water Conservation Fund was established primarily for parks acquisition. 
   Then, in 1968, he created the Colorado River Basin Development Act, signed into law by President Johnson on September 30, which balanced development in the basin. On October 2nd of the same year, his bill was signed protecting 58,000 acres of California redwoods and the Land and Water Conservation Fund was further enhanced. 
   Finally, he returned to his hometown of Palisade, CO in 1973 to live in a new home over the Colorado River which his life's work had done so much to preserve as a valuable resource for the entire western United States. He died October 9, 1983. 
   Now the citizens in his hometown plan to honor his memory with a one-and-half times life-size bronze sculpture by noted North Carolina artist Thomas Jay Warren. The statue will be the central feature of a Memorial which will include the representation of a dam and river. Several adjacent Memory Walls will be inscribed with the major achievements of the man known affectionately today in Colorado as ``Mr. Chairman.'' Members of the Wayne N. Aspinall Memorial created it as an educational one, designed as much to teach students and others of the importance of sound water conservation, good government, and the history of water in the West as a record of the Chairman's stellar accomplishments. 
   The $165,000 Memorial will sit in the southeast quadrant of what is now known as Palisade Park, on a bluff above the Colorado River about 50 yards from the home to which he had retired. 
   I commend the people of Palisade and other Coloradans for their effort to honor a man who served the great State of Colorado and our Nation with such distinction. I am proud to say that I knew him as a young man. My father, Amos Allard, was chairman of his congressional district. My family is proud of the affiliation with the Wayne Aspinall family and count ourselves among his many supporters. I urge all of who can do so to support this project financially.

   Mr. ALLARD. Thank you. Mr. President, frankly, I had no intention to come to the floor today, as I received a generous amount of time yesterday to debate my amendment concerning the national debt. I appreciate the chairman of the Budget Committee giving me some time to speak momentarily. After listening to the dialog today and reading the content of the sense-of-the-Senate amendment by the Senator from Rhode Island, I felt a sincere need to come and speak to you all this evening. 
   Since last April's tragic events in my home State at Columbine High School, the town of Littleton, it seems as though the students and community of the Columbine High School have been mentioned almost on a daily basis on the floor of the Senate in Washington, DC. This tragic event has become a new flag to be waved by those in this body who seek to further politicize the issues of crime, law enforcement, and the second amendment. I ask you, Mr. President, what has this politicking done to help heal the wounds in my home State? I have staff from Littleton. I have staff in Littleton, and I have staff in my State offices who will go home this very night in Littleton, CO. 
   This tragic event shocked the people in that community, and to date I fail to see any benefit to those in Littleton from the continued publicity and polarization coming from this Chamber. 
   I have with me two articles published this week: Denver Rocky Mountain News editorial documenting the April 12 visit of President Clinton to Littleton:  
   It would be utterly tasteless for any politician--from the President to local state representative--to attempt to make political hay over Columbine on the brink of its anniversary.  
   Washington Post Article ``Columbine, Reflections of a Painful Past'':  
   Students, parents and school officials here are viewing this anniversary with trepidation. They are apprehensive about the emotions it may rekindle--and about the crush of journalists and curiosity seekers expected to arrive.

   Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I rise today on behalf of myself, Senator ENZI, and Senator GRAMS, to offer this very important amendment to the budget resolution. Our amendment concerns the repayment of the $3.6 trillion debt owed to the American public. I am eager to join my colleagues in this important discussion about the Federal budget, the budget surplus, and the American Government's economic future. 
   When I was first elected to Congress in 1990, the discussion was radically different. The concept of a budget surplus, let alone long-term projections for a surplus, was foreign. The notion that a national debt measured in trillions could ever be paid off was practically science fiction. While 1990 was only 10 years ago, we stand on the floor of the Senate today a million miles from the bleak fiscal outlook of those times. 
   We must be careful. While our present fiscal condition may be rose colored, fiscal irresponsibility and a refusal to wisely use the budget surplus can not only lead us back to our deficit spending ways of the past, in my view, it will threaten the fiscal health of our Nation for yet another generation of Americans. 
   I am here today to urge my colleagues to address the responsibility that comes with the $5.7 trillion debt. During the 105th Congress, I introduced the American Debt Repayment Act. This legislation provided an amortization schedule for the repayment of the national debt. 
   The largest purchase an American family will ever make is the purchase of their home, and this expenditure is made possible because they laid down a plan on how to pay off this mortgage. It is a set schedule of payments. When I was crafting the American Debt Repayment Act, I studied this traditional form of payment and said, why doesn't this apply to our enormous Federal debt? 
   Now, 2 short years later, the outlook has changed somewhat, as the Federal Government has run and is estimated to continue to run an on-budget surplus. During the previous two budget cycles, we have witnessed an eagerness to spend more and more money. On-budget surplus dollars have become lumped into the appropriations process to allow for increased spending. 
   One result yielded by our time of prosperity has been the use of surplus  money to raise the discretionary spending levels, allowing Congress to shy away from making some hard choices. The willingness to spend surplus dollars is so strong, in fact, that when Congress adjourned last fall, there was no real certainty as to whether we would spend all of the on-budget surplus dipping into the Social Security trust fund. This, quite simply, is no way to run an enterprise--any enterprise. Plowing surplus money back into discretionary spending to the extent that Social Security money would be jeopardized is bad policy. 
   Today, I rise to offer an amendment that would not only provide an opportunity to control the impulse to spend surplus dollars but would eliminate the entire $3.6 trillion debt owed to the public, save over $3 trillion in interest, and protect the Social Security program from annual discretionary appropriation raids. It is simple legislation in the model of the American Debt Repayment Act, providing dedicated debt repayment over a 20-year period. 
   Beginning with the fiscal year of 2001 and for every year thereafter, this amendment requires that the Federal Government maintain a balanced budget. As most families and business owners know, you must live within your means. It provides this payment schedule I have described--I have it on this chart--so that, by 2021, we have paid down the debt using the on-budget surplus dollars. The on-budget surplus dollars have become lumped into the appropriations process to allow for increased spending. 
   And if you can live within your means, then you are assured better prosperity in the future because it is going to carry you through the ups and downs of our economy. 
   It is fair and equitable that the Federal Government, I believe, live under the same parameters. I believe this is the first and most essential step in Federal budget accountability and payment. 
   My amendment further provides that Congress must budget for a surplus that must be dedicated to the repayment of the publicly held portion of the debt. Specifically, again, in fiscal year 2001, Congress will be using $15 billion of on-budget receipts to pay down this debt. Every succeeding year, the amount of debt repayment must increase by $15 billion. So that in 2001 there is $15 billion toward debt repayment, the next year it goes to $30 billion, and then $45 billion. It increases in increments of $15 billion our obligation to pay off that debt, which is looking basically at the surpluses we anticipate over the years in our budgeting as we move forward. Every succeeding year, the amount of debt, again, is increased by $15 billion, so the amount Congress must budget for and pay toward the debt in fiscal year 2002 will be $30 billion, and then $45 billion, and so on. In this system, if it is adopted, by year 2021, the entire debt owed to the public will be zero. 
   We must have a plan to repay the debt, and we must have a repayment schedule, the same as you have on your home mortgage, and we will have the ability to cut taxes. A plan provides certainty and structure. I believe that anyone concerned with the national debt or tax cuts will understand the need for a responsible repayment schedule on the national debt. 
   In addition to the on-budget surplus payment required by this amendment, I have added language to require that until such time as serious Social Security reform is implemented, Social Security surplus dollars must also be dedicated to the repayment of the debt owed to the public. Every Member of this body is aware of the enormous obligation this country has made to present and future Social Security recipients. I believe the policymakers must address the future solvency of Social Security. 
   I am not here today, and my amendment is not drafted, to address the vital issue of Social Security solvency in the long term. What this amendment will do, however, is dedicate a surplus in Social Security dollars to debt repayment until the Congress can generate an appropriate long-term fix to the obstacles that stand in the way of this program. 
   I note that the 20-year schedule I have introduced does not account for the inclusion of Social Security surplus money to repay the debt owed to the public. I believe the only sensible use for these funds, until such time as they may be used to reform Social Security, is again reducing the debt owed to the public. Directing these surplus funds to debt repayment will only accomplish total repayment at an earlier date. 
   I must stress today, I offer a dedicated repayment schedule to eliminate the entire debt owed to the public in 20 years, without using Social Security surplus money. The use of Social Security surplus dollars will only serve to pay the debt down more quickly, removing the burden of the publicly held debt from Social Security in the annual budget process. 
   In recent weeks, the distinguished Speaker of the House and the President have talked a great deal publicly about seizing 
   this unprecedented opportunity that lies before us, and that is to pay down the Nation's debt. Testifying before the Senate Banking Committee in January, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan strongly urged Congress to use surplus dollars to pay down the debt. Chairman Greenspan stated:  
   My first priority would be to allow as much of the surplus to flow through into a reduction of debt to the public. If that proves politically infeasible, I would opt for cutting taxes. And under no conditions do I see any room in the long-term outlook for major changes in expenditures.  
   I think that very succinctly spells out where we should be. This dialog has been tremendously helpful in further drawing the attention of the public and elected officials to the importance of debt repayment. 
   As many of my colleagues can attest, and as I have experienced in my numerous town meetings around my home State of Colorado, this is an issue that the public understands. It is an issue of basic common sense, equity, and responsibility. This amendment is a call to action and accountability. It demands that this country and this Congress recognize the debt it has created. It structures a disciplined, fiscally responsible schedule for the repayment of our debt. In the process, it is my view that this legislation will serve to generate greater fiscal responsibility with every appropriation cycle, prevent future deficit spending, and save the taxpayer more than $3 trillion in interest payments. Now, that is $3 trillion that would be better spent on necessary expenditures, the strengthening of Social Security, and tax cuts. 
   I wish to compliment Senator DOMENICI, and the Budget Committee under his leadership, for working to pay down the debt. I recognize their sincere efforts in that regard. But during a time of unprecedented growth in our country, I think we need to seize the opportunity to make a firm commitment to pay down the debt. I am asking that the Senate take us a little step further in that process, and this American Social Security protection and draft repayment amendment--I haven't introduced it as a bill but as an amendment on this Budget Act--deals with several issues in order to further our commitment to paying down the debt. 
   First of all, it says we are going to have to balance our budget; that is, we are not going to spend more than what comes in in revenues. We are proposing a plan to reduce the national debt. The amendment I have before you talks about a $15 billion commitment every year in additional obligations to paying down the debt. We have a provision in there to preserve the Social Security surplus and to state, as Senators, that we are serious about saving Social Security, and that we are going to work hard for the long-term fiscal soundness of a very important program for our elderly in America, and that we are going to have an option to allow individuals to play a role in their Social Security accounts. 
   Then, we also have a very important provision that says, look, if the revenue projections don't hold up as anticipated, there is a means where the Congress will come back on a quarterly review of these revenues. If they don't hold up, we are going to have to cut spending. It is going to help ensure that when we make decisions as we did last year in the budgeting process, where we got to the end of the appropriations process last year and we weren't entirely sure whether we would have spent Social Security or not until our final figures would have come before us in February of this year--now, fortunately, those revenue figures held  up--we do not spend Social Security dollars. 
   I have a mechanism in place which protects our position so that when we say we are not spending Social Security dollars, we will have an opportunity to make sure we are protecting the Social Security surplus; that we are staying to our schedule to paying down the debt because we in Congress are going to go back and review it on a quarterly basis and then help assure the American people that we will stay on schedule. 
   We are moving into somewhat turbulent times. If you watched the stock market yesterday and the amount of oscillation it went through, it reminds us of how the economy is changing. 
   I am concerned that at some point in time we will be overly optimistic about our revenue, and if we don't have this particular plan in place we will find ourselves in trouble and back into deficit spending, which I think we need to avoid. We need to utilize this prosperous time in our country to pay down the debt, which I think is extremely important. 
   I think the Congress can do all of those things. We can have a schedule to pay down the debt. We can save Social Security. We can also have some provisions for tax cuts. 
   With a three-pronged approach, the American people will understand our commitment to their future. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I will take the opportunity to respond to some of the comments of the Senator from South Carolina and also to some of the comments from the chairman of the Budget Committee. 
   We all appreciate the effort the chairman of the Budget Committee has put forth in paying down the public debt. I think he is to be commended for his commitment. We have talked about the need to pay down the public debt. 
   What I am saying with this particular amendment is that we need to go beyond 5 years. We need to look at 20 years and put a plan in place. This is a minimal plan. We have over a $1.6 trillion budget. We are just taking $15 billion of it and saying let's commit each year an additional $15 billion to paying down the debt and that we ought to be able to do that. I don't care whether it is 15 or 10 or 7. Senator ENZI from Wyoming made the same comment. The important thing is that we have a plan to pay it down. 
   This is a legitimate plan. This is not just a paper transfer. The Senator from South Carolina implied that this is just a transfer on paper. It isn't. It is taking the on-budget surplus and using that towards paying down the debt as a minimal plan. If the Budget Committee comes up with more dollars they want to put aside for debt reduction, God bless them. Let's do it. I am all for that. But this doesn't prevent them from doing more if they want to do it. 
   In addition to that, we say, instead of taking the Social Security surplus and transferring it over to the general fund where it gets spent, hold it in a fund very much like the Domenici lockbox. We put it there, and we don't spend it. It stays in that fund until we have serious Social Security reform. Then, when we have changed Social Security, when we have saved Social Security, then we can relook at changing the law, where we have an automatic transfer of surplus and Social Security that goes to the general fund to be spent. We can look at the implications on our total debt figure. 
   What you have here is a minimal plan. If you start including the off-budget surpluses in the year 2001, you have a total debt payment of around $152.4 billion because there is $137.4 billion that comes in on top of the $15 billion we have in the minimal plan. Then in the next year, in 2002, we go up to $30 billion that we are using in on-budget surplus to pay down the debt. That is a minimal plan to pay it down by 2021. We add on top of that another $143.6 billion to bring it up to $173.6 billion at the end of the 2002 budget year. That is assuming we don't do anything to reform or change Social Security. 
   I think most of us agree that Social Security is going to have to be changed. We will have to do something to save it. I am saying, in the meantime, instead of leaving the money out there, leaving it vulnerable, let's use the money to pay down the public debt an additional amount so it doesn't get built into the spending patterns of the Congress and obligate us to programs we may not be able to afford if we go into a time period where our economy is going to turn down. 
   I believe our economy is cyclical. Right now, we are going through unprecedented growth. At some point in time, it is going to turn around. We are going to regret the day we didn't do more to pay down the debt to get us in a position to ride through those economic downturns when they occur. 
   I think this is an important provision. It is in no way intended to be critical of the efforts of the Budget Committee to date. It says we can do just a little bit more; instead of looking at 5-year increments, let's look at a 20-year increment for paying down the debt. We can do that in 20 years, by 2021. It says that in the process of doing that, at a minimum, we will save ourselves $3 trillion in interest payments. 
   It is a concrete plan. It doesn't eliminate the opportunity, if Members of the Senate want to have reduced taxes. It does not eliminate that. It has an enforcement mechanism. 
   Last fall, we got into a discussion in the Senate as to whether or not we were spending Social Security dollars because there was a disagreement on what the revenues were going to be at the first of the year, and we moved into February. We have provided that if our projected revenues don't hold up, we can go in and make adjustments on spending so that when we tell the American people we are not going to spend Social Security dollars and the revenues don't hold up, we won't spend Social Security dollars. We will have saved Social Security. I think it is straightforward budgeting. It is accountable. I think it is a step in the right direction. 
   I reserve the remainder of my time. I wonder if we have anyone further who wants to speak on the other side.

   Mr. ALLARD. If we look at it overall, we plan on saving, in interest over the 20 year period, $3.2 trillion. Now, if we look at our debt payment over 5 years in surplus, then we are going to be paying down our trust fund. In 2006, we are going to be looking at--let me get the figure out here--a total of having paid down the surplus in 5 years of $982.7 billion and a savings of the interest, which would be that much less since we have to pay interest on it.

   Mr. ALLARD. It includes the Social Security surplus. The bill sets the Social Security surplus over here, and says it will not spend the Social Security surplus unless we do Social Security reform. On top of that, you have the Social Security surplus. If we took 2001 and 2002, for example, when you include a Social Security surplus, it is more than $15 billion. It is $152.4 billion in 2001, and $173.6 billion paying down the debt in both those years. It is pretty similar to what the Budget Committee is doing right now.

   Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, my response is, we have 4-percent growth in outlays projected into the schedule that we have laid out. In reality, there are no program cuts. We make provisions for 4-percent increases. There is just a plan. It is similar to an amortization schedule for your home. If the family runs into problems, they can redo that plan to pay down the debt. But the key is that we have a plan to pay down the debt. We have allowed 4-percent growth in spending in that plan. I think that is reasonable.

   Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, the Senator from North Dakota indicated that we include Social Security in our provision when we say we have to balance the budget. That is correct. But he did not read the whole bill because if he had read another section of the bill, it shows we set aside the Social Security surplus and do not spend it. We do treat Social Security as an off-budget item, and we keep it there. It stays there until there is Social Security reform or we do something to save  Social Security. We all agree Social Security is headed for trouble. I wanted to clarify for the record that we do protect Social Security. 
   I point out in opposition to the amendment of the Senator from North Dakota that my amendment does more than what he is proposing. We have a plan in place that specifically saves Social Security, and we have an enforcement mechanism in there. 
   I plan to vote against the amendment of the Senator from North Dakota because I believe that unless we have the enforcement mechanism, all of this is a sham. We need to have the enforcement mechanism that says if our revenues do not measure up, we do not spend Social Security. 
   I thank the Senator from New Mexico for yielding to me so that I could clarify the record. I yield back any remaining time.

   Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I speak in behalf of the amendment. We are going through unprecedented good times. We ought to take advantage of this time and put in place a plan to pay down the debt. We do not have a plan to pay down the debt, and my amendment lays in place a 20-year plan to completely eliminate the debt. 
   By doing that, we save over $3 trillion in interest payments, and we also do not eliminate the opportunity to reduce taxes. In fact, I believe repaying the debt is the first step necessary in providing the structure to make further tax cuts. Repayment of the debt  owed to the public by requiring all Social Security surpluses be applied to the debt until we have Social Security reform is the proper approach. This is a minimal plan in paying down the debt. It will probably do more because the Social Security surplus will also go towards paying down the public debt.

   Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I rise to make a few comments on the Social Security earnings test elimination bill. Today I join my Senate colleagues in supporting important legislation that will benefit millions of American seniors who want to remain working after age 65 without facing a reduction in their Social Security benefits. 
   In America today there are roughly 800,000 Social Security recipients between the ages of 65 and 70. Under current law if you are one of those 800,000 Americans and you earn more than $17,000 this year you will begin to see a reduction, $1 in loss for every $3 earned over $17,000 in Social Security benefits. I think it is important to recognize that those being penalized are those who have been paying into Social Security their entire working lives. I have long disapproved of this punitive system that places restrictions on a person's right to work, and an employer's ability to hire the right person for the job. Too often Social Security is viewed as a handout, but for the vast majority of Americans this is an earned benefit that should not be subject to Depression-era work restrictions. 
   The Members of this body are familiar with the numerous obstacles facing employers, particularly small business owners, in these times of near full employment. In my home State of Colorado, our small businesses, hospitality and tourism employers are struggling to find experienced, qualified individuals even in these times of prosperity. Here in the Senate we have looked at increasing the number of guest workers visas and streamlining the visa process in an effort to provide employers with an opportunity to reach employees. While we will still consider these efforts, the passage of the Social Security earnings test elimination bill will allow employers to tap an eager and rich population of employees already living in every community in our State. Importantly, this legislation will put an end to a depressing practice that has forced working seniors to leave their jobs mid-year once their earnings threshold has been reached. Not only will America's working seniors be spared unnecessary grief, but these seniors and their employers will be free to develop stable, life-long working relationships. 
   The Congressional Budget Office has estimated that this legislation will cost $22.7 billion over the next 10 years. I understand that actuaries from the Social Security Administration have reported that this cost will be negligible over the long term. I mention this solely in the context that as we pass this legislation we recognize that this measure is associated with a cost. Congress must budget appropriately in response to this cost. Repealing the earnings limit is an idea whose time has come, whose time came years ago. Part of constructing good public policy is making hard choices. I hope that my colleagues will recognize that if we are not willing to assume the responsibilities of these costs in other areas of the budget we run the risk of continued fiscal irresponsibility that threatens Social Security and a balanced Federal budget. 
   Like many of my colleagues in the Senate today I had the good fortune to work on a precursor to this legislation when I served in the House of Representatives. During the 104th Congress I voted in favor of H.R. 2491, the budget reconciliation bill that carried a number of provisions outlined in the Contract with America. One of these provisions was the gradual increase of the Social Security earnings limit. In December 1995, President Clinton vetoed this legislation. I am thankful that today the Senate will pass this legislation overwhelmingly, insuring relief and increased economic freedom for America's seniors.

    Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, yesterday in Colorado, at the chapel of the United States Air Force Academy, our country buried a hero. 
   William J. Crawford, a recipient of the Congressional Medal of Honor, passed away March 15th at the home he built himself in Palmer Lake, Colorado. And while Mr. Crawford won the Congressional Medal of Honor--our nation's highest award--specifically for his actions during World War Two on a hill in Italy, he showed that the medal was well deserved by the actions of each and every day of his life. 
   On September 13th, 1943, Private Crawford and his 3rd Platoon, 1st Company, 36th Infantry Division were attacking Hill 424 near Altavilla, Italy. The platoon was pinned down by intense machine gun fire. Private Crawford, without orders and on his own initiative, singlehandedly destroyed the machine gun and allowed the rest of his platoon to advance. Later, the platoon was again blocked, this time from two enemy machine gun positions and small arms fire. Private Crawford once more went into action, destroyed both gun positions, and turned a captured German weapon on the withdrawing enemy, facilitating the company's advance. 
   As his Medal of Honor citation says, this was an act of ``conspicuous gallantry . . . . above and beyond the call of duty.'' But Mr. Crawford's sacrifice for his country went further. He was captured during the same battle later that day, and eventually served 19 months in a German POW camp. The Army thought he had been killed, and actually awarded his Medal posthumously to his father. It was not until 1984 that a ceremony was held presenting the Medal to William himself. President Ronald Reagan had that honor, at the annual commencement ceremony held at the Air Force Academy. 
   Every year, Mr. Crawford attended that graduation to present the Outstanding Cadet award. Because Private Crawford, even after his bravery, even after 19 months in a POW camp, and even after an additional 22 years of post-war service to his country, continued to serve his nation. After his retirement in 1967, Mr. Crawford took a job as a janitor at the Air Force Academy. It let him supplement his retirement pay, and--more importantly--kept him around the armed forces life, and in contact with the future leaders of our military, young officers who can always use a outstanding role model of sacrifice, service, and modesty. In his last years he was very active with children, speaking to and teaching them about WWII, and serving as a shining example of dedication and patriotism. 
   Mr. Crawford's life was one of service: from the gallantry in combat to the less intense but also important roles as mentor, community volunteer, scoutmaster, and role model. As that life ends, as we honor a departed hero, we also recognize the continuance of the memory and legacy of a life well lived. Thank you, Mr. Crawford.

   Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to authorize the Bureau of Reclamation to provide cost sharing for the endangered fish recovery implementation programs for the Upper Colorado River and San Juan River basins. 
   This legislation is the product of years of meetings between water districts, power users, state and federal government and environmental groups. It authorizes federal and non-federal funding of an Upper Basin Recovery Program for endangered species in the Colorado River Basin and the San Juan River Basin. The goal of the program is to recover the Colorado pikeminnow, humpback chub, razorback sucker and bonytail chub while continuing to meet future water supply needs in the Upper Basin states of Colorado, Utah, Wyoming and New Mexico. 
   To date, more than $20 million has been spent for capital projects to recover the endangered fish. Failure to recover the endangered species could result in limitations on current and future water diversions and use in the Upper Basin states. The legislation provides Congress and the Upper Basin stakeholders a finite Recovery Program under an authorized spending cap. 
   The legislation authorizes $100 million for capital construction, operations and maintenance to implement other aspects of the program that include fish ladders, hatchery facilities, removal of non-native species and habitat restoration. The cost sharing program authorizes $46 million of federal funds to the Bureau of Reclamation and the remaining $54 million will be generated from state contributions not to exceed $17 million; contributions from power revenues up to $17 million and the remaining $20 million from replacement power credit and capital cost of water. 
   The States of Colorado, New Mexico, Utah and Wyoming all support the program. Other supporters include: the Colorado River Energy Distributors Association, the Upper Colorado River Endangered Fish Recovery Implementation Program, the Environmental Defense Fund, The Nature Conservancy, Northern Colorado Water Conservancy District, Colorado River Water Conservation District, Southern Ute Indian Tribe and Colorado Water Congress. 
   It is critical to affirm the federal government's commitment to the implementation of the Recovery Programs. The bill reflects compromise on all sides of the issue and recognizes that protection of endangered species can coincide with water development and water use. The participants want to move ahead with this program and are willing to help share in the costs. I urge my Senate colleagues to support this important legislation.

   Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleagues in this important discussion about the federal budget, the budget surplus, and the American government's economic future. When I first came to Congress in 1992 the discussion was radically different. The concept of a budget surplus, let alone long term projections for a surplus, was foreign. The notion that a national debt measured in trillions could ever be paid off was practically science fiction. While 1992 was only eight years ago, we stand on the floor of the Senate today a million miles away from the bleak fiscal outlook of those times. But we must be careful. While our present fiscal condition may be rose colored, fiscal irresponsibility and a refusal to wisely use the budget surplus can not only lead us back to our deficit spending ways of the past, but it will threaten the fiscal health of our nation for yet another generation of Americans. I am here today to urge my colleagues to address the responsibility that comes with a five-point-seven trillion dollar debt. 
   During the 105th Congress I introduced the American Debt Repayment Act. This legislation provided an amortization schedule for the repayment of the national debt. The largest purchase an average American family will ever make is the purchase of a home. This expenditure is made possible through the use of a mortgage, a set schedule of payment. When I was crafting the American Debt Repayment Act I studied this traditional form of payment and applied it to the enormous federal debt. Two short years later the outlook has somewhat changed as the federal government has run, and is estimated to continue to run, an on-budget surplus. During the previous two budget cycles we have witnessed an eagerness to spend more and more money. On-budget surplus dollars have become lumped in to the appropriations process to allow for increased spending. We have seen the results yielded by our time of prosperity as surplus money has been used to raise the discretionary spending level, allowing Congress to shy away from making some hard choices. The willingness to spend surplus dollars is so strong, in fact, that when Congress adjourned last fall there was no real certainty as to whether we spent all of the on-budget surplus and then dipped into Social Security Trust Fund dollars. This, quite simply, is no way to run any enterprise. Flowing surplus money back into discretionary spending to the extent that Social Security money would be jeopardized is bad policy. 
   Today I rise to offer legislation that offers not only an opportunity to control the impulse to spend surplus dollars, but would eliminate the entire three-point-six trillion dollar debt owed to the public, save over three trillion dollars in interest, and protect the Social Security program from annual discretionary appropriations raids. It is simple legislation in the model of the American Debt Repayment act, providing dedicated debt repayment over a twenty year period. 
   Beginning with the fiscal year 2001 and for every year thereafter my legislation requires that the federal government maintain a balanced budget. As most families and business owners know, you must live within your means. It is fair and equitable that the federal government live under the same parameters. I believe that this is the first and most essential step in federal budget accountability and debt repayment. 
   My legislation further provides that Congress must budget for a surplus that will be dedicated to the repayment of the publicly held portion of the debt. Specifically, in fiscal year 2001 Congress must use fifteen billion dollars of on-budget surplus receipts to pay down the debt. Every succeeding year the amount of debt payment must increase by fifteen billion dollars, so the amount Congress must budget for and pay toward the debt in 
   fiscal year 2002 will be thirty billion dollars, forty-five billion in fiscal year 2004, and so on. If Congress can remain within the framework of a spending freeze at fiscal year 2000 levels the entire amount of annual payment will fit within the projected amount of federal on-budget surplus. 
   If this system is adopted, by the year 2021 the entire debt owed to the public will be zero. 
   We must have a plan to repay the debt. When we have a plan and a repayment schedule, just like you have on your home mortgage, we will have the ability to cut taxes. A plan provides certainty and structure. I believe that anyone concerned with the national debt or tax cuts will understand the need for a responsible repayment schedule. 
   In addition to the on-budget surplus payment required by this legislation, I have added language to require that until such time as serious Social Security reform is implemented Social Security surplus dollars must also be dedicated to the repayment of debt owed to the public. Every Member of this body is aware of the enormous obligation this country has made to present and future Social Security recipients. Policy makers must address the future solvency of Social Security. I am not here today, and my legislation is not drafted, to address this vital issue. What my legislation will do, however, is dedicate surplus Social Security dollars to debt repayment until the Congress can generate an appropriate, long term fix to the obstacles that stand in the way of this program. 
   In recent weeks the distinguished Speaker of the House and the President have talked a great deal publicly about seizing the unprecedented opportunity that lies before us--to pay down this nation's debt. Testifying before the Senate Banking Committee in January, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan strongly urged Congress to use surplus dollars to pay down the debt. Chairman Greenspan stated that his, quote, first priority would be to allow as much of the surplus to flow through into a reduction in debt to the public, unquote. This dialogue has been tremendously helpful in further drawing the attention of the public and elected officials to the importance of debt repayment. As many of my colleagues can attest, and as I have experienced in my numerous town meetings around my home state of Colorado, this is an issue the public understands. It is an issue basis common sense, equity and responsibility. 
   This legislation is a call to action and accountability. It demands that this country and this Congress recognize the debt it has created. It structures a disciplined, fiscally responsible schedule for the repayment of our debt. In the process it is my hope that this legislation will serve to generate greater fiscal responsibility with every appropriations cycle, prevent future deficit spending, and save the taxpayer more than three trillion dollars in interest payments. That is three trillion dollars that would be far better spent on necessary expenditures, the strengthening of Social Security, and tax cuts.

   Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I stand before you today to support S. 1134, the Affordable Education Act. I have been a long time supporter of the Education Savings Account. I believe that ESA's can be a very effective tool in helping parents have an impact on their child's education. The key to a child's education is parent involvement. As well intentioned as we may be here in Washington, no amount of money or regulation can accomplish what a child's parents can. I have worked and will continue to work to help provide parents the opportunity to have an increasing say in their child's education. I believe this bill will help to accomplish just that. 
   The changes this bill will make to the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 will provide flexibility and choice to parents. Parents who earn less than $95,000 a year can pay up to $2,000 a year per child into a tax exempt Education Savings Account. This is an increase of 400% from the current limit. Under current law, money that is payed into ESA's is only available to pay for higher education. This bill will make  money payed into an ESA available for parents during the K-12 years of education. This legislation gives parents the flexibility to use their money on anything from college tuition to books or computers if these supplies are utilized in their child's education. 
   If parents would like to send their child to a private school this money will be available. Some will say that Education Savings Accounts will just benefit the rich. I strongly disagree. This bill would move all parents who want to send their child to a private school $2,000 closer to that goal. If parents want to keep their child in public school they have their ESA available to pay for any additional fees or supplies that would help educate their child. 
   Education is a crucial issue. In January and February I held 63 town meetings in the state of Colorado where parents spoke with me first hand about their concerns with the education system. I receive many letters from parents sharing similar sentiments every week. They tell me they are having a difficult time paying extra fees to allow their child to participate in extra curricular activities. Education Savings Accounts can help those parents set aside money to pay for activities that help build character for students. They tell me that they are having to pay for school books that they cannot afford. Education Savings Accounts can help those parents set aside money to pay for the books that their child needs. They tell me that college is becoming too expensive. Education Savings Accounts help parents set aside money to pay for their child's college tuition so that they can graduate without worrying about having to pay off loans. 
   This bill also addresses other needs in the area of education. Local communities that pass tax-exempt bonds must pay the government the arbitrage, or interest, that accrues on those bonds. The Affordable Education Act increases the ceiling of eligibility for retaining bond arbitrage from $10 million to $15 million. This provides more money for school construction. Relief for graduate students is also included in this bill. The sixty month limit on loan interest tax deduction for graduate students is eliminated. This helps students who are unable to pay off their loans in five years. Employers are also allowed to provide up to $5,250 a year in tax exempt income to an employee attending college or graduate school for tuition assistance. Education Savings Accounts can be extended past the age of 18 for special education students who may not start college at the age of 18 like traditional students. 
   This bill will also provide a positive impact in other important areas. It provides tax relief which is very important to me and my constituents by reducing taxable income for families with children. I believe it can also reduce juvenile crime by allowing parents to pay for after school care for their child. This would allow children to be involved in activities during the time of day in which children are at the greatest risk of misbehaving, the time between the end of the school day and the end of the work day when many children are unsupervised. 
   We have an opportunity today to begin to work towards important reform of our education system. We have passed provisions similar to this bill in the past only to see the President veto them. I hope we can overcome this ``one-size-fits-all'' attitude towards education and pass the Affordable Education Act. Lets put the control back in the hands of parents instead of bureaucrats. I strongly urge all my colleagues to support this bill.

    Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President--I would like to take this opportunity to commend an outstanding student athlete from my home state of Colorado. Aleisha Cramer of Green Mountain High School has been named the 1999-2000 Gatorade National High School Girls Soccer Player of the Year. Aleisha's hard work and dedication earned her the prestige of being the number one soccer player of 246,000 high school girls across the country. 
   Ms. Cramer's athletic accomplishments include being the Parade Player of the Year, the National Soccer Coaches of America's Player of the Year as well as being accepted on the U.S. Women's National Team. Aleisha has lead her team to the State Finals for three consecutive years, winning the championship in 1997 and 1999. Not only is Aleisha an amazing athlete, she is honor student with a 4.0 grade point average, a member of the student senate and a volunteer for church and school groups. 
   It is an honor for me to recognize the achievements of this amazing young woman. Aleisha leads by example and her work ethic, talent and civic duties have made her a role model that any student can look up to. Aleisha Cramer has proved what hard work as a student, athlete and community member can accomplish. 
   Again, I would like to congratulate Aleisha Cramer, the 1999-2000 Gatorade National High School Girls Soccer Player of the Year, for her accomplishments. She has made the State of Colorado and this nation proud.

   Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, it is with great reluctance that I vote for the Work Incentives Act Conference Report. 
   A particular provision, Section 408, has been added to this important piece of legislation at a date too late to make further changes. Section 408 was introduced in the House, included in the Conference Report, but never debated in the Senate. I am a cosponsor of the Senate version of this bill. 
   In an effort to finish the first session of the 106th Congress we have had no time to sound our concerns and make due changes. Section 408 extends the authority of state medicaid fraud units. Not only would this provision mandate more federal control over what has been historically governed by the states, it also calls for investigation and prosecution of resident abuse in non-Medicaid board and care facilities. This provision allows the federal government unprecedented control over the quality of care in private institutions. This is yet another example of government authority exceeding its' boundaries. I have always been a supporter of state's rights and less government control and I feel these regulations are best promulgated by the states. Certainly they should not be promulgated in the final days of the session.  
   It is my opinion that we must reduce the amount of federal government regulation and not further impede the rights of care providers and state officials to monitor private industry. I make an effort to examine all pieces of legislation to ensure that the end results is objective and does not further burden individuals with undue regulation. 
   Again it is with great reluctance that I vote for this act. The changes made in the Conference Report at this late date are onerous and threaten the sanctity of private health care providers.

   Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the section of this amendment that addresses mandatory sentencing guidelines for handling powder cocaine. I thank my colleague from Michigan, Senator ABRAHAM, for his leadership on this particular issue. We have been working on this issue for well over 2 years. I know it is important to him. It is extremely important to me. I think he made a great statement, great argument for why we need to toughen penalties on drug dealers. 
   One of our colleagues who spoke earlier suggested perhaps we were not spending enough money on prevention and education and treatment. I have, in the meantime, pulled out a chart that shows how much money we have spent over the last 10 years in drug treatment and prevention and research. I would like to go over that for a moment for Members of the Senate. 
   Over the last 10 years, we have spent more than $20 billion on drug abuse treatment. We have spent more than $15 billion on drug abuse prevention. And we have spent, in addition to that, more than $1 billion in prevention research and more than $1.5 billion in treatment research. 
   We certainly have not been ignoring the treatment and prevention of drug addiction. The fact is, it is complicated. It needs to be part of the formula, as far as I am concerned. But if we do not recognize loopholes we have in the current law that allows drug dealers to continue to carry on their business at an extreme cost to society, I think we are ignoring our responsibilities, trying to address part of the drug problem. That means we have to have tougher penalties. 
   Currently, there is a vast discrepancy between minimum 
   sentencing guidelines for those caught dealing cocaine in the form of crack and those dealing it in the form of powder. Under current law, a dealer can be sentenced to 5 years for peddling 5 grams of crack cocaine. If you look on the chart, we have symbolized the amount of 5 grams of crack cocaine. In order to receive a similar sentence, a dealer would have to be caught with 500 grams of powder cocaine. That creates a tremendous loophole. What happens with our drug dealers is they will bring in powder cocaine and just before they put it out on the street for consumption by individuals, it is converted over to crack cocaine. That loophole encourages drug dealers to then import more powder cocaine. That is why I think it is so important we pass this particular portion of the amendment. 
   I have met with many different law enforcement organizations to look into this discrepancy. One effect of this discrepancy is what statistics show to be a racial bias in the sentencing guidelines. Mr. President, 90 percent of those convicted for dealing crack are African Americans. The majority of dealers caught with powder cocaine are white--58 percent of powder users are white. It is ridiculous that those who dabble with powder cocaine for all intents and purposes are protected by our sentencing parameters. Drug smugglers and drug dealers know about this caveat in sentencing and they do everything they can to take advantage of it. 
   Cocaine is largely transported in powder form and only converted to crack at the time of sale. This loophole in the current law actually reduces the long-term risks to dealers and smugglers. Drug enforcement detectives I have met with have confirmed the going price for 5 grams of powder and 5 grams of crack are typically equal now on the street. That varies considerably, but that apparently is the price right now. Why should we continue to support this disparity when we can solve it today? I believe one way to effectively decrease crime in America is to punish criminals through more rigorous sentencing, particularly when we are providing the amount of dollars we are today for drug prevention and drug treatment and research on drug prevention and research on drug treatment. 
   In order to receive a minimum sentence of 5 years, a criminal would only need to be caught with 50 grams of powder cocaine instead of the current 500. This amendment also stiffens the penalty for carrying a large quantity of powder cocaine. To receive a minimum sentence of 10 years, a criminal would only have to be caught with 500 grams of powder cocaine, instead of the current standard of 5 kilograms. 
   Henry Salano, the former U.S. Attorney for the District of Colorado, has endorsed this effort saying:  
   There is a strong rationale for equalizing the powder cocaine penalties and the crack cocaine penalties. The law enforcement community learned years ago the strong sentences meted out to crack cocaine dealers has had a significant deterrent effect on the production and distribution of crack. [These] proposed penalties for powder cocaine will likewise restrict the flow of powder cocaine in this country.  
   This comes from an individual who in the past has been on the front line, has been on the firing line, has been dealing with this from a hands-on position because of his position with law enforcement. 
   We must show criminals that any activity involving illegal drugs will not be tolerated. There is a direct correlation between drug use and crime. Cocaine plays a major role in this connection. A Department of Justice study in 1998 discovered the drug most commonly detected among all arrestees, from 1990 to 1998, was cocaine. Cocaine use poses a direct threat to the safety of our society. Let's stop treating those who use and deal powder cocaine as if they were special criminals. I ask all my colleagues to join me and end this inequality in cocaine spending. 
   I ask my colleagues to consider the issues in this particular amendment. I think we are taking generally the right steps in addressing our drug problem. Obviously, we are not doing it just on penalties, but we are doing it in all areas--treatment and prevention. This is an important loophole we must close. I ask my colleagues to join me in voting for this amendment and supporting this effort. 
   I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.

    Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to recognize and congratulate Bob Greenlee on the occasion of his retirement from the Boulder City Council. 
   Bob and his wife Diane came to Colorado from Iowa in 1975 and used their savings to buy a small AM radio station in Boulder. Through their hard work and determination, they turned that small AM radio station into KBCO, one of the top radio stations in the State. In addition to their work in radio, they have also helped bring several successful businesses to their community, expanding nationwide and employing thousands of people across the country through their enterprises. As part of their overall business philosophy, Bob and Diane have helped many others achieve their entrepreneurial dreams by assisting them in business ventures and startup companies. 
   The Greenlee's have also been an integral part of the Boulder community through their philanthropic work. Together, they founded the Boulder County chapter of the ``I Have a Dream Foundation'' which assists underprivileged youth achieve their goal of a college education. Bob and Diane have also endowed their own family foundation to carry on their tradition of philanthropy in Colorado. Their work has helped thousands of people across Colorado in their desire to achieve the ``American dream.'' 
   As the cornerstone of his community involvement, Bob served on the Boulder City Council for 16 years as the voice of common sense and reason. In 1997, Bob was selected on a unanimous vote by his fellow council members to serve as Boulder's mayor. As part of the city council, Bob's lasting legacy will be his thoughtful, reasoned voice in how a city should be operated. He views on frugality in the city budget and a common sense approach to city regulation will serve as an enduring reminder of his years of service to the community. 
   While he is retiring from City Council, Bob's interest in government has not ended. He currently serves as the chairman of the Republican Leadership Program. The program is aimed at teaching the fundamentals of our democracy and is used as a forum to discuss current issues that impact our everyday lives. His leadership has created one of the strongest programs of its kind in the country, and will serve to educate Coloradans on the need to be involved in the issues which face our state and our country. 
   Bob Greenlee has shown us all that the American dream can still be attained. He and Diane started by knowing that they could make a difference, and through their hard work and diligence, they were able to build their  lives in order to serve others. People like Bob and Diane Greenlee were the cornerstone of our democracy and must be recognized for their contributions to our society. 
   Mr. President, it is an honor and a privilege to recognize Bob Greenlee on his outstanding career and community involvement. I would like to thank Bob and Diane for their service, and wish them both much success in the future.

   Mr. ALLARD. I thank the Chair. 
   Mr. President, I thank the chairman for his very gracious remarks. It has been a pleasure to work with him on this particular issue. He is extremely knowledgeable, and it is because of his knowledge and persistence on this particular issue that I think we will pass such a good bill. I compliment the chairman in a public manner for the yeoman's work he has done and the great leadership he has shown on this particular issue. It has been a particular pleasure for me to be able to serve with him on the conference committee. 
   In regard to the conference report that is before the Senate, I think its provisions will be good for consumers and good for businesses. In regard to the consumers, it provides increased competition in financial services. That is good. It will increase choice for consumers. There is more convenience for consumers, and it will lower prices. Specific provisions in the bill also give consumers more information to better enable them to make educated choices. 
   The conference report, as I mentioned, is also good for business. It rewrites the outdated laws that have governed the financial services industry since the Depression. Gramm-Leach-Bliley eliminates the barriers between banks, insurance companies, security firms, and other financial institutions. This will increase efficiency, reduce costs, and increase innovation. American financial institutions will be better able to compete internationally under the new structures contained in the conference report. 
   Through the passage of this bill, Congress will rightly reclaim the authority to govern the structure of the financial services industry. For a number of years, various regulators have been easing the statutory restrictions between banking and commerce through regulation. By passing a comprehensive bill addressing the appropriate relationship among banking, insurance, and securities, Congress will ensure that the entire financial services industry is updated in a safe--and I would add that safe is very important to me and other members of the committee --and a consistent manner as compared to a patchwork of regulations. 
   Congress has struggled for many years with the best way in which to update the laws governing the financial services industry. One reason we are finally poised to modernize the financial services laws is the spirit of compromise and inclusiveness embodied in the conference report. Chairman GRAMM, and others, made a particular effort to listen to the concerns of the many industries involved and worked closely with the administration. The conference report does a good job of balancing the many interests involved. 
   I will now talk briefly about the structure within the bill. 
   The structure of the new financial services regime is based on a compromise between the Federal Reserve and Treasury. Bank holding companies will be able to engage in activities that are financial in nature, including insurance and securities underwriting and merchant banking. Well capitalized and well maintained national banks and insured State banks will be able to engage in certain financial activities. 
   Provisions will be enacted to ensure that the new activities are undertaken in a prudent manner. 
   The Federal Reserve is established as the umbrella regulator with strong functional regulation in all areas. This will allow consistent oversight by the Fed, while also allowing the individual regulators to exercise their expertise in the day-to-day operations of the affiliates that they traditionally regulate. The bill respects the rights of States through strong functional regulation and maintenance of non-discriminatory State laws. 
   Unitary thrifts prior to May 4, 1999, are grandfathered in under this bill. Existing unitary thrift companies may only be sold to financial companies. 
   Privacy is important to many consumers, and the conference report takes important steps to protect the privacy of Americans. Financial institutions must disclose to the consumer their privacy policy regarding the sharing of non-public personal information with both affiliates and third parties. The disclosure will take place when a consumer initially opens an account and annually thereafter. This is an important tool for consumers to make an informed decision as to which financial institutions they wish to patronize. Just as some consumers choose a bank based on the hours they are open or the branch locations, those consumers for whom privacy is a key issue can make an informed decision based on a bank's privacy policy. 
   Financial institutions cannot share account numbers or access numbers, except as required for consumer reporting agencies, for example, credit bureaus. Consumers will receive an opportunity to opt-out of information sharing programs. This means that generally consumers can prohibit a bank from sharing their non-public personal information with non-affiliated third parties. If any State law or regulation provides greater consumer privacy protections, then it shall remain in effect for that state. This is an important provision. 
   Changes to the Federal Home Loan Bank system will update their capital structure and expand access for small banks. This will be particularly beneficial to the many small banks in Colorado and other States. 
   One of the most controversial aspects of the bill has been the Community Reinvestment Act, or CRA. The bill clearly does not repeal any part of the existing CRA law, in fact it explicitly states that fact in the conference report. 
   The sunshine provision will finally bring some oversight to CRA agreements. For the first time ever, CRA agreements will be made public. The parties to the CRA agreement will also have to disclose annually what happened to the cash and other resources that were part of the CRA agreement. Congress decided that community reinvestment was a priority when it passed the initial CRA laws. This provision takes the next logical step and ensures that the cash and resources received by a nongovernmental person or entity are in fact used for community reinvestment. 
   The Gramm-Leach-Bliley bill makes several modifications to the CRA examination schedule in order to provide  regulatory relief for small banks. It is important to note, though, that the banks must still meet the same CRA standards--this only changes the examination schedule. A small bank that received an outstanding rating in its last CRA exam will not receive another CRA exam for five years. A small bank that received a satisfactory rating will not receive another CRA exam for four years. This relief is important for small banks, as the cost of regulatory compliance is disproportionately high for them. The relatively high cost to small banks for CRA compliance actually leaves them with fewer resources to invest in their communities. The examination schedule also makes sense because it will allow CRA compliance officers to focus time and resources on those banks with compliance problems, rather than the banks that are already doing a good job. 
   The conference report also contains a provision important for small banks--a GAO study on changes to the S Corporation rules for small banks. Subchapter S corporations do not pay corporate income taxes--earnings are passed through to the shareholders where income taxes are paid, eliminating the double taxation of corporations. Congress previously made small banks eligible for S Corporation status, however, many of the current rules make it difficult for them to qualify. I strongly support efforts to change the laws so that small banks are better able to qualify for S Corporation status. I am hopeful that this GAO study will highlight the need for such changes. 
   I will continue to push for those changes in future Congresses. I have introduced legislation in that regard. This is not under the jurisdiction of the Banking Committee, but the Finance Committee. I think it will be a key part in allowing small banks to move forward with their modernization efforts, in addition to this particular bill. 
   I stand in strong support of this conference report. I stand in support of the bill. I think it is going to be a key piece of legislation passed in this particular Congress. 
   I thank the chairman for allowing me to participate in the process as much as he did. I congratulate him on a job well done and encourage Members of the Senate to vote for this conference report.

   Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I wish to engage my esteemed colleague, Senator GRAMM, in a brief colloquy to clarify two items pertaining to title V, subtitle A. First Mr. President, is it Chairman GRAMM's understanding that the term ``nonpublic personal information'' as that term is defined in section 509(4) of title V, subtitle A, applies to information that describes an individual's financial condition obtained from one of the three sources as set forth in the definition, and by example would include experiences with the account established in the initial transaction or other private financial information?

   Mr. ALLARD. The second item relates to an amendment to the Fair Credit Reporting Act, ``FCRA'' in 506(b) of title V, subtitle A. Mr. President, it is my understanding that striking the FCRA's outright prohibition on various agencies drafting trade regulation rules or other regulations is intended to allow for these agencies to fulfill  their mandate under this title to issue regulations. The deletion leaves the law silent on the issue of agencies issuing regulations outside of this title, and it should not be construed to mean that an agency now has a mandate to issue any such regulations. Mr. President, does the distinguished chairman of the Banking Committee, Mr. GRAMM, share this view of the provision?

   Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, in the Summer of 1998, I met with a group of concerned citizens from the Overland Park neighborhood, which is located in southwest Denver. The dozen or so residents had requested a meeting with me to discuss an issue that had taken up more than six years of their lives and had driven them to distrust anything the Environmental Protection Agency had told them about a Superfund site located in their neighborhood called Shattuck. 
   The story surrounding the Shattuck Superfund site and what the EPA did to this community will have a lasting impact not only on the residents of the  Overland Park neighborhood, but on each and everyone of us who look for the EPA to be the guardian of our nation's environmental health and safety. 
   For those who have not followed the Shattuck case, these are the facts that have been uncovered thus far. In 1991, the local Region 8 EPA office and the Colorado Department of Health began to look at possible remedies for the cleanup of the old S.W. Shattuck Chemical Company located on South Bannock Street in Denver. Initially, it was determined that the safest and most effective cleanup was removal of the radioactive waste to a registered storage facility in Utah. But following a secret meeting between Shattuck's attorneys, EPA and the Colorado Department of Health the decision was made to store the waste on-site. Residents in the area were never told that the remedy chosen by the EPA had never been used before anywhere in the United States, and more importantly documents calling into question the reliability of the remedy were kept from the public. In 1993, the EPA signed the Record of Decision (ROD) and the radioactive waste at the Shattuck Superfund site was entombed on-site. 
   Over the next five years the citizens of Overland Park fought to get their neighborhood back. They petitioned the EPA for a review of the decision and were denied. They attempted to submit new information about the safety of the remedy selected and were told by the EPA the remedy was safe. Finally, last summer the residents concerns were brought to my attention. After meeting with area residents and business owners, I determined their questions deserved answers and together we began a journey to find the truth about Shattuck. 
   Last October, I asked the EPA to meet with the community to answer their questions and was informed they would not conduct such a public meeting. Outraged by their answer, I exercised my right as a U.S. Senator to hold up Senate confirmation of a key EPA official. The move resulted in the EPA agreeing to my request for an independent investigation of Shattuck by the National Ombudsman. Earlier this year he began his investigation and quickly determined the claims made by residents were not only meritorious, but that EPA officials had engaged in an effort to keep documents hidden from the public. 
   In fact, the Ombudsman was so successful at uncovering the facts surrounding Shattuck, his investigation has resulted in EPA officials now looking at eliminating his office. A meeting was recently held among all ten EPA regional administrators and staff from EPA Administrator Carol Browner's office to discuss eliminating the Ombudsman position. This can not be allowed to happen! Nor will I allow it to happen. Without the Ombudsman's investigation on Shattuck the residents of Overland Park would have never learned the truth. The Ombudsman's investigation brought integrity back into the process. 
   The EPA's efforts to curtail the Ombudsman's independence is an attempt to seek revenge for the on-going Shattuck investigation and to intimidate citizens who dare question the answers they are given by the EPA. I have recently introduced Senate Bill 1763, the ``Ombudsman Reauthorization Act of 1999,'' which will preserve the office of the National Ombudsman. The battle to enact this legislation could be tougher than getting the EPA to admit they made a mistake at Shattuck.

Amendments to the bill are expected to be offered during the postcloture debate, and therefore Senators can expect votes throughout the day. The Senate may also begin consideration of the conference report to accompany the financial services modernization bill during today's session of the Senate. It is hoped the Senate can complete action on the African trade bill and the financial services conference report by tomorrow's session. It is also still possible an agreement can be reached regarding the bankruptcy reform bill so the Senate can consider that legislation prior to the impending adjournment.

   Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I am not going to ask for a recorded vote against S. 688, the re-authorization of the Overseas Private Investment Corporation. But I want to make it clear that I am not stepping back from my philosophies on this issue. 
   During my campaign for the United States Senate, I stressed the themes of balancing the budget, congressional reform, making government smaller, and moving the power out of Washington and into the states and localities. That is why I introduced the ``Overseas Private Investment Corporation Termination Act.'' 
   I still fee it is time to end this form of subsidies for large companies. I have never believed in giveaway programs. Whether you are a farmer or a large corporation you should play by the rules of the free market system. Less government should be in the motto of this and every Congress. 
   OPIC may seem to have a good end goal but the problem is not the end but the means. Basically this is an insurance program run by the Federal Government for corporations who want to invest in risky political situations. This leads to the question, ``Is this the appropriate role for government?'' I don't believe so. But I also understand that the time is not yet ripe for ending this program. 
   I have met with the President of OPIC, George Munoz. He and I have agreed that our problem is not a conflict of interest, not different goals, and not a lack of proper communication. We merely have a fundamental philosophical difference. I believe free trade means free trade, not ``more free than others.'' 
   I am a free trader. I am a supporter of the GATT and NAFTA. I believe that free trade is the best way to raise the living standards for all Americans. We need to support policies that reduce trade barriers. OPIC does not reduce trade barriers for all companies to compete in the marketplace. It is an income transfer program from U.S. taxpayers to a selected group of businesses. These subsidies may increase exports for a few selected companies that have the political influence to secure these loans, but it does little to expand the overall economic growth of this country. 
   OPIC's re-authorization will soon pass this Senate, but I wish it to be known that I still recommend its termination. I continue to worry that the majority of my colleagues will not fully understand the detrimental potentialities of this organization until the American taxpayer is stuck with a tremendous bill.

    Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, today, I would like to recognize an individual that has been a tremendous asset to my office--Maj. Tim Coy. For the past year, Major Coy has been an Air Force Legislative Fellow in my office. He has proven to be a professional officer, who handles any task he is given with enthusiasm and tenacity. 
   A year ago I requested a sharp military officer be assigned to my staff because of my new position on the Senate Armed Services Committee. Once we interviewed Tim, we knew that his extensive space and missile expertise would benefit my committee assignments, and his knowledge of Colorado would also be invaluable. 
   From Tim's first day in the office, he blended in with my talented staff and went to work. He assisted in all areas of the office. He played a major role with our defense team on committee work, floor speeches, and became a point person for missile defense issues. Just as important, he became more than a one year staffer, but a friend to us all. 
   In closing, Tim is an exceptionally capable and professional military officer. He is the very first fellow I have hired, and one of the reasons I look forward to bringing in another fellow for next year. He has a bright future in the Air Force and I know I will be hearing great things about him in the future. Not only was I proud to have Maj. Tim Coy as a ``member'' of my staff, but he also did the Air Force proud.

   Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, this morning the Senate will be in a period of morning business until 10:30 a.m. By previous consent, the Senate will then begin consideration of H.R. 434, the African trade bill. It is the hope of the majority leader that the Senate can complete action on the bill prior to the close of business on Friday. Therefore, Senators are encouraged to work with the bill managers if they intend to offer amendments. The Senate may also consider any legislative or executive items cleared for action during today's session of the Senate. 
   I thank my colleagues for their attention. 
   I note the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I come to the floor of the Senate today to recognize the passing of a colleague and a very dear friend, Senator JOHN CHAFEE of Rhode Island, and to express my condolences to his lovely wife Virginia and their family. 
   I was just elected to the Senate in 1996 and found I had the opportunity to serve on two committees with Senator CHAFEE. He continued to serve as chairman of the Committee on Environment and Public Works, and I also served with him on the Intelligence Committee. 
   I will take a moment here to recognize my good friend's accomplishments in life and how much I appreciated serving with him in the Senate. He was truly a remarkable individual. He graduated from Yale and then got a law degree from Harvard in 1950. He served in the Marine Corps as well as being Secretary of the Navy. He was a patriot, a hero, serving this country's interests in World War II and Korea. 
   My wife and I had an opportunity to join him and Virginia at a dinner when I was just elected to the Senate and had just joined his committee. I think it was Senator INHOFE who said he traditionally held dinners for new members of his committee. I got an opportunity to visit with him about some of his experiences, and he was a delight to visit with, as was his wife Virginia. We had a great time that evening. 
   Senator CHAFEE worked hard on Social Security issues. He was a leader on health care. In fact, he worked in the subcommittees on both of those issues in Finance, and then as chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee. I found he was extremely fair and encouraging, somebody who could work with Republicans and Democrats. 
   Even though I disagreed with him, as I found 
   myself at times disagreeing with him because I did represent a Western State with some different views, particularly in regard to water, in committee he always gave me a fair chance. He gave me an opportunity to express my views and to represent the citizens of Colorado. I really did appreciate him for his fairness. 
   He did a lot to help me be effective in that committee. He made sure, wherever possible, if he could work with me on environmental issues that were important to Colorado, he did that. 
   I had an opportunity, which I took, to move from that committee to Armed Services. Even though I did not continue to serve on the Environment and Public Works Committee with him, he continued to be helpful and whenever I had environmental concerns I brought them to his committee. I appreciated his commitment to being a team player and helping everybody in the Senate. 
   JOHN was a great person; he was a nice person; he was a helpful person. I will continue to remember his dedication. 
   Just to show how he grew on you, I like to look at his achievements in elected office. He ran for Governor in 1962 and was elected by a mere 398 votes. Then in 1964 and 1966, 2 years and 4 years after he originally ran for Governor, he won both times by the largest margins in that State's history. Not only did he grow on those who knew him personally, but in his public service he grew on those whom he represented. In fact, when he was elected, he became the only Republican to be elected to the Senate from Rhode Island in the past 68 years, and he served 4 terms in that capacity. 
   He was, indeed, a public servant, somebody who worked hard on environmental issues. At times I found I could agree with him, and I recognized his efforts on conservation and open space preservation. I also recognized his dedication and work on the Intelligence Committee. The Intelligence Committee is one of those committees where much of what we do is not shared with the public. I want the public to know today, Senator JOHN CHAFEE was a valuable resource on that committee, considering his experience in World War II, his experience in Korea, and having been Secretary of Navy. 
   I will always remember Senator CHAFEE as a friend. I want his family to know my wife Joan and I will miss him. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, before making my comments on the campaign finance reform measure before us, I thank the Senator from Kentucky for his splendid work on this issue. This has been an issue on which he has spent a good deal of time. An issue this complicated is very demanding. As so frequently is the custom of the Senator from Kentucky, he has put his heart and soul into this issue. Many of us appreciate his dedicated effort in trying to deal with this issue in a very responsive manner. It is characteristic of the Senator from Kentucky to do this kind of work for the Senate. We all appreciate and respect him for it. 
   The Denver Rocky Mountain News ran an editorial on September 21st in response to the passage of the Shays/Meehan bill, expressing the paper's belief that soft money campaign contributions are a form of political expression and, as such, are protected by the First Amendment. 
   I don't bring this up now as a part of the Senate debate on campaign finance reform just because The News is a local paper. I am bringing this editorial up now because it is from a local paper with an exceedingly sound view. 
   In the editorial they use an example of an average citizen who might decide to distribute leaflets against a city pot hole problem. If this hypothetical citizen is stopped from doing so by a city council, it would be a clear-cut violation of freedom of speech. 
   The editorial then goes on, correctly, to explain that the difference between this simple form of election activity control and the kinds contained in the two main campaign finance measures considered on the Hill this year--Shays/Meehan and McCain/Feingold--is merely a difference of degrees, not type. 
   Donors who want to give to the Republican National Committee or the Democrat National Committee are expressing their political views.

   Mr. ALLARD. As the Supreme Court has ruled, political spending equals political expression. Attempting to stop this political expression, however distasteful some might find soft money, is an attempt to stifle activities protected by the Constitution. And so it is our duty as legislators to find a better--a constitutional--way. 
   ``Don't let perfect be the enemy of good'' is an expression we hear often on this matter. It's a slogan urging baby steps: small moves toward a distant goal. 
   The thought is that a soft money ban is one part of a move towards an ideal campaign finance system, and is part of an incremental process of improvement. 
   But alone, it is not good. It's not even merely average. Banning soft money will only give us different and arguably worse evils. 
   Let's take a look at just a few of them: 
   First, in some of my colleagues' minds it is a step towards taxpayer financed elections. This would be an absolute monstrosity with the bureaucracy calling the shots on campaigns. Our democratic process is voluntary and fiercely competitive. 
   Mandating completely taxpayer financed campaigns would force citizens to support candidates they disagree with, it would place bureaucrats in the position of legitimizing political candidates, and it unjustly allows candidates influence beyond their natural appeal to voters. 
   Let me explain also that I feel that a soft money ban is biased. 
   It might just be coincidental that the Republican caucus is leading the opposition to this bill instead of the Democrat caucus, but it might also have something to do with the fact that a ban on party soft money will ultimately benefit Democrat candidates over Republican ones. 
   If political parties are curbed, the Democrats already have a cohesive constituency ready and able to step up and assume party functions. Organized labor is just that--coordinated people ready to work. They are also ready to spend. 
   Senators SNOWE and JEFFORDS were kind enough to provide us all with a copy of the October 12th Washington Post article covering the announcement by the AFL-CIO that they were going to spend $46 million on the upcoming elections. 
   I don't begrudge the Democrat National Committee this labor and funding base, but it is unbalanced and blatantly partisan to attempt to shield this type of spending while attacking its counterbalancing force, the areas where the RNC instead has the advantage. 
   The natural constituencies of each party tend to balance each other out, but they do so in different ways. 
   If you will excuse this minor diatribe, I want to digress here for a moment and lament what seems so obvious to everyone and that is organized labor is not a Republican constituency. 
   I support the American worker. My party supports the American worker. We are the party of the individual worker, not a worker controlled by government. 
   In a more perfect world--of course, meaning a world that runs more according to my beliefs--the Republican agenda would be passed and would aid American workers tremendously. 
   The tax refund bill pushed by the Republican majority would have passed and returned money to taxpayers, also known as American workers. 
   The legislation I offered last year to pay down the debt would have benefitted all American workers in myriad ways. 
   The Social Security lock box would have passed and guaranteed this benefit for American workers. 
   I am therefore a little perturbed that the leaders of organized labor are so adamant against goals which I feel will greatly benefit the workers of America. 
   The nature or our political differences has resulted in the current situation where there is no other single entity willing to be so dedicated to a single party. 
   The Republican Party counters this absence by seeking contributions from diverse sources. Once these individuals give to the candidates they support, because they have not been coerced into giving and are without the option of labor unions to further spread their general message, they give to the Republican National Committee. To try and ``un-level'' the whole playing field by denying one side an outlet for political expression and clout, even if the objection is based an abhorrence of fund raising, is flagrant factionalism. 
   It is also, as I have said, unconstitutional.  
   The Supreme Court, in the case we are hearing about a lot this week, Buckley v. Valeo, said just that. 
   The Supreme Court struck down spending levels, because, and I quote, ``So long as persons and groups eschew expenditures that 
   in express term advocate the election or defeat of clearly identified candidate, they are free to spend as much as they want to promote the candidate and his views.'' 
   They allowed campaign donation limits, not because they did not interfere with First Amendment rights, but because the interference they impose can be grudgingly tolerated in light of the overriding interest in ensuring clean and fair elections. 
   To further limit soft money donations, or to attempt a different way to cut campaign spending, both of which a ban on party soft money would do, there must first be shown the corresponding overwhelming corruption it brings. 
   I feel compelled to respond to earlier discussion on this floor by pointing out that the mere lack of authorization for appropriations, while certainly unfortunate and unsound practice, is not by itself proof positive of corruption. We have not authorized the State Department in years. It is hardly pork barrel spending to fund the Drug Enforcement Agency, another unauthorized agency. 
   Just because large amounts of money flow around elections does not mean that the elections automatically become corrupt. 
   The Supreme Court has said that large gifts directly to a candidate could be corrupting. That is why the hard money limits are in place. I agree with these. 
   If a candidate were to receive a huge--say, in the millions--donation from one donor and could run an entire campaign from it, it would be awfully hard to tell it apart from what is commonly called ``being bought.'' 
   But one donor making even a huge donation to a political party is not buying the party philosophy, they are supporting it. And we cannot tell people how and what to support politically. 
   Many of the proponents of other campaign finance bills try to reduce the influence of ``special interests'' by suppressing their donations and thus their speech. 
   First, I am not even sure suppressing special interests is an admirable goal, since ``special interests'' are citizens expressing a particular viewpoint, such as the Sierra Club, Chambers of Commerce, Common Cause and countless others. 
   That's the point of politics: advocating your goal during the march towards a collective good. There needs to be more interests in politics, not less! 
   I believe the absolute best way to ensure there are no undue special interest influence is to suppress and reduce the size of government. 
   If the government rids itself of special interest funding and corporate subsidies, then there would be less of a perception of any attempts to buy influence through donations. 
   A simplified tax code, state regulation flexibility, local education control--these are less government approaches to problems that would also lower the desperate need for access. 
   Meddlesome outside influences--another horror of campaigning--are a function of the hard money limits, not soft money availability. 
   Candidates lose control of their message when they lose the right to accept money people want to spend and will end up spending on their behalf. 
   The simple fact that large sums of money are spent on elections does not mean those elections are corrupt. 
   In my campaign for Senate, I was outspent by three-quarters of a million dollars. That money obviously did not buy the election. That money did not corrupt the election. 
   Supporters say that the election system is drowning in soft money. 
   They say that soft money has consumed the entire political process. 
   Let me say this. Or, rather, allow me to share what the Supreme Court has to say:  
   The First Amendment denies government the power to determine that spending to promote one's political views is wasteful, excessive, or unwise. In the free society ordained by our Constitution it is not the government but the people--individually as citizens and candidates and collectively as associations and political committees--who must retain control over the quantity and range of debate on public issues in a political campaign.  
   The Supreme Court has been very clear in its rulings concerning campaign finance and the First Amendment. 
   Since the post-Watergate changes to the campaign finance system began, twenty-four Congressional actions have been declared unconstitutional, with nine rejections based on the First Amendment. 
   Out of those nine, four dealt directly with campaign finance reform laws. In each case, the Supreme Court has ruled that political spending--even if obviously excessive--is equal to political speech. 
   Even today, the Supreme Court is addressing a case regarding Missouri contribution limits, showing their continued dedication to protecting the freedom of speech expressed through political support. 
   Besides the constitutional question, there is the simple matter of plain reality. People with money and political views will not give up their desires to express themselves. 
   Like water flowing downhill, politically active Americans who find themselves blocked will just find different outlets to reach their goal. 
   Hard money was regulated, so soft money was invented. If soft money is banned, something else will take its place. 
   The problem is that the regulations and laws that go further and further towards cutting money also go further and further towards unconstitutionality. 
   Some in Congress have stated that freedom of speech and the desire for healthy campaigns in a healthy democracy are in direct conflict, and that we can't have both. 
   The only effective dam, they say, would be to change the First Amendment so as to allow the abridging of political speech. 
   I don't support that belief. Fortunately for those of us who believe in the First Amendment rights of all American citizens, the founding fathers and the Supreme Court do not either. 
   They believe, and I believe, that we can have free political speech and fair campaigns. 
   Also, supporters of some of the campaign finance reform bills believe that if we stop the growth of campaign spending and force give-aways of public and private resources then we will be improving the campaign finance system. 
   The Supreme Court again disagrees and is again very clear in its intent on campaign spending. The Buckley decision says,  
   ..... the mere growth in the cost of federal election campaigns in and of itself provides no basis for governmental restrictions on the quantity of campaign spending.......  
   Campaigns are about ideas and expressing those ideas, no matter how great or small the means. 
   The ``distribution of the humblest handbill'' to the most ``expensive modes of communication'' are both indispensable instruments of effective political speech. We should not force one sector to freely distribute our political ideas just because it is more expensive than all the other sectors. 
   So no matter how objectionable the cost of campaigns, the Supreme Court has stated that this is not reason enough to restrict the speech of candidates or any other groups involved in political speech. 
   Despite my objections to this current legislation, I think I can agree with this bill's cosponsors that improvements can be made to today's system. I have some ideas on that. To that end I have introduced S. 1671, the Campaign Finance Integrity Act of 1999. 
   My bill would: Require candidates to raise at least 50 percent of their contributions from individuals in the state or district in which they are running; equalize contributions from individuals and political action committees (PACs) by raising the individual limit from $1,000 to $2,500 and reducing the PAC limit from $5,000 to $2,500; index individual and PAC contribution limits for inflation; reduce the influence of a candidate's personal wealth by allowing political party committees to match dollar for dollar the personal contribution of a candidate above $5,000; require corporations and labor organizations to seek separate, voluntary authorization of the use of any dues, initiative fees or payment as a condition of employment for political activity, and requires annual full disclosure of those activities  to members and shareholders; prohibit depositing an individual contribution by a campaign unless the individual's profession and employer are reported; encourage the Federal Election Commission to allow filing of reports by computers and other emerging technologies and to make that information accessible to the public on the Internet less than 24 hours of receipt; ban the use of taxpayer financed mass mailings; enhance cuts on the use of federal property for fund raising, restrict use of White House and Air Force One for fund raising, and require non-office holders who use government vehicles for campaigns to reimburse for that usage. 
   This is common sense campaign finance reform. It drives the candidate back into his district or state to raise money from individual contributions. 
   It has some of the most open, full and timely disclosure requirements of any other campaign finance bill in either the Senate or the House of Representatives. I strongly believe that sunshine is the best disinfectant. 
   The right of political parties, groups and individuals to say what they want in a political campaign is preserved but the right of the public to know how much they are spending and what they are saying is also recognized. I have great faith that the public can make its own decisions about campaign discourse if it is given full and timely information. 
   Objecting to the popular quest of the moment is very difficult for any politician, but turning your back on the First Amendment is more difficult for me. 
   I want campaign finance reform but not at the expense of the First Amendment. My legislation does this. 
   As we deal with this issue, I will continue to listen and continue to fine-tune my belief on this matter. But I will not stray from a firm belief in the first amendment, a firm belief in fair campaign laws, and a firm belief that whatever we do here in this body must justly serve the democratic process. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, there are three areas I will respond to, contained in previous comments made on the floor. One has to do with the number of hearings we have had in relation to this issue. Another is what previous Presidents have accepted. Another is our ability to monitor what has happened as far as nuclear testing is concerned. 
   We have had hearings in the Armed Services Committee. I have served on that committee. I have been there personally. I know they have been there. We have had hearings in the Intelligence Committee. To make a statement that this has been brought to the floor without a hearing and discussion in committee is false. We have had those hearings. I believe I have been adequately briefed, as a Member of the Senate, on the pros and cons of moving ahead with the ratification of this particular treaty. 
   As far as previous Presidents pushing for a nuclear test ban, none of the Presidents, except for this President, has worked for zero tolerance. That is unprecedented. Because of that zero tolerance, it creates special problems for this country when it comes to monitoring. We have shown, through our own scientific testing, that it is possible, with low-level nuclear testing, it can be camouflaged. One can let off a low-level test without any kind of detection. When we get to a zero-tolerance level, this all becomes a problem, as far as monitoring. We do have real problems with monitoring. 
   This week we have begun the very important debate regarding the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, better known as the CTBT, and whether its ratification is in the best interest of  the United States. I believe this debate is timely. I have been studying the issue during the course of the last year; attended as many of the hearings as possible; carefully reviewed much of the record; and I listened closely to all my colleagues and the experts with their many varied opinions. After all this, I have come to the conclusion that the CTBT is not in the best interest of this country at this time. 
   As we move into the 21st century, America is confronting new and improved threats. More countries have acquired and are attempting to acquire weapons of mass destruction. This despite all the treaties in place today. Unfortunately, the reality of this threat means that the United States needs not a weakened nuclear deterrent but a stronger and more reliable nuclear deterrent. 
   During the cold war, we were in a bi-polar strategic stance. It was the U.S. versus the Soviet Union. When we signed up to treaties, we were really only negotiating with the USSR. However, with the fall of the USSR, we are in a completely different strategic situation. Our main threats are rogue states whose goals are completely different than the former Soviet Union. I do not believe that these rogue states--Iran, Iraq, North Korea, and the like--really care if we ratify the CTBT. They will do what they believe is in their best interest. 
   For example, what do we do if we ratify the treaty and Iraq conducts a nuclear test? Some would say that we can punish them or shame them. How? Are we going to bomb them? Are we going to place heavy economic sanctions on them? To me, this treaty will do nothing to stop the people we want to stop from testing. While we do not need to go ``mano y mano'' anymore with another state in numbers of warheads, we do need to have a strong nuclear deterrent and to do this we need the technology and industrial base capable of assuring that our weapons stay strong. I believe we use the deterrent approach until we have the technology available to destroy a nuclear threat over the country of origin at which time it becomes a liability to the rogue country. 
   These requirements cannot be confidently met if the United States is obliged to adhere to a zero-yield and permanent CTBT. Despite what we have heard, no other administration has called for this treaty. President Eisenhower proposed a test ban but only for a limited duration. Neither President Kennedy nor President Johnson supported a zero yield test ban. President Nixon agreed to limit test above 150 kilotons and President Carter sought only a ten year ban with tests up to two kilotons. Presidents Reagan and Bush did not pursue a test ban at all. 
   The permanent zero-yield treaty has only been sought by President Clinton. And from my understanding, this has not been the position for the entirety of his administration. As recently as 1995, the Department of Defense position was that it could support a CTBT only if tests of up to 500 tons were permitted. However, the military chiefs were overruled by the civilian leadership after President Clinton agreed to a zero yield test ban. 
   This treaty prohibits all underground nuclear tests, even those so low that they cannot be confidently detected. If this treaty is ratified, we would be permanently prohibited from conducting the sorts of tests we have relied upon in the past to assure the safety, reliability, and effectiveness of our nuclear people. 
   Some of the CTBT proponents believe that the Stockpile Stewardship Program is the antidote to nuclear testing. This program supposes to be able to simulate nuclear explosions through the use of computer modeling. The estimate is that the program will cost at least $4.5 billion a year over 10 years. While Stockpile Stewardship may be the answer in the future, the problem is that with any scientific experiment you must have a comparable element, and in this case a nuclear test. The best way to ensure that the Stockpile Stewardship program is working is to ensure that the results of the model match the results of a test. We must be able to caliberate the model before we should end all testing. I believe this is the height of irresponsibility. 
   With this being said, let me stress one major concern I have about the treaty, and regarding the 6 safeguards proposed by the President. 
   First, as a member of the Intelligence Committee and the Armed Services Committee, I believe the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty submitted to this Senate by President Clinton is not verifiable. This means that, despite the vast array of expensive sensors and detection technology being established under the treaty, it will be possible for other nations to conduct militarily significant nuclear testing with little or no risk of detection. 
   What is militarily significant nuclear testing? The definitions of the term might vary, but I think we'd all agree that any nuclear test that gives a nation information to develop newer, more effective weaponry is military significant. 
   In the case of the United States, nuclear tests will yields between between 1,000 tons and 10,000 tons are generally large enough to provide ``proof'' data on new weapons designs. Other nations might have weaponry that could be assessed at even lower yields. For the sake of argument, however, lets be conservative and assume that other nations would also need to conduct tests at a level above 1,000 tons to develop a new nuclear weapon design. 
   The verification system of the CTBT is supposed to detect nuclear blasts above 1,000 tons, so it would seem at first glance that it will be likely that most cheaters would be caught. We need to look at the fine print, however. In reality, the CTBT system will be able to detect tests of 1,000 tons or more if they were nonevasive and take place at known test sites. This means that the cheater will be caught only if he does not try to hide his nuclear test. But, what if he does want to hide it? What if he conducts his test evasively? 
   From the hearings I have attended, it seems that evasive testing may be a very simple task for Russia, China, or others. One of the best known means of evasion is detonating the nuclear device in a cavity such as a salt dome or a room mined below ground. This technique--called decoupling--reduces the noise, or the seismic signal, of the nuclear detonation. 
   The change in the signal of a decoupled test is so significant--it can be reduced by as much as a factor of 70-- that it will be impossible for any known technology to detect it. For example, a 1,000-ton evasive test would have a signal of a 14-ton nonevasive test. This puts the signal of the illicit test well below the threshold of detection. Decoupling is a well-known technique and is technologically simple to achieve. In fact, it is quite likely that Russia and China have continued to conduct nuclear testing during the past 7 years, while the United States has refrained from doing so. 
   If the CTBT were not going to affect U.S. capabilities, it would not be important whether the treaty were verified or not. The fact is, however, that the CTBT will freeze the U.S. nuclear weapons program and will make it impossible to assess with high confidence whether modifications made to the current stockpile will function as intended. And because there are limits to verifying compliance with the treaty, it will not effectively constrain other nations in the same way. That means they will ultimately be able to gain advantage, at the expense of the United States and our defensive posture. 
   Second, I want to touch on an issue that does not regard the text of the treaty, but the so-called six safeguards. I will not be able to get into detail on all of them, but it seems these safeguards have been discussed as if they were part of the treaty itself. In reality, these safeguards are just promises made by President Clinton. Even if they are contained in the Resolution of Ratification, these safeguards are still subject to congressional and budgetary pressures. 
   For instance, safeguard A states that the Stockpile Stewardship Program must be able to ensure a high level of confidence in the safety and reliability of nuclear weapons in the active stockpile. My concern is, what if the program runs into budgetary programs and a few Congressmen decide we are spending too much money on the program and attempt to kill the program? 
   Also, I know there are special interest groups that support the CTBT but oppose the Stockpile Stewardship Program and will put domestic political pressure on all of us to reduce and end  the Stockpile Stewardship Program and instead fund other programs. 
   Another example of budgetary and political pressures can be associated with a safeguard E. This safeguard insists on the continuing development of a broad range of intelligence gathering and analytical capabilities. This safeguard is already being tested. This administration already attempted to cancel the WC-135 aircraft, citing funding considerations. The WC-135 is essential to U.S. monitoring of nuclear tests. As a member of the Intelligence Committee, I fought for its continued funding. If safeguard E were taken seriously by this administration, they would not be attempting to cancel a program that is essential to monitoring, but would be fully funding these important programs. 
   For these reasons and many others, I must oppose this treaty --not because I want testing, but for the fact that I cannot yet rely upon an untested future program for the safety of our nuclear deterrent. Maybe one day I can support a zero-yield plan. But now is not the time. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. ALLARD. I think that, right now, we have the desire within this Congress to continue to fund the stockpile program. I think many of us believe it is an option. It needs to be scientifically developed. We don't have the science there. I personally have that commitment. I also believe we are developing the technology where we can take our own defense systems--we can take our own rocket and meet it with another rocket that has a nuclear warhead on it, intercept it. Lately, we have begun to demonstrate our ability to do that. 
   I think ultimately we will be able to stop nuclear proliferation when we eliminate the threat of the nuclear warhead going over any other country other than the country from which it was shot. So if we shoot it off over the country from which the missile was launched, then the only hazard is to the country that has the warhead. When we develop that technical capability, then I think we will have a real deterrence. And I don't believe that is far away, by the way.

    Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, the Senate is again considering campaign finance reform. The problem is that almost every Senator has a different definition of--and goal for--reform. Today I am introducing the ``Campaign Finance Integrity Act.'' I believe this bill can actually be agreed upon by a majority of this body that would want to ensure that we improve the campaign finance system (a nearly universally acknowledged goal) without being unconstitutional and attempting measures that fly in the face of the First Amendment. 
   Some in Congress have stated that freedom of speech and the desire for healthy campaigns in a healthy democracy are in direct conflict, and that you can't have both. But fortunately for those of us who believe in the First Amendment rights of all American citizens, the founding fathers and the Supreme Court are on our side. They believe, and I believe, that we can have both. 
   I would hope that celebrating the value of the First Amendment on the floor of the United States Senate is preaching to the choir, as the expression goes, but let me go ahead and do it anyway. Thomas Jefferson repeatedly stated the importance of the First Amendment and how it allows the people and the press the right to speak their minds freely. Jefferson clearly described its significance back in 1798 with, ``One of the amendments to the Constitution.*.*.*.expressly declares that `Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof, or abridging the freedom of speech or of the press,' thereby guarding in the same sentence and under the same words, the freedom of religion, speech, and of the press; insomuch that whatever violates either throws down the sanctuary which covers the others.'' Again in 1808, he stated that ``The liberty of speaking and writing guards our other liberties.'' And in 1823, Jefferson stated, ``The force of public opinion cannot be resisted when permitted freely to be expressed. The agitation it produces must be submitted to.'' Jefferson knew and believed that if we begin restricting what people say, how they say it, and how much they can say, then we deny the first and fundamental freedom given to all Citizens. 
   The Supreme Court has also been very clear in its rulings concerning campaign finance and the First Amendment. Since the post-Watergate changes to the campaign finance system began, 24 Congressional actions have been declared unconstitutional, with 9 rejections based on the First Amendment. Out of those nine, 4 dealt directly with campaign finance reform laws. In each case, the Supreme Court has ruled that political spending is equal to political speech. 
   In the now famous decision, or infamous to some, Buckley vs. Valeo, the Court states that, ``The First Amendment denies government the power to determine that spending to promote one's political views is wasteful, excessive, or unwise. In the free society ordained by our Constitution it is not the government but the people--individually as citizens and candidates and collectively 
   as associations and political committees--who must retain control over the quantity and range of debate on public issues in a political campaign.'' 
   Simply stated, the government cannot ration or regulate political speech of an American through campaign spending limits any more than it can tell the local newspaper how many papers it can print or what it can print. This reinforces Jefferson's statement that to impede one of these rights is to impede all First Amendment rights. 
   Also, supporters of some of the campaign finance reform bills believe that if we stop the growth of campaign spending and force giveaways of public and private resources then all will be fine with the campaign finance system. The Supreme Court agrees and is again very clear in its intent on campaign spending. The Buckley decision says, ``..... the mere growth in the cost of federal election campaigns in and of  itself provides no basis for governmental restrictions on the quantity of campaign spending.......'' 
   Campaigns are about ideas and expressing those ideas, no matter how great or small the means. The ``distribution of the humblest handbill'' to the ``expensive modes of communication'' are both indispensable instruments of effective political speech. We should not force one sector to freely distribute our political ideas just because it is more expensive than all the other sectors. So no matter how objectionable the cost of campaigns are, the Supreme Court has stated that this is not reason enough to restrict the speech of candidates or any other groups involved in political speech. 
   We need a campaign finance bill that does not violate the First Amendment, while providing important provisions to open the campaign finances of candidates up to the scrutiny of the American people. I believe the Campaign Finance Integrity Act does that. 
   My bill would: 
   Require candidates to raise at least 50 percent of their contributions from individuals in the state or district in which they are running. 
   Equalize contributions from individuals and political action committees (PACs) by raising the individual limit from $1000 to $2500 and reducing the PAC limit from $5000 to $2500. 
   Index individual and PAC contribution limits for inflation. 
   Reduce the influence of a candidate's personal wealth by allowing political party committees to match dollar for dollar the personal contribution of a candidate above $5000. 
   Require corporations and labor organizations to seek separate, voluntary authorization of the use of any dues, initiative fees or payment as a condition of employment for political activity, and requires annual full disclosure of those activities to members and shareholders. 
   Prohibit depositing an individual contribution by a campaign unless the individual's profession and employer are reported. 
   Encourage the Federal Election Commission to allow filing of reports by computers and other emerging technologies and to make that information accessible to the public on the Internet less than 24 hours of receipt. 
   Ban the use of taxpayer financed mass mailings. 
   This is common sense campaign finance reform. It drives the candidate back into his district or state to raise money from individual contributions. It has some of the most open, full and timely disclosure requirements of any other campaign finance bill in either the Senate or the House of Representatives. I strongly believe that sunshine is the best disinfectant. 
   The right of political parties, groups and individuals to say what they want in a political campaign is preserved by the right of the public to know how much they are spending and what they are saying is also recognized. I have great faith that the public can make its own decisions about campaign discourse if it is given full and timely information. 
   Many of the proponents of other campaign finance bills try to reduce the influence of interests by suppressing their speech. I believe the best ways to reduce the special interests influence is to suppress and reduce the size of government. If the government rids itself of special interest funding and corporate subsidies, then there would be less reason for influence-buying donations. 
   Objecting to the popular quest of the moment is very difficult for any politician, but turning your back on the First Amendment is more difficult for me. I want campaign finance reform but not at the expense of the First Amendment. My legislation does this. Not everyone will agree with the Campaign Finance Integrity Act, and many of us still disagree on this issue, but the First Amendment is the reason we can disagree and it must be honored here rather than just the Courts.

    Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President. I am honored today to introduce the Residential Solar Energy Tax Credit Act of 1999 which provides a 15 percent residential tax credit for consumers who purchase solar electric (photovoltaics) and solar thermal products. 
   This bill is an important step in preserving U.S. global leadership in the solar industry where we now export over 70 percent of our products. In the last five years, over ten U.S. solar manufacturing facilities have been built or expanded making the U.S. the world's largest manufacturer of solar products. The expansion of the U.S. domestic market is essential to sustain U.S. global market dominance. 
   Other countries, notably Japan and Germany, have instituted very large-scale market incentives for the use of solar energy on buildings--spending far more by their governments to build their respective domestic solar industries. Passage of this bill will insure the U.S. stays the global solar market leader into the next millennium. 
   The recent tax bill passed by this body included necessary support of the independent domestic oil producers, overseas oil refiners, nuclear industry decommissioning, and wind energy--all worthy. This small proposal not only adds to these but provides an incentive to the individual homeowner to generate their own energy. In fact, 28 states have passed laws in the last two years to provide a technical standard for interconnecting solar systems to the electric grid, provide consumer friendly contracts, and provide rates for the excess power generated. These efforts at regulatory reform at the state level combined with a limited incentive as proposed in this bill, will drive the use of solar energy. 
   Contrary to popular belief, solar energy is manufactured and used evenly throughout the United States. Solar manufacturers are in Arizona, California, Colorado, Delaware, Florida, Illinois, Iowa, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Texas, Virginia, Washington and Wisconsin. In addition, solar assembly and distribution companies are in: Alaska, Connecticut, Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho, Indiana, Kansas, Maine, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, Nevada, New Hampshire, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Tennessee, Vermont, as well as Puerto Rico, U.S. Virgin Islands and Guam. In addition to these states, solar component and research companies are in Alabama, Arkansas, Kentucky, Mississippi, Nebraska, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Carolina, and West Virginia. 
   More than 90 U.S. electric utilities, including municipals, cooperatives and independents--which 
   represent more than half of U.S. power generation--are active in solar energy. Aside from new, automated solar manufacturing facilities, a wide range of new uses of solar occurred in 1999, such as: 
   an array of facilities installed in June at the Pentagon power block to provide mid-day peak power; 
   installation of solar on the first U.S. skyscraper in Times Square in New York City; and 
   development of a solar mini-manufacturing facility at a brown field in Chicago which will provide solar products for roadway lighting and for area schools 
   This small sampling of American ingenuity is just the beginning of the U.S. solar industry's maturity. Adoption of solar power by individual American consumers will create economies-of-scale of production that will, over time, dramatically lower costs and increase availability of solar power. 
   The bill I have introduced costs much less than the Administration's proposal and provides consumer safeguards. This bill represents a pragmatic approach in utilizing the marketplace as a driver of technology. The benefits to our country are profound. The U.S. solar industry believes the incentives will create 20,000 new high technology manufacturing jobs, offset pollution of more than 2 million vehicles, cut U.S. solar energy unit imports which are already over 50 percent, and leverage U.S. industry even further into the global export markets. 
   The Residential Solar Energy Tax Credit Act of 1999 is sound energy policy, sound environmental policy, promotes our national security, and enhances our economic strength at home and abroad. I ask my colleagues to include this initiative in upcoming tax deliberations. American consumers will thank us, and our children will thank us for the future benefits we have preserved for them.

   Mr. ALLARD. I thank the chairman for granting me time to make a few comments on the bill. As the relatively new chairman of the Subcommittee on Housing and Transportation of the Banking Committee, I view my relationship with the authorizing committee as a very good relationship, and I know the chairman of the Appropriations Committee has made sure there have been staff at our hearings. I really do appreciate that. I have made a very special effort to make sure I have staff at his hearings, not only his hearings but hearings on the House side. I come to my new responsibilities as chairman of the Subcommittee on HUD to look for change. I think change needs to occur in that agency. I think working together in a bipartisan manner, as well as working between authorization and appropriations, is the way to bring about that change. 
   Mr. President, I thank Senator BOND for giving me the opportunity to make a statement on the VA-HUD Appropriations bill. 
   I appreciate this chance to share my thoughts as chairman of the authorizing subcommittee for the Department of Housing and Urban Development. I look forward to continuing to work with Senator BOND in our joint effort to closely monitor and improve the operations of HUD. 
   This is particularly important when we are dealing with a Federal agency that has repeatedly been designated ``high risk'' by the General Accounting Office. The Department of Housing and Urban Development is the only cabinet level agency that is ``high risk.'' This means that the management deficiencies of the Department pose a significant risk to both taxpayers and the individuals served by HUD programs. 
   The GAO is not alone in its assessment of HUD. The Department's own  inspector general has repeatedly reported on management deficiencies at HUD. There are two positive provisions in this bill concerning the General Accounting Office and the inspector general and I want to commend the chairman for including them. The first requires the GAO to certify quarterly on the cost of time attributable to the failure of HUD to cooperate with any GAO investigation and to reimburse GAO for these costs. 
   The General Accounting Office is the investigative arm of the Congress, and we expect HUD and other agencies to cooperate fully in the investigations that the Congress requests. The second provision is an increase in funding for the Office of Inspector General. The IG is an independent voice within HUD. The present IG is a tremendous watchdog over HUD programs and a valuable resource to the Congress and to the taxpayers. This is clearly an agency that needs a strong and well funded inspector general's office. 
   Let me comment on several other important provisions in the bill. The first terminates a portion of the Community Builders program. In my view, the Community Builders program is a misallocation of the Department's resources. Nearly 10 percent of the Department's personnel are now Community Builders. As best we can tell these positions are largely public relations positions. The Community Builders are among the highest paid employees at HUD, with the program consuming a disproportionate share of travel and training resources. 
   At a time when HUD is considered ``high risk'' the focus should not be on public relations, it should be on ensuring adequate personnel to police HUD programs. As a result of our concerns with the Community Builders program, the Housing Subcommittee will hold an oversight hearing of this program in early October. 
   The hearing will focus on the upcoming inspector general's audit of the program and the views of career HUD employees on the merits of the program. 
   I also want to comment on the section 8 ``opt-out'' issue. This legislation once again grants HUD the authority to renegotiate section 8 contracts and where necessary adjust the contracts up to market rents. This is essentially the same authority given to HUD 2 years ago. Earlier this year, the Housing Subcommittee held a hearing on this very issue. We found that HUD has moved very slowly in utilizing this authority. Hopefully, the language in this bill will once again make clear that HUD has the authority to work with section 8 owners who want to remain in the program and adjust the contracts to the local market rents. 
   Finally, I want to reiterate a point made by the Appropriations Committee in the committee report regarding unauthorized programs. This year HUD requested funding for a number of new programs that have never been authorized by the Congress. The GAO identified 19 new programs with total funding of over $700 million. The administration continues to propose funding for new programs that have little or no relationship to affordable housing. This diverts precious resources from those most in need. If the administration wants new programs, it should make its case before the authorizing committee, not the Appropriations Committee, and I appreciate Senator BOND's recognitiion of this fact. 
   In recent years the Congress has enacted a great deal of housing legislation--including both a major restructuring of public housing and the section 8 program. It has been my view that the Congress should refrain from passing more housing laws until we can determine whether the laws that we have already passed are being properly implemented and whether the Department is being properly managed.

   Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, before I begin my remarks concerning the specifics of the conference report, I want to congratulate Chairman WARNER and Senator LEVIN, for all their hard work on this bill. I believe we have a strong bill which makes dramatic improvements for our military men and women. 
   Also, I want to say that I feel honored to be a part of the Armed Services Committee. It is not too often that a first year member of the committee becomes a Subcommittee Chair. It has been a learning experience but one that I have enjoyed as much as any time during my years in office. 
   We rightly began the year with S.4, the Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen, and Marines Bill of Rights and this has been our guide which brought us to this point. And, I am proud of the many achievements in this conference report. 
   Specifically, the Personnel Subcommittee held four hearings in preparation of this important bill. Through these hearings, we explored recruiting, retention, pay and compensation, military and civilian personnel management and the military health care system. 
   During these hearings, particular emphasis was put on readiness, the retention of highly trained people and the inability of the military services to achieve their recruiting goals. 
   General Shelton and the Service Chiefs urged the President and the Congress to support a military pay raise that would begin to address inequities between military pay and civilian wages, and to resolve the inequity of the ``Redux'' retirement system. 
   This conference report will provide military personnel a four-point-eight percent pay raise on January 1, 2000, and will require that, for the next six years, military pay raises be based on the annual increase in the Employment Cost Index plus one-half a percent. 
   The bill restructures the military pay tables to recognize the value of promotions and to weight the pay raise toward mid-career NCOs and officers where retention is most critical. 
   The Joint Chiefs testified that there is a pay gap between military and private sector wages of 14 percent. This bill moves aggressively to close this gap and ensure military personnel are compensated in an equitable manner. 
   The conference report includes over $250 million specifically to reduce the out-of-pocket housing expense for military personnel and their families. 
   The conference report provides military personnel who entered the service after July 31, 1986 the option to revert to the previous military retirement system that provided at 50 percent multiplier to their base pay averaged over their highest three years and includes full cost-of-living adjustments; or, to accept a $30,000 bonus and remain under the ``Redux'' retirement system. 
   The Joint Chiefs testified that the ``Redux'' retirement system is responsible for an increasing number of mid-career military personnel deciding to leave the service. The conference report will offer these highly trained personnel an attractive incentive to continue to serve a full career. 
   We have authorized a Thrift Savings Plan that will allow service members to save up to five percent of their base pay, before taxes, and will permit them to directly deposit their enlistment and re-enlistment bonuses, up to the limits established by the IRS, into their Thrift Savings Plan. 
   The bill authorizes Service Secretaries to offer to match the Thrift Savings Plan contributions of those service members serving in critical specialities for a period of six years in return for a six year service commitment. This is a powerful tool to assist the services in retaining key personnel in the most critical specialities. 
   In addition to the pay increase, the re-engineering of the military retirement system and the Thrift Savings Plan, we have taken dramatic steps to assist military recruiters and re-enlistment NCOs by authorizing new and increased bonuses and incentives to attract high quality young men and women to join the military services and to stay once they become trained and experienced professionals. 
   We targeted these incentives and bonuses at those critical specialities which the services are having difficulty filling. 
   The Committee has found that the single most frequent reason departing service members cite when asked why they decided to leave the military is excessive time on deployment--too much time away from home and family. 
   We are all well aware that the Clinton administration has deployed military personnel more than at any previous time in our history. 
   The conference report includes a provision that will require 
   the military services to manage the deployment of military personnel within strict time lines. The provision does provide the Secretary of Defense board waiver authority to ensure that military readiness or national security will not be compromised. However, during normal operations, the services will be required to minimize the impact of deployments and track the details that separate a service member from his or her family. This provision will be an important step toward retaining the trained and experienced personnel the services are now losing at an alarming rate. 
   I am sure each Senator has received complaints from constituents regarding the TRICARE health care system. The original Senate bill and the conference report take important steps towards improving the TRICARE health care system of the military services. 
   The conference report directs a totally revamped pharmacy benefit, improves access to care and claims processing, reduces the administrative burden on beneficiaries, enhances the dental benefits, and requires the establishment of a beneficiary advocate to assist service members, retirees and their families who are experiencing difficulty with the TRICARE system. 
   While this conference report has taken a number of important steps toward resolving the most frequent complaints against TRICARE, during the next year the Chairman and I intend to continue to pursue ways to further improve and streamline the military health care system. 
   I have described just a few of the many personnel related provisions in this conference report. As we are all aware, recruiting and retention in the military services is suffering. We simply cannot allow the best military force in the world wither away. 
   As I and other Members of the Senate have visited military bases here in the United States, in Bosnia and in other deployment areas, we have found that our young service men and women are doing a tremendous job, under adverse conditions in many cases. 
   We should move quickly to pass this conference report in order to permit military personnel and their families to make the decision to continue to serve and will assist the military services in recruiting the high quality force we have worked so hard to achieve. 
   There are many other issues outside of the personnel area that I wish I could touch on but there is just not enough time. However, I would like to mention one in particular and that concerns Rocky Flats. 
   The conference Report has four very important provisions which will help ensure that the Rocky Flats Environmental Technology Site will close safely and efficiently by the year 2006. 
   First, the bill authorizes $1.1 billion for all closure projects, with Rocky Flats receiving an extra $15 million above the President's request to help ensure closure by 2006. Second, there is a three year pilot program (FY 2000-2002) authorizing the Secretary of Energy to allocate up to $15 million of prior year unobligated balances in the defense environmental management account for accelerated cleanup at Rocky Flats. This provision could provide $45 million extra for Rocky Flats  through the year 2002. Third, we are requiring the Secretary of Energy to provide a proposed schedule for the shipment of waste from Rocky Flats to the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant in New Mexico, including in the schedule a timetable for obtaining shipping containers. And fourth, the Comptroller General (GAO) must report on the progress of the closure of Rocky Flats by 2006. 
   Again, I want to state that I am proud of this Conference Report and what it provides for our military. 
   In conclusion, I want to recognize and thank the Staff Director of the Personnel Subcommittee Charlie Abell. He is a tremendous asset to me and my staff, the Armed Services Committee, and this Senate. Also, I want to let Senator CLELAND know how much I enjoy having him as my partner and ranking member of the Subcommittee. He is an American hero whose commitment in improving the lives of our military personnel is to be commended. And lastly, I want to thank the Chairman for this time to speak and I want to thank him for his commitment to the bill and to our brave and honorable men and women in uniform. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

    Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I rise today to commend a fellow Coloradan, William M. Houston of Denver, who will be installed as President of the nation's largest insurance association--the Independent Insurance Agents of America (IIAA)--later this month in Las Vegas. Bill is branch manager of Riedman Insurance Corporation, an independent insurance agency located in Denver. 
   Bill began his volunteer service within the insurance industry at the local and state levels. He served on numerous committees of both the Independent Insurance Agents of Denver and the Independent Insurance Agents of Colorado, including serving as president of both organizations. In 1976, Bill was awarded the Local Board President of the Year Award and in 1987 was honored as Colorado Insuror of the year. Bill was elected to IIAA's Executive committee in October 1994 and was honored by his peers when they named him President-Elect of the Association last fall. 
   While on this Association leadership panel; he was worked to strengthen the competitive standing of independent insurance agents by helping to provide the tools they need to run more successful businesses. Over the years, Mr. Houston has been active on several IIAA committees, and has represented the state of Colorado as its representative to IIAA's National Board of State Directors for six years. 
   Aside from his professional volunteer work, Bill also has distinguished himself as an active and concerned member of his community. He is past president of both the Gyro Club and the University Club of Denver, and Trustee (Director) of the National Sports Center for the Disabled in Winter Park, Colorado. 
   Currently, Bill serves on the Board of Directors for the Denver Rotary Club and as an elder in the Wellshire Presbyterian Church. Bill also proudly served his country in the U.S. Marine Corps, initially as a first lieutenant on active duty and as a captain in the Marine Corps Reserves. 
   I am proud of my fellow Coloradan's accomplishments and bid him a successful year as president of the Independent Insurance Agents of America.  As his past accomplishments show, Bill will serve his fellow agents with distinction and strong leadership as he leads IIAA into the new millennium. I wish him and his lovely wife, Jane, all the best as IIAA President and First Lady.

   Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, the Congress has just sent to the President a tax relief package. I believe very strongly that we can do three things: We can cut taxes, we can make substantial strides in paying down the debt, and we can save Social Security. 
   I do not think that asking for a tax cut of between 3 and 3.5 percent of the total anticipated budget spending in the next 10 years is being irresponsible. That is how this administration--the President and the Vice President, AL GORE--would like to characterize it. We have the highest tax burden since World War II. I think this Congress is being responsible to the American people in saying: You deserve some relief, too. 
   I am very disappointed that the President is saying he is going to veto this tax-relief package. I have believed all along that he really does not support any tax cuts. I have believed all  along that he really does not want to pay down the debt and that he really does not care that much about Social Security. I have believed all along that his real agenda is spending. As we move forward this fall with some of the debate, I think it will become more and more clear that the President's agenda is really spending, while the Republicans' agenda in the Congress--and I want to be part of that team--will be to fight to keep taxes down, will be to fight especially hard to pay down the debt, and to save Social Security. 
   I would like to take a moment to make some comments on tax cuts. I believe we took an important step toward addressing our Nation's future by passing the $792 billion tax cut package last month. We passed a bill that pays down the debt, ensures that our obligations to Social Security are met, and provides tax relief for millions of Americans. 
   This tax cut package returns the tax overpayment to those who paid it. I believe this is a far better option than the plans we have seen from the other side of the aisle that would merely spend the extra money. Under our plan, a middle-class family of four will receive over $1,000 a year in tax relief when the plan is fully implemented. 
   In addition to broad-based relief for all taxpayers, the tax bill provides relief in many important areas, including the marriage penalty, the alternative minimum tax, savings and investment, education, health care, the estate tax, and housing. 
   I, for one, believe in the ``opportunity society.'' I believe in success and that people should not be punished when they succeed and prosper. The surplus belongs to those who are succeeding and paying record levels of taxes. When we cut taxes, people are motivated to work harder, and the economy does well. When the economy does well, everyone does well. 
   Some are trying to claim that the Republicans want to return money to the people instead of paying down the debt. Nothing could be further from the truth. In fact, in 2000, the Republican plan, along with a significant tax cut, leaves the public debt $220 billion less than the President's budget proposal. The Republican plan saves 75 percent of the total surplus, as compared to the President's plan which only saves 67 percent of the surplus. 
   I also point out that the Republican plan saves every penny of the Social Security surplus. The President's budget spends $29 billion of the Social Security 
   surplus. 
   These numbers come from the Congressional Budget Office, which Members of Congress can rely on, on a nonpartisan basis, to provide us with accurate figures. 
   Clearly, the recent debate in the Senate was not about debt repayment. The debate was about what to do with the surplus money after addressing debt repayment. I happen to believe we should refund this overpayment to the taxpayers. Some of my colleagues believe we should spend it. I believe the American people are in a better position to know what they need than the Government, particularly the Government here in Washington. I believe we should let the people keep more of their own money to spend on their priorities, not Washington's priorities. I believe the tax package we passed will do just that. 
   By contrast, the President's budget increases taxes--I repeat that, increases taxes--by nearly $100 billion over 10 years. I find it interesting that the President claims we cannot afford $792 billion in tax cuts but believes we can afford $1 trillion in new spending. 
   Although some have tried to portray the tax-relief package as large and irresponsible, I have to disagree. The tax cuts only equal 3.5 percent of what the Congressional Budget Office projects the Federal Government will take in over the next 10 years. In light of the fact Federal tax receipts are already at a record high, I consider this tax cut to be extremely modest. 
   In response to the claim that tax cuts only help the rich, first of all, tax cuts are for taxpayers. If you do not pay taxes, you can't get a tax cut. Under the recently passed tax bill, every American who pays income taxes will get an income tax cut. 
   Our income tax system is progressive. The top 1 percent of earners make 16 percent of the income but pay 32 percent of the income taxes. The top 25 percent of earners pay 81 percent of the income tax, and the top half of earners pay nearly all of the income taxes. 
   Looking more closely at who pays the income taxes, as I noted, the top half of earners pay nearly all of the Federal income taxes. As taxpayers, they will be the ones to receive a tax cut. 
   I would like to examine who those so-called rich are. The rich are 62 percent of all homeowners; 66 percent of those between the ages of 45 and 64; 67 percent of those with a child in the home; 68 percent of those who have attended college, even just one quarter of college; 69 percent of married couples; and 80 percent of two-earner households. 
   I want to comment about the 80 percent of two-earner households. I believe most of those are young Americans who are trying to get started. They are young families, people who have just graduated from college, maybe just come from high school and have the first job. They are trying to buy a house, get a family started, and pay for a very expensive education. In order to do that, both the husband and the wife work. We are taking 80 percent of those two-earner households and we are taxing them at record levels. This particular tax bill is going to help young families getting started, future citizens of this country, the future leaders of this country. 
   I think this is a very good piece of legislation. I remind Senators, again, to remember when they hear our Democrat colleagues talk about the rich who benefit from those tax cuts, this is really who they are talking about. 
   I am pleased this body has taken steps to address tax relief for hard-working Americans. I will continue to support efforts to cut taxes and downsize Government. I believe Congress should reject new taxes and new spending in favor of meaningful tax relief. It is time we return Government money to the rightful owner--the American people. 
   I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.

    Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to recognize the endeavors of two staff members from my D.C. office who have been working especially hard to increase our Republican majority for the future. 
   Three weeks ago, Beth Brown, an employee of mine since I started in the Senate, and her husband Motte, who works for our esteemed President Pro Temp, became the proud parents of Sophie Isabelle Brown. She was born around 11 pm on August 25th at a healthy 7 pound and 2 ounces. This is their first child and my staff and I wish them all the happiness in the world. 
   I am also pleased to announce that just last week John and Eileen Carson brought their second baby girl into their family. Ainsley Jane Adeline Carson arrived September 2nd at 3:09 p.m., weighting 7 pounds and 3 ounces. John is a 5-year member of my staff and my Senior Legislative Assistant. They are doing very well and we extend our warmest wishes and congratulations to them also.

    Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize a program in Colorado aimed at stopping youth violence. In the wake of the shootings at Columbine in Littleton, students and parents throughout northern Colorado in Fort Collins, Greeley, Windsor and my home town of Loveland organized the week of August 29 through September 4 as ``I will pledge week.'' The program was sponsored by the Fort Collins Coloradoan, Clear Channel--the parent company of radio stations KPAW, KCOL, KIIX, and KGLL, and school districts throughout northern Colorado. 
   The ``pledge'' is a symbolic gesture meant to heighten everyone's awareness of the problem of youth violence. It stresses personal responsibility, tolerance and empowers each student to be part of the solution. I have proudly endorsed ``the pledge'' because I believe it will make a difference. I would like to now share with my colleagues ``the pledge.'' 
   The Pledge 
   To end violence ..... ``I will pledge to be a part of the solution. 
   I will eliminate taunting from my behavior. 
   I will encourage others to do the same. 
   I will do my part to make my community a safe place by being more sensitive to others. 
   I will set the example of a caring individual. 
   I will eliminate profanity toward others from my language. 
   I will not let my words or actions hurt others ..... 
   And if others won't become part of the solution, I will.''  
   Last week, literally thousands of students across northern Colorado took this pledge. They committed themselves to be part of the solution to ending youth violence. It is an example I encourage others to follow.

    Mr. Allard. Mr. President, I am pleased to rise today to introduce the Medicare Managed Care Cost Contract Extension Act of 1999. 
   The Medicare Program traditionally offers participating HMOs two contracts to choose from: Medicare risk (Medicare+Choice) and Medicare cost. In an effort to expand and refine the Medicare+Choice program, Section 4002 of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 terminates the Medicare cost contract program effective December 31, 2002. This termination of cost contracts will leave two options for a Medicare recipient, that of traditional Medicare fee-for-service and Medicare+Choice. 
   As of June of this year 358,658 Americans receive Medicare HMO service through Medicare cost contracts. The vast majority of these Americans live in rural areas where there are no Medicare+Choice options. In my house state of Colorado, 97 percent of Medicare cost contracting beneficiaries live in a county that does not currently have another Medicare HMO option. If the intention of the Balanced Budget Act and Medicare+Choice is to provide a standard, reliable option to Medicare fee-for-service coverage it has not yet accomplished this in rural areas. It appears to me that until Medicare+Choice coverage is available to rural cost contract recipients Congress should re-consider this sunset. 
   While I agree with the wisdom of the Balanced Budget Act, we have discovered a number of areas where the Act has not produced the results that Congress intended. As well meaning as the sunset provision for cost contracts may have been, I am confident that Congress has no intention of leaving rural Americans without a choice in their Medicare coverage. 
   The legislation I am introducing will postpone the sunset date by three years to December 31, 2005. I believe that this extension accomplishes a  number of things consistent with the Balanced Budget Act as it concerns cost contracting. 
   The Medicare Managed Care Cost Contract Extension Act of 1999 will not change current requirement that the Health Care Financing Administration produce a study on the impact of cost contracting termination. This study is currently due in January 2001. I think it is important that this report be delivered to Congress while there is still time to establish a permanent extension or another sensible solution that will maintain choice for Medicare recipients. 
   As we have seen in my home state of Colorado, Medicare+Choice options have not developed in rural areas currently served by Medicare cost contractors. The Balanced Budget Act may have intended to replace cost contracting services with Medicare+Choice options, but these options are not yet available. I believe it would be irresponsible to continue to move cost contract beneficiaries toward an option that is unavailable. If Medicare+Choice can effectively serve rural areas they should have time to establish themselves. Based on current trends in rural health care I do not believe that Medicare+Choice will be a viable option in 2002, and perhaps not any time in the foreseeable future. 
   I believe that Medicare beneficiaries deserve a choice in how they receive their health care, and for a few people in our nation the only nation to Medicare fee-for-service is through a cost contract. I hope that as we consider various proposals for Medicare reform that we will consider the 358,658 Americans who are facing the elimination of the Medicare option they chose to provide their health care.

    Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, the federal budget is prominent right now as we discuss the spending policies that will guide Congress through the coming fiscal years. In the midst of these discussions, I would like to bring up an important issue that many members have supported in the past. I am here today to introduce a line-item veto constitutional amendment. 
   Prior to my election to the Senate I served in the House of Representatives. In that body I introduced a constitutional line-item veto on several occasions. This was motivated by my view that the greatest threat to our economy was deficit spending which is still adding to the accumulated $5.6 trillion national debt. As a Member of the Senate, I introduced this legislation again in 1997. This occurred just after a Federal district court declared the enacted statutory line-item veto, or more accurately, enhanced rescission authority, to be unconstitutional. 
   In 1996, Congress gave the President what is generally referred to as expanded rescission authority when it passed the Line Item Veto Act. All Presidents, beginning with George Washington, had impoundment authority similar to what the Line Item Veto Act intended until Congress limited rescission authority in 1974 under the Impoundment Control Act. 
   Ultimately the Supreme Court upheld the district court ruling in Clinton v. City of New York, where the Line Item Veto Act was ruled unconstitutional on grounds that it violates the presentment clause. Now a presidential line-item veto can only be provided by amending the Constitution, and that is what I seek to do with this legislation. 
   Governors in 43 states have some type of line item veto. This is consistent with the approach taken in most state constitutions of providing a greater level of detail concerning the budget process than is contained in the U.S. Constitution. In my view, the line item veto has been an important factor in the more responsible budgeting that occurs at the state level. 
   Colorado gives line item veto authority to the governor, and that power, along with a balanced budget requirement in the state constitution, has worked well and insured that Colorado has been governed in a fiscally responsible manner regardless of who served in the legislature or in the governor's office. 
   I believe it is time that we take the approach of the states. In order to do this we must enact a Constitutional Amendment. Under article I, section 7 of the Constitution, the President's veto authority has been interpreted to mean that he must sign or veto an entire piece of legislation. 
   The Constitution reads: ``Every Bill which shall have passed the House of Representatives and the Senate, shall, before it becomes a Law, be presented to the President of the United States; If he approve he shall sign it, but if not he shall return it, with his Objections to that House in which it shall have originated, * * *'' this section then proceeds to outline the procedures by which Congress may override this veto with a two-thirds vote of both houses. 
   The amendment that I am introducing today amends this language as it pertains to appropriations bills. It specifically provides that the President shall have the power to disapprove any appropriation of an appropriations bill at the time the President approves the bill. 
   This change will make explicit that the President is no longer confined to  either vetoing or signing an entire bill, but that he may choose to single out certain appropriations for veto and still sign a portion of the bill. 
   A constitutional amendment ensuring that the President has line-item veto authority over congressional spending bills is an important tool in our continuing efforts to restore fiscal responsibility to the Federal government. 
   Mr. President, I look forward to further discussion on this important issue. We must seriously consider a constitutional amendment to allow the line item veto, and I hope that my colleagues will support this amendment or similar language in the Senate.

   Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, this amendment would expand the small business provisions of this tax bill. I am pleased that several of the provisions have been accepted. We are making solid progress on this issue. 
   This is a bipartisan amendment, cosponsored by Senators ROBB of Virginia and HAGEL of Nebraska. 
   I support tax relief for the American people, and I will support this tax bill. The surplus belongs to the American people, and I think a refund of one-third of the surplus is reasonable. 
   While I support the bill, I have been working to improve it before final passage. 
   In particular, we should expand the small business tax section of the code known as Subchapter S. Subchapter S of the Internal Revenue Code was enacted by Congress in 1958 and has been liberalized a number of times over the last two decades, significantly in 1982 and again in 1996. 
   This reflects a desire on the part of Congress to reduce taxes on small businesses. Subchapter S eliminates the double taxation of small business income. 
   Under Subchapter S the business is taxed at the shareholder level alone, it is not taxed at the corporate level. Subchapter S is available only to small businesses that have a small number of shareholders. 
   Congress made small banks eligible for S corporation status in the 1996 ``Small Business Job Protection Act.'' 
   Since first becoming eligible, nearly 1,000 small banks have converted from regular corporations to small business corporations. 
   Unfortunately, many more would like to convert, but are prevented from doing so by a number of remaining obstacles in the tax law. 
   My amendment builds on and clarifies the Subchapter S provisions from 1996. It contains several provisions of particular benefit to community banks that may be contemplating a conversion to Subchapter S. 
   The amendment is based on S. 875, legislation that I introduced earlier this year with the cosponsorship of Senators GRAMM, BENNETT, SHELBY, ABRAHAM, HAGEL, ENZI, MACK, GRAMS, INHOFE, BROWNBACK, and THOMAS. 
   I have selected several provisions from the bill for this amendment and the Finance Committee has agreed to accept them. Let me review these provisions: 
   First, we exclude investment securities income from the passive income test for banks. Banks are unique, they are required to hold passive investments such as federal bonds and municipal bonds in order to comply with safety and soundness regulations. 
   This provision is only fair. If we require certain investments by regulation, we should not use this requirement to prohibit banks from becoming Subchapter S small businesses. 
   Second, we permit Subchapter S small business corporations to have bank director stock. Again, regulations require banks to have bank director stock. 
   We clarify that this does not punish banks. They can still become small business corporations. 
   In addition, I will be working with Chairman ROTH and his staff on several other provisions to consider for the future. These include one to permit Individual Retirement Accounts to be shareholders in an S corporation. This provision is a recognition of the importance of IRAs. 
   We have found that many community bank owners have their shares in an IRA. There is nothing wrong with this. We should let them be shareholders. 
   In addition, we hope in the future to permit S corporations to issue preferred stock. This would give all small businesses that are S corporations access to investment capital. 
   Let me conclude with a general statement on why we should enact these changes. Last year we enacted broad legislation to support credit unions. I supported this legislation. 
   We should now give small banks some tax relief. They are in a tough competitive position. 
   We are about to approve financial modernization in this Congress. I am a member of the Conference on this important legislation. I support the legislation. 
   But I think it is right to note that this legislation is of greatest appeal to larger financial institutions. 
   Again, our small community banks need help. They need tax relief to help them compete and survive. This amendment give the small banks tax relief. 
   This amendment is supported by the Independent Community Bankers of America, the American Bankers Association, the Independent Bankers of Colorado, the Colorado Bankers Association, the Independent Bankers Association of Texas, and others. 
   I am pleased that the Finance Committee has accepted the passive income and director stock provisions of the amendment. 
   In addition, Senator ROTH  and his staff have agreed to work with us on the remaining provisions of the amendment and S. 875.

   Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I would like to make some comments regarding repeal of the ``temporary'' 0.2 percent Federal unemployment tax (FUTA) surtax. 
   Earlier this year I introduced S. 103 to repeal the surtax. 
   I commend Chairman ROTH and my colleagues on the Finance Committee for including in their tax bill repeal of the temporary 0.2 percent FUTA surtax. 
   I would, however, like to accelerate the effective date from 2004 to next year. 
   I believe that this tax relief provision is very important for both businesses and employees. We should repeal the surtax immediately. 
   The ``temporary'' surtax was enacted in 1976 by Congress to repay the general fund of the Treasury for funds borrowed by the unemployment trust fund. 
   Although the borrowings were repaid in 1987, Congress has continued to extend the surtax in tax bill after tax bill. 
   Since 1987, Congress has used extension of the surtax to help raise revenue to pay for tax packages. 
   In fact, the surtax was most recently extended to help pay for the 1997 tax bill. 
   The tax takes money out of the private economy for no valid reason. 
   By repealing the surtax, Congress will honor a promise that it made when the surtax was first enacted. 
   Small businesses were told repeatedly that the tax was temporary and would be repealed when it was no longer needed to finance the unemployment tax system. 
   Clearly a tax is not temporary when it has already been in place for over twenty years. 
   Based on the original purpose, the surtax is no longer needed. 
   The economy is experiencing the highest level of employment in decades, and all state unemployment funds have surpluses. 
   It is inappropriate for the government to continue to raise excess unemployment taxes and then use the surplus for purposes completely unrelated to unemployment. 
   Repeal of the temporary unemployment surtax will also be beneficial to small businesses. 
   The surtax is especially hard on the small businesses because they are often labor intensive. 
   Any payroll tax is added directly to the employer's payroll costs. 
   In fact, according to the National Federation of Independent Business, payroll taxes are the fastest growing federal tax burden on small business. 
   It is also important to note that the payroll taxes must be paid whether the business experiences a profit or a loss. 
   As a former small businessman myself, I am particularly aware of this fact. 
   I suspect that my view is similar to the view of many other small business owners. 
   It is one thing to have a surtax when unemployment is high and the surtax is necessary. 
   However, it is totally unjustified when unemployment is at the lowest level in three decades. 
   Repeal of the 0.2 percent surtax will reduce the tax burden on employers and workers by $6 billion over the next five years. 
   Lower payroll taxes mean higher wages for workers. 
   Although the employer appears to fully pay the unemployment surtax and other payroll taxes, the economic evidence is strong that the cost is actually passed along to workers in the form of lower wages. 
   Consistent tax relief will help to ensure that our economy remains the strongest and most vibrant in the world. 
   Low taxes reduce unemployment and help ensure that future surtaxes are unnecessary. 
   The time has come to do away with this outdated and unnecessary surtax. 
   Again, I commend the Finance Committee for their provision to repeal the FUTA surtax, and I urge my colleagues to support efforts to accelerate the effective date so that repeal is immediate.

   Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Texas for her remarks, and I also thank the two Senators from Wyoming for their remarks this morning regarding tax cuts. 
   Our economy has been doing well. It is an unprecedented time of economic growth. Whenever our economy does well, everybody does well. People who are poor do well. You can break it out to any type of economic group you want, but everybody does well because the total tide comes up. 
   I happen to believe our economy is doing well because we have worked hard in the last decade, decade and a half, to hold down taxes, to reduce the regulatory burden, and to promote good economic growth. 
   The last effort by the Republicans in the Congress to make sure we continue to have good, strong economic growth in this country was when we dropped the capital gains rate. Nobody is talking about the profound impact that reducing the capital gains rate has had on this country's economic growth. Historically, every time we have dropped capital gains, whether it was during the Kennedy administration or whether it was during the Reagan administration--in some cases, I have seen that happen in my own State of Colorado--revenues to the Federal Government increase. 
   Today tax revenues to the Federal Government are at a historic high. There is a windfall. There is more money coming into the Federal Government than any of us would have imagined. I think we need to give back some change to the American people. It is their money. They worked hard to earn the money. Consequently, I think they should be the primary recipient of a windfall. 
   The people of Colorado were blessed because a Republican legislature, with a Republican Governor, returned dollars that came in unexpectedly as revenues to the State of Colorado. They returned it to the taxpayers of Colorado, the people who earn the money, who pay taxes. I happen to think my State of Colorado, under their leadership, has set a great example for the country. I certainly hope this Congress will move forward with a meaningful tax break that will make a difference in people's lives. 
   We hear a lot of figures thrown around here on the floor. We just heard an example of some of the numbers that had been thrown around this morning and then this afternoon about what is happening to our budget. 
   We have figures that have come out of OMB. We have figures that have come out of CBO. Let's just take one agency so we are comparing apples with apples and oranges with oranges. I don't think it is fair to pick some of the figures out of OMB and then some of the figures out of CBO and make comparisons. We need to go with one agency. 
   Let's make a comparison between what the President has done with his plan and the Democrat Party, and what the Republican leadership is pushing for. Let's take the figures from the Congressional Budget Office and see what they look like, comparing the President's budget with what the Republicans are putting together and what they would like to see happen for the future of America. 
   The President's budget, as reported in the latest report issued by CBO, on July 21, 1999, would leave a public debt of $1.80 trillion in 2009. When you compare that to the Republican proposal, it is over $200 billion higher than the amount left under the congressional budget resolution and the tax cut. 
   Let's look at the President's budget in terms of the total surplus under CBO's scoring. CBO says the President's budget saves just 67 percent of the total surplus. Now, that compares to a 75-percent saving of the total surplus by the congressional budget resolution and tax cut on the Republican side. President Clinton's budget contains $1 trillion in new spending. I think this issue is really more about spending than about taxes. The President wants to have the money so he can continue to spend more and more. We have heard from the big spenders. They would much rather increase spending than cut taxes. I think we ought to cut taxes instead of increasing spending. 
   President Clinton's budget, again, contains $1 trillion in new spending. That is 25 percent larger than the Republicans' $792 billion reconciliation tax cut. President Clinton's budget increases taxes by $100 billion over the next 10 years, according to the CBO report, in contrast to the largest middle-class tax cut since Ronald Reagan that is being offered by the Republicans. President Clinton's budget spends the Social Security surplus, the off-budget surplus, for fiscal years 2000, 2004, and 2005 by a total of $29 billion. Now, that is in contrast to the congressional budget resolution and tax cut where the Social Security trust fund is not raided at all in any year. 
   Even Democrats don't agree necessarily with their own President on his obsessive stand against tax cuts. I can think of one problem to which a Democrat, a friend of mine with whom I serve on the Intelligence Committee, who also happens to be on the Finance Committee, refers. He says: ``To me, cutting taxes when we have $3 trillion more coming in than we forecast in the neighborhood''--he is talking about his $800 billion tax proposal--``is hardly what I call an outrageous, irresponsible move.'' 
   Some of the Members of the Senate on the other side who have been talking this morning are talking about more spending as opposed to wanting to cut taxes. They say they are willing to run on that agenda. I am willing to take our agenda as Republicans and put it up against what the President is proposing in his plan for the American people. This Republican Congress, I  think, has the right message and has the right approach for protecting the future of America. 
   I think this is great. I am willing to brag about the fact that we protect every cent of Social Security's $1.9 trillion surplus in every year, which adheres to the spending agreement reached with the President in 1997. It also leaves $277 billion to finance emergencies and other priorities, like Medicare and prescription drugs, or simply additional debt reduction, yet still proposes returning $792 billion of the $1 trillion personal income tax overpayment to the taxpayers--I will run on that. I would be glad to run against any Democrat who would come up and say that he supports the President's plan which proposes to increase taxes by $100 billion over the next 10 years, a plan that, despite the largest Federal budget surplus in history, wants to increase taxes, wants $1.1 trillion more spending than a Congress which is adhering to the 1997 budget agreement, which raids Social Security for $30 billion over the next 10 years, which retires over $200 billion less in public debt than the Congress, and which would still not provide a single cent in net tax relief, despite a $1 trillion personal income tax overpayment. 
   I would be glad to run on that. It amazes me that as we get closer to the election, more and more of the debate gets to be toward cutting taxes. But when we are out from the election, then people criticize Republicans. Other Members in this body, on the other side, criticize Republicans for trying to do the responsible thing and recognize that the windfall that is coming into the Federal Government, the windfall that is coming into the States, actually belongs to the people. They are the ones who worked hard and the ones who earned it. 
   I want to come down on the side of many of my colleagues on 
   the Republican side who have argued for a tax cut. I think we can do that and pay down the debt. As Senator ENZI mentioned in his comments earlier this morning, we can do both. We can pay down the debt. We can provide for a tax cut, and that is the responsible thing to do. To say that the responsible thing to do is more spending, I believe, is irresponsible. 
   I want to let it be known that I am strongly in favor of a tax cut, and I am strongly in favor of paying down the debt. I believe we can do both. 
   I yield the floor.

    Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize and honor the 50th anniversary of Colorado Chapter 26 of the Disabled American Veterans. 
   July 26, 1999 is the anniversary of this distinguished group. Chapter 26 consists of over 2,000 veterans, making it the largest chapter in Colorado. Not only did these men and women serve their country in a time of war, but they came home and continued to demonstrate their respect for America. Colorado Springs, El Paso County, and the State of Colorado have seen and felt their numerous contributions first hand in these times of peace--a peace which they helped to provide. 
   The Veterans of Chapter 26 have never forgotten their duty to serve and defend, whether it be overseas or at home. Their un-relinquishing duty to America should be recognized. 
   Reaching fifty years of service and dedication is a milestone in the lives of these men and women who served in the Armed Forces of the United States of America and became members of Chapter 26. These members offered their lives to protect our country. They survived the perils of war, not unscathed, to come home and continue to serve as outstanding citizens. They have shown a love that has been unwavering for fifty years towards this country that they sacrificed so much to preserve. They are models of patriotism, citizenship, and dedication to the freedoms cherished in these United States. And they continue to serve America with all of the pride and honor that they showed fifty years ago when they sacrificed their time and bodies for the freedom of others. 
   So on July 26th 1999 the Colorado Chapter 26 of the United States Disabled American Veterans should be recognized and honored for the fifty years of unwavering pride and service--the ideals which America was built upon.

   Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the Intelligence Authorization Act. 
   While we cannot discuss the details of the bill, I can say that as a member of the Intelligence Committee, we have provided the necessary funds to the intelligence community to do their job. 
   One matter of controversy for some is the Kyl-Domenici-Murkowski DOE reorganization amendment. I strongly support this amendment. 
   In the last year, the Cox report has shown us why we need to improve the security structure at DOE, and the President's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board, headed by Senator RUDMAN, shows us the way. The Kyl amendment before us is nearly identical to the President's own Advisory Board recommendation. 
   The President's Advisory Board report states that the problems at DOE are worse than most people could have ever imagined. Quoting from the report:  
   In response to these problems, the Department has been the subject of a nearly unbroken history of dire warnings and attempted but aborted reforms.......sSecond only to its world-class intellectual feats has been its ability to fend off systematic change.  
   I know that Secretary Richardson has put forward a reorganization plan, and I commend him for taking the initiative. I have known him for some time and I know he is doing what he believes is right for the Department. However, my concern is that he will not be the Secretary forever, and I am worried that the Department's ``ability to fend off systematic change'' will prevail once he leaves. 
   The only way to fix the security problems are to make radical changes at the Department, as recommended in the DOE study headed by then chairman of Motorola, Bob Galvin. 
   The amendment before us is not the most ``radical'' idea which could have been presented. In many ways, I believe that a separate agency for the nuclear programs could be the best way to enhance security, but I am a realist and know that if the amendment before us causes such heartache, I can only imagine the reaction to a separate agency amendment. 
   Basically, the Kyl-Domenici-Murkowski amendment would establish a separate entity, the Agency for Nuclear Stewardship, within the Department of Energy. The Agency will have clear lines of authority, accountability, and an independent budget. The new Agency will be headed by an Under Secretary of Nuclear Stewardship who reports directly to the Secretary. The Directors of the 3 national labs and the nuclear labs will report to the Under Secretary. 
   First, I understand the amendment creates a ``security czar,'' for the lack of a better term, who will be in charge of security for all the nuclear lab programs under the Under Secretary. While I understand why this position would be placed under the Under Secretary, I also understand how bureaucracies work and the perception they hold for their hierarchy of authority. That is why I believe the security czar position should be placed directly under the Secretary, if for no other reason than to show that he is in charge and will be held accountable. However, I have also heard the concern that if this person is placed under the Secretary then his attention may be diverted to the other matters outside of the nuclear programs. For this reason, I hope that it will be understood that the security czar has the authority, both real and perceived, and will be solely focused on the real security concerns of the nuclear programs but also with the flexibility to not be tied to nonnuclear concerns. 
   Second, Secretary Richardson believes that this amendment would only divide the Department into more fiefdoms. I do not agree with this assessment. We must break the nuclear stewardship programs out of the main programs of DOE. This new Agency for Nuclear Stewardship is too important and sensitive to treat it like the power marketing administrations, fossil energy, or any other area of the Department. The reports from the last year show that we need to break the nuclear programs out and the approach in this amendment will raise the stature of the programs and will improve the security for our nation. 
   Let me end by stating that after five internal DOE reviews, four outside studies, six GAO reports, and three blue ribbon commissions, it is time to make these much needed changes at the Department. I ask that all my colleagues support the Kyl-Domenici-Murkowski amendment and the Intelligence Authorization Act. 
   I yield back the remainder of my time. I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Georgia, Mr. COVERDELL, for leading the discussion this morning on the need to have tax cuts for all Americans. I agree with my colleague from Missouri, Senator ASHCROFT, and his call to action. He said: Americans have earned it; Uncle Sam ought to return it. 
   I agree with my colleague from Idaho, Senator CRAIG, who pointed out that right now Americans are facing the highest tax burden since World War II. I also would like to associate myself with the comments of my colleague from Minnesota, Senator GRAMS, who says we can save Social Security, we can pay down the public debt, and we can still provide tax cuts for Americans. My colleague from Kansas, Senator BROWNBACK, will probably talk about the need of cutting taxes for the benefit of American families.  
   These are all very good points on why we should cut taxes. In talking with my constituents in town meetings across Colorado, one thing I hear in every meeting is that Congress should cut taxes. The legislature in the State of Colorado, and the Republican Governor in the State of Colorado, have heard the same message. This year there were some major tax cut provisions for the people of Colorado. The Governor of Colorado, Governor Owens, has pointed out that he plans on making another major tax cut for the people of Colorado next year. They recognize that government is receiving a windfall with our good economy, and we ought to cut taxes to give people the power to determine how they want to spend that money. 
   The government in Colorado or the Government in Washington should not be spending those dollars. The power really does belong with the people, not with the government in Colorado or, particularly, with the Government in Washington, DC. 
   People of all ages, professions, and positions in life believe they send too much of their paycheck to Washington. I happen to agree with that. Taxes are currently at a record high level. According to the Tax Foundation, Tax Freedom Day, the day in the year to which the typical American family must work to pay their combined Federal, State, and local taxes, was May 11 this year. This is the latest day ever, but it is hardly surprising in light of the fact that the combined effective tax rate is also the highest ever. When you add in the cost of Government regulations, Americans did not finish paying for the cost of Government until June 22nd. I believe Congress should downsize Government and return power to the States, localities, and individuals. 
   Part of the effort to downsize Government must also include a tax cut. I believe Americans should be able to keep more of their own money. American workers already pay 38 percent of their income in taxes, which is more than they spend on food, clothing, and housing combined. For the average family, this translates to a large percentage of their paycheck going straight to Uncle Sam. 
   A tax cut means they could keep more of their money to use for their priorities, not Washington's priorities. Some families may choose to use that money for a downpayment on a house, others, for education, and other families will now have the money to work fewer hours and spend more time together. The important point is, they know their own family needs and we, in Washington, do not. 
   I realize some question the wisdom of tax cuts. We always hear from those, sometimes I think louder than we do from others, except when it comes to election time, and then their voice is heard. They believe the budget cannot be balanced or Social Security cannot be saved if they return taxpayer money. However, according to a recent Congressional Research Service study, there will be an additional $800 billion on budget surplus over the next 10 years, even after assuring that all our obligations to Social Security and Medicare have been met. 
   The study also found the average household will pay $5,000 more in taxes than the Government needs to operate over the next 10 years. This money belongs to the American people. We must refund the excess in the form of tax cuts and not spend it. At the very least, we should reduce the excessive recent growth of the Federal tax burden. 
   During the Clinton administration, Federal tax receipts have increased by over 54 percent. Tax revenues have grown twice as fast as our economy and twice as fast as economic growth for working Americans. Clinton tax hikes have left each American $4,000 per year poorer, yet the President is not done. His budget for Fiscal Year 2000 proposes $96 billion in new taxes. Congress should reject new taxes and new spending in favor of meaningful tax relief. 
   In conclusion, I point out that it is time we return Government money to its rightful owner, and that is the American people. 
   I thank the Senator from Georgia for allowing me to join with him and my other colleagues in the Senate to deliver this very important message.

   Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, over the course of the last week the Senate has examined at great length many of health care's problems in America. On the floor we have discussed various legitimate problems and anecdotal horror stories to such an extent that I fear we may have obscured what is positive about health care in the United States. 
   Each year US News and World Report magazine recognizes American hospitals that practice health care that all Americans can be proud. These hospitals perform at the very highest levels, demonstrating excellence in general care and specific areas of medical specialty. This year the magazine analyzed each of our nation's 6,299 hospitals, and I am proud to rise today to recognize a number of hospitals from my home state of Colorado that have been recognized by US News and World Report for their outstanding work. 
   In Colorado we have long understood the value these fine institutions bring to their communities, our state, and the Rocky Mountain region. 
   I would like to recognize Children's Hospital in Denver, ranked 12th nationally in the specialty of Pediatrics, and 2nd in the Western Region. 
   I would like to recognize Craig Hospital in Denver, ranked 5th nationally in the specialty of Rehabilitation, and 2nd in the Western Region. 
   I would like to recognize University Hospital in Denver, ranked 37th nationally in the specialty of Ear Nose and Throat, 4th in the Western Region; ranked 23rd nationally in the specialty of Rheumatology, 4th in the Western Region; and ranked 15th nationally in the specialty of Rehabilitation, and 4th in the Western Region. 
   Finally, I would like to salute National Jewish in Denver, for their overall number one ranking as the finest American hospital for Respiratory Disorders. 
   I know I speak for all Coloradoans when I say that I am thankful to have these fine institutions in our state. 
   I congratulate Children's Hospital, University Hospital, Craig Hospital and National Jewish for this recognition of their exemplary work.

   Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, in the 1970s, the State of Colorado adopted a well-child care law, legislation concerning the treatment of alcoholism and mental health, as well as legislation concerning insurance coverage of psychologists. In the 1980s home health care, hospice care, and mammography screening legislation was passed into law. In the 1990s, those who represent the people of Colorado in the State House saw fit to pass laws concerning the coverage of nurses, nurse midwives, nurse anesthetists, nurse practitioners, psychiatric nurses, the continuation of coverage for dependents and employees, and conversion to non-group health care. 
   This decade the Colorado Legislature also passed consumer grievance procedures, children's dental anesthesia and general dental provisions, direct access to OB-GYN, direct access to midwives for OB-GYN, emergency room services legislation, a ban on gag clauses, prostate cancer screening, breast reconstruction, maternity stay, and mental health parity legislation. Last, but certainly not least, among State laws enacted in my home State is a law concerning independent external appeals  for patients and a comprehensive Patients' Bill of Rights, passed in 1997. 
   I am proud to have served in the Colorado State Senate, and I am proud to say that today I represent a state that has been responsive and aggressive in addressing health care issues and patients' rights. 
   At the same time, Mr. President, I am deeply troubled that there are those in this body who are advocates of Senator KENNEDY's Patients' Bill of Rights that would preempt a number of the laws that I just mentioned in the State of Colorado. In this country of 260 million Americans throughout the fifty states I believe that the people of those States are in the best position to make these specific decisions. I come from our nation's 8th largest State with a population of just 3.9 million people. I will not assume that any federal entity is more prepared to develop policy for Colorado than the people of Colorado, nor would I impose the policies unique to Colorado's needs on another State. 
   Something I find equally troubling is that in addition to infringing on the laws of the State of Colorado, the legislation that Senator KENNEDY and the Democrats have developed has the potential to increase health care costs, deprive 1.9 million Americans of health insurance who are currently covered, and cast heavy mandates down on individual states who are in a far better position to make these decisions for themselves. 
   I will speak today about a number of things I believe will enhance the quality of health care, increase access to care, and provide important protections for patients without unnecessarily placing mandates on individual states. These provisions are all part of a comprehensive package called the Patients' Bill of Rights Plus Act, which I feel properly addresses the needs of America's patients, physicians and health care providers. 
   The Patients' Bill of Rights Plus Act establishes consumer protection standards for self-funded plans currently governed by the Employee Retirement and Income Security Act (ERISA). 48 million Americans are currently covered by plans governed by ERISA--these are American health care consumers who are not under the jurisdiction of state laws. 
   Our bill would eliminate gag rule clauses in providers' contracts and ensure that patients have access to specialty care. The legislation also requires that health plans that use formularies to provide prescription medications ensure the participation of doctors and pharmacists in the construction of the formulary. Further addressing patient choice and access, health plans would be required to allow women direct access to obstetricians and gynecologists, and direct access to pediatricians for children, without referrals from general practitioners. 
   These provisions are important steps in removing barriers that may prevent patients covered under ERISA from receiving necessary and proper treatment in a timely manner. 
   As a former small business owner I have a keen understanding of the issues that confront the self-employed. I also have experience in balancing the wages and benefits you extend to an employee with a healthy bottom line. I think it is important that we remember throughout the course of this debate that employers provide health care benefits as a voluntary form of compensation for their employees. We must be wary of legislation that will increase costs and liability for employers in a way that may reduce the quality and scope of benefit packages for employees. 
   Our bill, the Patients' Bill of Rights Plus, would make health insurance deductible for the self-employed and increase the availability of medical savings accounts. I believe that each of these provisions would give greater power to the individual and make private insurance more affordable for families and individuals. Large corporations can claim a 100 percent deduction for health care and small business should be treated the same. 
   Medical savings accounts, otherwise known as MSAs, combine a high deductible and low cost catastrophic policy with tax free savings that can be used for routine medical expenses. We should increase the availability to all families who desire MSAs. These efforts will prove particularly helpful to those individuals working for small business, and those in transition from one job to another since MSAs are fully portable. 
   I want to stress that our legislation will not mandate these accounts for everyone, but will simply establish the accounts as an option to those who feel they will be best served by MSAs. I believe that medical savings accounts are particularly important for uninsured, lower income Americans. Allowing consumers to pay for medical expenses through these affordable tax-deductible plans, tailored to their needs, is a viable free-market approach to decreasing the number of uninsured in America. This is a question of providing greater choice for health care consumers. 
   The Patients' Bill of Rights Plus Act would also permit the carryover of unused benefits from flexible spending accounts, again increasing the number of options available to the consumers of health care. 
   In keeping with presenting more options to the consumer, The Patients' Bill of Rights Plus Act includes language that would require all group health plans to provide a wide range of comparative information about the health coverage they provide. This information would include descriptions of health insurance coverage and the networks who provide care so that consumers covered by self insured and fully insured group health plans can make the best decisions based on their needs and preferences. 
   One of the most contentious issues in health care has been the issue of malpractice liability, grievance procedures and the mechanism for the appeal of decisions made by managed care companies. My colleagues across the aisle are interested in taking the grievance procedure into a court of law, allowing a patient greater access to litigation as a means of challenging a managed care organization's decision. 
   Lawsuits and the increased threat of litigation will demand that more money to be funneled into non-medical administration and away from what patients really want--quality health care. Furthermore, making the courts a de facto arbiter of health care decisions seems to me to be less efficient and less effective in dealing with the interests of the patient. The Kennedy bill is an enormous gift for the trial lawyers in America who stand to profit by high cost, long-term cases. Patients, not lawyers, will fare far better under the Patients' Bill of Rights Plus. 
   I am also concerned that expanding medical malpractice liability will lead to more defensive medical decisions regardless of the merit of a particular treatment. High liability exposure and cost has driven countless physicians from their profession for years, particularly in high-need rural areas. 
   This is not a provision we can afford in rural areas of western States like Colorado that are already under-served. 
   Rather than take health care out of the doctor's office and into the courts, the Patients' Bill of Rights Plus Act establishes strict time frames for internal and external appeals for the 124 million Americans who receive care from self insured and fully insured group plans. Routine requests would need to be completed within 30 days, or 72 hours in specific cases when a delay would be detrimental to the patient. Rather than use the courts in cases of health care appeals our legislation would establish a system of independent, internal and external review by physicians with appropriate expertise. We are talking about doctors with years of experience and medical training making health care decisions, not legal arguments. 
   I believe that such a system will be more responsive and more tailored to the needs of every individual patient--and it will do so without creating unnecessary bureaucracy. It is also important to note that these internal and external appeals will cost patients and employers considerably less than the alternative proposal that is heavy on lawsuits, lawyers and litigation. 
   Another area of concern that I believe needs to be incorporated in any sensible managed care reform legislation is the inclusion of protections for patients from genetic discrimination. The Patients' Bill of Rights Plus Act would prohibit all group health plans and insurers from denying coverage or adjusting premiums based on predictive genetic information. The protected genetic information includes an  individual's genetic tests, genetic tests of family members, or information about the medical history of family members. 
   No one should live in fear of being without health care based on genetic traits that may not develop into a health problem. 
   Mr. President, I believe these provisions will empower the individual, not the lawyers or bureaucracies. I am committed to the notion that each individual American consumer of health care is in the best position to chose where his or her health care dollar is best spent. 
   An administrative issue involved in this debate that I am very concerned with is the effort to attempt to force all health plans--not just HMOs--to report the medical outcomes of their subscribers and the physicians who treat them. This makes sense for a managed care plan such as an HMO, but it would be virtually impossible for a PPO or indemnity plan to monitor and classify this data without becoming involved in individual medical cases. 
   I believe that if we require all health plans to collect and report data like this we will be requiring all plans to be organized like an HMO. This would significantly reduce the number of choices consumers and employers currently enjoy in selecting their health care. 
   The Congressional Budget Office recently determined that if S. 6, the Kennedy version of the Patients' Bill of Rights, were to pass that this country would see private health insurance premiums increase 6.1 percent above inflation. What appears to be a minor increase to health care premiums would have disastrous and immediate consequences around the country, adding 1.9 million Americans to the ranks of the uninsured. In my home state that translates to 32,384 people. In Colorado the average household would lose $203 in wages and 2,989 jobs would be lost by 2003 for this ``minor'' increase. 
   We are talking about people in Colorado losing their jobs and their health care coverage because Washington wants to do what the State of Colorado has been working on for the last thirty years. 
   The Congressional Budget Office determined that our bill, the Patients' Bill of Rights Plus Act, would increase costs by less than 1 percent. While I urge my colleagues to be wary of any potential increase in costs for the American people, I also believe that the Patients' Bill of Rights Plus, and not the current Kennedy bill, directly addresses health care quality issues and increases choice for consumers with a minimal cost.

   Mr. ALLARD. As the chairman of the Foreign Operations Appropriations Subcommittee, is the Senator aware of a proposal by the Administration to support the sale of some ten million ounces of gold by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) from its gold reserves in order to provide debt relief for countries under the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative (HIPC)?

   Mr. ALLARD. I share the chairman's concern. The sale of IMF gold would have the effect of depressing gold prices well beyond the twenty year low to which the price of gold has already plunged. As I think the Senator from Kentucky well knows, a further drop in the price of gold will not only hurt American industry but cost thousands of U.S. workers their jobs. Equally important, falling gold prices will directly impact 36 of the 41 nations that are slated to benefit from the HIPC program. This is because those 36 nations are in fact gold producers, and their economies would suffer to such a degree that the damage done to their economies resulting from depressed gold prices would be greater than any debt relief they might receive. Does the Senator agree with that analysis?

    Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, in the June edition of Leatherneck magazine, the Commandant of the Marine Corps, General Charles Krulak, quotes his father as saying: ``The American people believe that Marines are downright good for the country.'' I agree with The Commandant's father. And I am pleased General Krulak also holds that well founded opinion. The United States Marine Corps is collectively good for this country, and the services of individual marines such as General Krulak are a big part of that positive contribution made by the Corps. 
   Unfortunately, the title of the article in which General Krulak quoted his father was ``A farewell to the Corps.'' General Krulak will be retiring after four years from his position as Commandant at the end of this month. I would like to thank him for his service and efforts on behalf of his Corps and his nation. 
   Although I have been on the Armed Services Committee a short six months, I have had several good experiences with the Commandant. 
   I think the most notable was in May of this year, when a large group of my constituents were taking a tour of the Pentagon, and the Commandant invited them into his office. He said then that he usually tries to do something similar--bring tourists into his personal office--everyday. I do not think Krulak was fully aware of what he was getting himself into, but all fifty or so crowded their way into his office, and listened while he spoke about the Corps, the moving of his office down from the `barbed wire surrounded hill of the Naval Annex' to the corridors of the Pentagon, and the Corps' efforts and ability to turn young men and women into marines. 
   Let me tell you, they were impressed. They were impressed with his position, they were impressed with his efforts, they were impressed with his commitment, and they were impressed with the man. 
   I have also had correspondence with General Krulak relating to our work on S.4, and for the process of preparing the defense authorization. He consistently strikes me as a man who is well aware of the challenges his position holds, and works to meet them. He has been straightforward and dependable. Hearing testimony from him at committee hearings is always a pleasure. He does not rattle off bland platitudes. I felt that I could always rely on his opinion to be the truest possible interpretation of the situation, and one that held the best interests of the country at the foremost. 
   Let me end by repeating: General Krulak has been fundamentally good for this country. I wish him well in whatever new course he sets for himself. 
   Also, I would like to welcome General James Jones into his role as the 32nd Commandant of the Marine Corps. I have met with him only very briefly, but I look forward to working with him. I am sure he will follow in the able footsteps of all the past United States Marines Corps Commandants, and serve the Marines and America admirably.

    Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, most of my colleagues in this body, I'm sure, remember my predecessor, Hank Brown. He represented me for 10 years as the Congressman from Colorado's 4th district, and I had the further privilege of working with him during my 6 years in the House. Since he retired from this body in 1996, I have relied on  his knowledge and experience. As you might know, Senator BROWN is now President Brown, the head of the University of Northern Colorado, in Greeley, the Senator's hometown. 
   Recently, President Brown spoke at the Colorado Prayer Luncheon in Denver. He spoke on God's love, and our role in this world. His thoughts are, as always, particularly insightful and relevant. 
   I ask to have these inspirational words printed in the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD. 
   The remarks follow. 
   Remarks of Hank Brown, Colorado Prayer Luncheon 
   Ladies and Gentlemen, today is a day of renewal. It is a renewal of our commitment to our Maker as well as a renewal of our commitment to each other. The fact that so many different faiths join together in this luncheon is a sign of our commitment to each other's religious freedom. 
   The incomprehensible tragedy at Columbine is on all of our minds. It will reshape our lives as well as the families of the victims. Its impact will be with us for many years. 
   Next month it will be 46 years since my brother died in a gun accident. He was only 16--not much younger than the children who were murdered at Columbine. The other day my mother said to me that not a day goes by that she doesn't think of him and miss him. I suspect that the parents and loved ones of the victims at Columbine will be the same. The memory of those children will be with them every day for the rest of their lives. 
   How do we explain it? How do you reconcile the tragedy in your own mind? 
   We believe our God is good, we believe our God, is love, we believe our God is all-powerful and capable of controlling everything. How could something this evil be allowed to happen? It's not a new question. It's been with mankind throughout history. 
   A few thousand years ago, a fellow by the name of Job had the same questions. He was devout, religious and pious. He was committed to carrying on the work of his Lord, yet great tragedies were visited upon him. He lost his home. He lost his fortune. He lost his health. He even lost his beloved children. But he didn't lose his faith. And throughout it, he asked ``Why?'' Was he being tested? Was he being punished? I'm not sure we know. His friends came and talked to him, and they suggested that he must be being punished, that he must have done something wrong. And yet, of course Job hadn't. He hadn't been evil; he hadn't sinned. He'd kept the faith. The attitude of his friends perhaps is parallel to the way many of us think. It is natural to think that if we are good, if we follow the rules, if we observe the mandates, good things will happen to us. And yes, if we sin, we'll be punished. And yet, Job hadn't sinned. I don't pretend to know the answer. But I want to speculate with you this afternoon, and I want to suggest that part of the answer lies in God's purpose for our lives in this world. 
   What if this earthly existence is not intended to be a paradise? What if our Maker's real kingdom is not of this world? What if the purpose of our earthly existence is to train us, to prepare us, to test us--not for this world, but for the next? What if the commandments of Moses and the admonition to love each other is not a checklist for prosperity in this world, but guidance for how we'll behave when we truly accept grace? Not a way to earn grace, but what we'll do if we accept it. What if those commandments are the best advice in history on how to live a joyous life and find happiness on earth? It's a different thought, isn't it? If it's so, then our earthly existence may not be about earning our way to heaven or even enjoying a perfect life on earth. It may be about learning and preparing for the next life. 
   Parents face every day, something of the challenge that our Lord must experience. How do you prepare children for life? We love our children more than life itself. Do we do their homework for them? Perhaps some of you have faced that question. If you don't help them with their homework, they may fail and they may not have the chances you hope for them. But the story doesn't end there. If you do it for them, what do they learn? How do they learn that they have to prepare in advance for the next time? How have you helped them learn a lesson for life? 
   Growing up, I couldn't understand my mother. How could she be so tough? She never once bought the stories I brought home about how everyone did it, how it must be OK because everyone else got by with it. In fact, she was never even tempted by them. I recall a series of incidents of her forcing me to confess my sins--once to a storeowner a few blocks from here where I'd taken some gum, once to my grandmother, once at school. Those forced confessions resulted in unbelievable embarrassment. How could she do such a thing? If I wanted something, her answer was, ``I'll help you find a job.'' I worked 20-40 hours a week while I was in high school, and, in the summers I had one or two full-time jobs, depending on the summer. My parents were divorced. She worked full-time. She didn't have a lot of time to supervise me. But her strength was to keep me busy, and she kept me so busy I almost stayed out of trouble. As I look back, I wonder whether I have been near as good a parent as she was. 
   I will never forget the Clarence Thomas hearings, and I suspect some of you may have that feeling as well. One of the instances I recall was a question posed by a senator--a person of great integrity--who had very strong doubts about Clarence Thomas' judicial philosophy. When his turn came to ask questions, the senator said, ``Clarence Thomas, I see two Clarence Thomas's, not just one. I see one that seems so kind, generous, thoughtful and warm. And then I see one that is mean, cruel and hard. Which one are you?'' Justice Thomas responded immediately. He said, ``There is only one Clarence Thomas. And I am him. I used to wonder how my uncle could pretend to care for me so much and be so hard on me. It wasn't until later that I learned that he was the one who loved me the most.'' 
   I wonder if our Lord has in mind to prepare us for a life to come. Could tragedies and trials in this life prepare us for the next? It's a question worth asking. The year my brother died, I was 13. My grandfather gave me a book, It was written by Woodrow Wilson. It was a wonderful little book called ``When a Man Comes To Himself.'' It had as strong an influence on me as any book I've read. Wilson, as you know, was an idealist. In the book he talks about what the real joys in life are. He observes that the real pay one gets from a job is not the paycheck at the end of the month, although that's important. The real joy comes from what you do. A bricklayer or carpenter can drive through town and see the homes they've built providing shelter and warmth for families. Others can look at the work they've done and see how it impacts lives and changes the people they know. Wilson's thesis was that you are what you do with your life. You've seen those ads where they say you are what you eat. I sincerely hope that's not true. His thesis was that you are the role you play among your fellows. If that's true, ask what your life amounts to. Wilson's thought was that we are the sum total of how we help each other and the role we play amongst others. Perhaps that's a good guide for us to evaluate what we do in life. It's also a pretty good guide to examine whether you've found the real joy in life. 
   I don't know the answer to Job's question. Like you, I am troubled by the events and the currents of evil in the world. I, like you, suspect that our responsibility is to do what we can to make sure the tragedy never happens again. I'm not sure there's a surefire formula to prevent disasters. But I do believe that the freedom God gives us to live our lives and make our choices surely must be designed to prepare us for another world and help us understand that we have a role in making this world better. If we learn from this, and all of us go forth determined to make a difference from this moment on, the tragedy, in one way, will have served to make our world a better one. 
   Thank you.

   Unfortunately, the title of the article in which General Krulak quoted his father was ``A farewell to the Corps.'' General Krulak will be retiring after 4 years from his position as Commandant at the end of this month. 
   I would like to thank him for his service and efforts on behalf of his corps and his nation. 
   Although I have been on the Armed Services Committee a short 6 months, I  have had several good experiences with the Commandant. 
   I think the most notable was in May of this year, when a large group of my constituents were taking a tour of the Pentagon, and the Commandant invited them into his office. He said then that he usually tries to do something similar--bring tourists into his personal office--everyday. I do not think Krulak was fully aware of what he was getting himself into, but all 50 or so crowded their way into his office, and listened while he spoke about the corps, the moving of his office down from the `barbed wire surrounded hill of the Naval Annex' to the corridors of the Pentagon, and the corps' efforts and ability to turn young men and women into marines. 
   Let me tell you, they were impressed. They were impressed with his position, they were impressed with his efforts, they were impressed with his commitment, and they were impressed with the man. 
   I have also had correspondence with General Krulak relating to our work on S. 4, and for the process of preparing the defense authorization. He consistently strikes me as a man who is well aware of the challenges his position holds, and works to meet them. 
   He has been straightforward and dependable. Hearing testimony from him at committee hearings is always a pleasure. He does not rattle off bland platitudes. I felt that I could always rely on his opinion to be the truest possible interpretation of the situation, and one that held the best interests of the country at the foremost. 
   Mr. President, let me end by repeating: General Krulak has been fundamentally good for this country. I wish him well in whatever new course he sets for himself. 
   Also, I would like to welcome Gen. James Jones into his role as the 32d Commandant of the Marine Corps. I have met with him only very briefly, but I look forward to working with him. I am sure he will follow in the able footsteps of all the past U.S. Marine Corps Commandants, and serve the Marines and America admirably.

   Mr. ALLARD. I thank the Senator from Vermont for yielding to me. I am not going to take a lot of time. 
   I want to recognize the leadership and fine work he has done in fighting to get this to the floor of the Senate. I am obviously disappointed, as he is, in the fact we are not going to have a vote on this. But I do have some charts and, like my colleague, will talk about the importance of renewable energy, particularly in the context of wind energy, geothermal, and solar energy. 
   The Senator's State, like the State of Colorado, has done a considerable amount in this area. It is important to the State of Colorado. In fact, we have a research laboratory in Colorado just to address things we are talking about on the floor. 
   I just wanted to recognize in a public way the Senator's contribution and effort in trying to move forward with renewable energy. It has been a pleasure to be associated with my colleague on this amendment. 
   I thank my colleague, the Senator from Vermont, for once again standing firm in his commitment to renewable energy. I concur with the Senator from Vermont and would like to share my thoughts on the importance of funding the Department of Energy's renewables budget. 
   While the record clearly shows that I am a dedicated fiscal conservative, I also see the importance of spending a little now, to save a lot more later. By investing in the research and development of these energy sources today, we are saving taxpayers billions of dollars tomorrow in costs associated with much more than energy. Mr. President, it is not an exaggeration to say that our future as a nation and a community depends in part on the decisions we make today when it comes to energy matters. In this modern day of technological boom, energy literally runs the world in which we live. From the cars we drive to the homes we live in, without affordable, accessible sources of energy, we open ourselves up to dangers that we simply cannot allow to happen. 
   In their paper titled The New Petroleum from the January/February 1999 issue of the publication Foreign Affairs, my colleague from Indiana, Senator LUGAR, and former CIA Director James Woolsey argue the importance of increasing our use of alternative energy sources, in this case, biofuels. They appropriately note that, ``New demand for oil will be filled largely by the Middle East, meaning a transfer of more than $1 trillion over the next 15 years to the unstable states of the Persian Gulf alone--on top of the $90 billion they received in 1996.'' As a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, and Select Committee on Intelligence, I hear first-hand about foreign nations that are working to use energy sources to neutralize. I would hope that the rest of my colleagues share my concerns about sending $1 trillion over the next 15 years to rogue nations in the Middle East who are developing weapons of mass destruction as we speak, with an intent to harm American interests. We must be firm in our decision to develop accessible, affordable and dependable sources of energy here at home--our security may depend on it. 
   The environmental benefits of renewable energy are also well noted and do not need too much repeating. Not only are renewable sources of energy beneficial to our national security, but they reduce, and in fact help to eliminate harmful greenhouse gas emissions. Wind, solar, geothermal, biomass, photovoltaic and other renewable energies have few if any harmful by-products. It is simply good policy to do all we can to effectively harness and utilize the natural, clean, re-usable sources of energy that are abundantly all around us. 
   I would like to illustrate a few Colorado-specific points if I may. 
   The Solar Energy Research Facility at the Department of Energy's National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) in Golden, Colorado houses over 200 scientists and engineers. This building was designed to use energy efficient and renewable energy technologies--like the photovoltaic panels seen here--and reduce costs by 30% from the federal standard. Much of the Department's funding that was cut by the Committee goes to this vital facility in my state. 
   NREL is on the cutting edge in bringing renewable energy technologies out of the laboratory and into the mainstream of American business and society. Recognizing that America has rivals in many Asian and European nations in investing in the development of these technologies, NREL deserves credit for many wonderful accomplishments. 
   Wind power use in Colorado is becoming increasingly popular. If you've ever spent any time along the foothills of the Rocky Mountains, you know that the wind can whip down from the mountains quite fast. That wind can be easily harnessed for energy. Public Service Company of Colorado operates several wind powering facilities, one of which is in Northern Colorado on the Wyoming border in Ponnequin. Expansions of many wind facilities in Colorado are taking place as we speak. In many Northern Colorado communities, demand for wind energy has risen so dramatically that the Platte River Power Authority of Ft. Collins is planning to more than triple the installed capacity of its wind farm just across the border in Medicine Bow, Wyoming. Residents in this area can look forward to making a positive contribution to the environment. 
   The current levelized cost of wind energy is between 4 and 6 cents per kilowatt-hour, with a goal approaching 2.5 cents by 2010. According to NREL, the cost of this technology has already decreased by more than 80% since the early 1980's due to continued cost-shared R&D partnerships between industry and DOE. 
   The developable, windy land in just 5 western states could produce electricity equivalent to the annual demand of the contiguous 48 states. Total worldwide wind energy generating capacity now exceeding the 10,000 megawatt point with expectations of 100,000 megawatts by 2020. Thanks to continued research and development, the industry has grown from being California-based to having wind sites in 18 states. 
   Photovoltaic water pumping systems are being used on hundreds of ranches and farms across the U.S. to bring power to remote locations--like in some parts of Colorado--that would otherwise cost tens of thousands of dollars in extending existing power lines. In locations where solar resources are not bountiful, other renewable technologies, like wind energy, can be used in a similar fashion. 
   This is an application of renewable energy that interests me greatly. For those farmers who live in remote areas, renwable energy systems also offer distinct advantages in agricultural applications where power lines are subject to failure due to flooding, icing or other seasonal changes. These energy technologies also make sense where electrical needs are relatively small or are seasonal. 
   In conclusion, I want to reiterate my belief that investing in research and development of renewable energies is a win-win solution in every sense. Jobs are created, taxpayer money is saved, our national security is enhanced and the environment is protected. The future of our security and prosperity depends on the commitments we make today.

    Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I would like to join the Colorado banking industry in saluting an outstanding member of the Colorado community, Don Childears, President/CEO of the Colorado Bankers Association. Mr.  Childears, a native of Colorado, born in Saguache, received his undergraduate degree from Colorado State University and his Juris Doctor from the University of Denver, College of Law. 
   For over 25 years, Mr. Childears has worked tirelessly building alliances between bankers, community leaders, and legislators. As the voice of commercial banking in Colorado, Don has effectively and faithfully championed the vital role of banking in our economy on both a national and state level. 
   As a national leader in banking, Don chaired the American Bankers Association (ABA) State Association Division in 1991-1992; he assumed the post of Vice Chairman of this division the previous year. As Chairman, he guided the representation of all state bankers associations in the United States. Don was also Chairman of the ABA Regulatory Burden Task Force from 1992-1994 and was given the honor of addressing the General Session of the ABA's Annual Convention and Banking Industry Forum in Boston during 1992. Don was the only state association executive to have done this in 17 years. This year, Don was asked by the Governor of Colorado, Bill Owens, to serve on Colorado's Task Force on Y2K Preparedness. 
   Don has served educational institutions as a Trustee for both the Graduate School of Banking at Colorado, University of Colorado, University of Colorado, Boulder, and the Graduate School of Banking, University of Wisconsin-Madison, since 1980. As a banking spokesman, Don has always made himself available to public speaking opportunities, which has included everything from teaching courses on government, political influence, and banking at the Graduate School of Banking at Colorado to addressing civic groups of all sizes and descriptions on a variety of topics. He has also been heavily involved in various charitable fund-raising and political campaign committees across the state. 
   The recognitions and awards that have been bestowed upon Don are many, as you may have gathered. He is a leader in his community on many different levels. Beyond that, though, Don is an invaluable resource to the banks of our nation, and in particular in my state of Colorado. I am proud to call Don Childears my friend and to recognize his efforts.

   Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, first of all, I want to say that I support the piece of legislation that has been brought forward by Senator MCCAIN, working with the Senator from Oregon, and also the efforts of the Senator from Connecticut in that regard. 
   I believe that we need to address a very important issue that is in this amendment. I appreciate the work that Senator MCCAIN and the Commerce Committee have done to craft this important and vital piece of legislation, especially in our high-technology society. 
   I support this effort to encourage prompt resolution of Y2K problems, minimize business disruptions, and discourage unnecessary and costly lawsuits. However, I am concerned about one aspect of this proposal: State laws addressing year 2000 liability issues will be preempted by Senate bill 96 unless we specifically provide for protection of stronger State statutes. I am proposing an amendment to do just this. 
   The Colorado State Legislature passed a strong statute which specifically addresses the Year 2000 liability issue. 
   Our Governor signed the legislation on April 5, 1999, and it will be effective July 1, 1999. 
   Colorado's law provides certain protections from damages for businesses that experience a year 2000 problem. While the intent of this state law is similar to that of S. 96, the state's protections are stronger than those proposed in S. 96. 
   Colorado's statute will be overridden by the Federal legislation we are considering today. 
   My State is not the only one in this situation; Texas, North Dakota, South Dakota, Virginia, Florida, and Arizona have also passed Year 2000 liability legislation that is stronger than this Federal law would be in one way or another. 
   The State laws are consistent with the intent of S. 96 and were supported by a broad cross-section of concerned groups. 
   In addition, 17 other States have pending Y2K legislation that is near passage. 
   We should not be working to nullify the States' efforts. I am offering this amendment in order to allow the greater State limits on damages and liabilities to stand. 
   The intent of S. 96 as it relates to State law is confusing, and most troublesome is the provision stating that the Federal law will supersede State law to the extent that it is inconsistent with the Federal law. 
   I am sure that several of my colleagues will be interested in protecting their States' Year 2000 liability laws. 
   I encourage those Senators to support my amendment, and I encourage  others to consider the justification for preempting State laws outright, especially those laws that establish stronger limits than proposed at the Federal level. 
   I ask for the yeas and nays.

   Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, this Amendment will give the Department of Defense the ability to significantly strengthen the dental benefits for over 270,000 of our nation's military retirees and their family members. 
   The TRICARE retiree dental program began on February 1, 1998 and is an affordable plan paid for exclusively by retiree premiums. According to the Department, the enrollment in the program has exceeded all projections. While current law covers the most basic dental procedures, the Department of Defense does not have the flexibility to expand their benefits without a legislative change. Our nation's military retirees have expressed a desire to both the Department and the contractors for more services, and are willing to pay a reasonable price for these extra benefits. 
   Currently, the retiree dental program is limited to an annual cleaning, filings, root canals, oral surgeries and the like. This amendment would change the law to allow, but not mandate, the Department the opportunity to offer an expanded list of benefits such as dentures, bridges and crowns, which are needs characteristic of our nation's retired military members. If the Department decided to offer these service, they would continue to be paid for by member premiums. 
   In conclusion, I would ask the support of all my colleagues for this important amendment to allow the Department to give the needed dental services to our valued military retires. Thank you for the time.

   Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, first of all, I want to reiterate how important the Civil Air Patrol is to States such as Colorado, particularly in the mountainous regions. They have played such a vital role when we have had downed aircraft in the Mountain States. They have been a nonprofit civilian organization ever since 1946, and they have been designated since 2 years after that as an auxiliary. After all, it is the Civil Air Patrol, not the Defense Air Patrol or the Air Force Air Patrol. This is the Civil Air Patrol, and it is volunteers. That has been its focus. That is the strength of the organization. I think any effort at this point to put it under the control of the Air Force is premature. 
   I am glad to hear that my colleague from Oklahoma has recognized the fact that we can do a GAO study to look at the budget aspects of some of the discrepancies that supposedly come out; and then if we can get the inspector general to go in and look at how the management side of it is handled and get concrete recommendations back to the Senate, then we can go ahead and have some hearings next year. That makes good sense to me. I hope we can accept that plan and move forward. 
   So if they want to go with a voice vote, that is acceptable to me, with the idea that we have a GAO study and we have an inspector general study, and then we have some hearings and get the facts laid out. 
   I think Senator HARKIN, my colleague from Iowa, has made a good suggestion, that we need to get both of them in the same room to talk about these differences. I think there is all sorts of room to correct some misunderstandings between the Air Force and Civil Air Patrol. I think we can do it in an honest manner. 
   So I think the Allard amendment is reasonable. I think it has a reasonable approach, and I urge my colleagues on the Armed Services Committee to work with us on the Allard amendment. 
   I ask unanimous consent to add another cosponsor to the amendment, Senator ROD GRAMS of Minnesota.

We all, I think, agree that we need to understand the problem before we can come to some satisfactory conclusion. I think the plan does that.

    Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I'd like to take a moment to honor an individual who, for so many years, has exemplified the notion of public service and civic duty and an individual the western slope of Colorado will find difficult to replace. 
   Senator Tilman Bishop, a true Colorado native, represented Colorado's 7th District in the Colorado State Senate for 24 years and before that, 4 years in the Colorado House of Representatives. From 1993 to 1998 he also served as president pro tem of the senate. His years of service rank him 4th in the State's history for continuous years of service and he is the longest serving senator from the western slope of Colorado. 
   Senator Bishop has, for decades, selflessly given of himself and has always placed the needs of his constituents before his own. I had the honor of serving with Senator Bishop in the Colorado State Senate from 1983 to 1990 and have always valued his advice and counsel. 
   The numerous honors and distinction that Senator Bishop has earned during his years of outstanding service exemplify his dedication to the legislature and his constituents. Senator Bishop's wisdom and knowledge will be sorely missed. 
   Senator Bishop's tenure in the State legislature ended in 1998. There are too few people in elected office today who are prepared to serve in the selfless and diligent manner of Tilman Bishop. His constituents owe him a debt of gratitude and I wish him and his wife Pat the best in their well-deserved retirement.

   Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, the amendment I have offered, with Senator HARKIN, and others, dealing with the Civil Air Patrol, is, in the greater scheme of this defense authorization, probably not that big a measure. But for the Civil Air Patrol, its members, an the job they do, it will prevent a huge and unfortunate change. 
   This defense authorization contains a provision that would force the civilian, volunteer, locally controlled Civil Air Patrol wings into a more rigid and centralized Air Force command structure. 
   My fellow sponsors of the current amendment and I feel this forced change would hamper the patrol, hinder their activities, and hurt, ultimately, results. 
   The Air Force fights wars. Their structure and administration are designed for fighting wars. The Civil Air Patrol, a nonprofit civilian service organization, is fundamentally different. 
   The Patrol was started to watch our borders during war time. But now their focus is search and rescue, counterdrug operations, and humanitarian efforts. 
   Last year, the patrol saved 116 lives through their search and rescue operations. In 1998, they also flew 41,721 hours in support of counterdrug operations. Over the last 4 years, the Patrol membership has increased 20 percent, and the youth cadet program has increased its membership by 30 percent. 
   Newspaper are full of stories about Patrol efforts to find downed planes, lost hikers, and others, or emergency flights to provide supplies, transport people, and shuttle other vital items. 
   After the recent tornados in Oklahoma, Patrol wings flew damage assessment missions for relief authorities. 
   In January, the Colorado wing found two missing hikers in Mesa Verde park in Colorado. In April, they flew search and rescue looking for the Miller family of Iowa. As the Omaha-World Herald said on Tuesday, May 11, ``When a small plan goes down in the unforgiving mountains of southwest Colorado, the story seldom ends well.'' But the Patrol kept at it, doing what they have been called on to do time and time again. 
   The Air Force conducted a week long review of the Patrol at national headquarters. They found what they  deemed to be irregularities. The Civil Air Patrol has responded to the review, point by point. They have shown a willingness to deal with the Air Force by instituting some of the proposed measures, an by negotiating on the others. But from my understanding the Air Force, however, does not wish to negotiate in a sincere manner. 
   While I understand Air Force Secretary Peters position, I do not believe the only option on the Civil Air Patrol was to do it the Air Force Way. I would prefer to do it the correct way. 
   And so what is the proper congressional response now? This section of the defense authorization is certainly not the answer. The provision that we are trying to remove with this amendment could very well be a ``fix'' for something that is not broken, or a surgical amputation instead of a band-aid. 
   There have been allegations of financial impropriety and safety lapses. I am willing--in fact, I am eager--to have these fully investigated. 
   The amendment before us mandates a Department of Defense Inspector General audit on the financial and management structure of the Civil Air Patrol, and requires them to present the report, with recommendations, to the congressional defense committees. The amendment likewise calls for the GAO to investigate and make recommendations on the CAP management and financial oversight structure, as well as the Air Force's management and financial oversight structure of the Civil Air Patrol and their recommendations for improvement. Both reports are due by February 1, 2000, so that we can consider the reports and recommendations for next year's authorization. But the amendment does not overwhelmingly change the makeup and leadership of the Patrol, without hearings, congressional oversight, or joint party consultations. It allows us to take an informed and reasoned approach to dealing with the allegations. 
   The Civil Air Patrol is not some loose-cannon. It is not some rogue agency. The Patrol is already an auxiliary of the Air Force. Their financial practices are overseen by the Air Force. Air Force personnel must sign off on Patrol expenditures and billing. Air Force personnel work at Patrol headquarters, with daily access to financial records, and these records are all public information. 
   I do not know the motives for this attempt to subsume the Patrol into the Air Force after all these years. If the desire is merely to react to charges of impropriety, then the language as it stands is obviously excessive, and our amendment is the far better approach. 
   But if I don't know the reason why, I certainly know reasons why not to allow this language. 
   I worry the Patrol will lose its local control. 
   It is very important in States such as Colorado that we have immediate decisions when a plane goes down. Because we live in a State that has a lot of rough terrain, the weather changes quickly and dramatically, it is important that decisions be made quickly. With our local decisionmaking process, those decisions do get made properly and we can get out and save peoples' lives, in States such as Colorado, through the efforts of the Civil Air Patrol. It will sour those locally based volunteers who make up the overwhelming majority of the wings, who donate their time and energy and often equipment. Many of the assets of the Civil Air Patrol are gifts the Patrol received from donors willing to give to a charitable organization. How can we justify the Air Force wresting control of these items away from the local volunteers? How can we justify the added expense of substituting high-ranking, paid, benefit-earning Air Force personnel for unpaid, volunteer Civil Air Patrol leadership? How can we justify doing it with so little discussion, so little oversight, so little recognition of the severity of the action? 
   I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I yield myself 5 minutes. 
   In response to comments in the cases that were presented by my esteemed colleague from Oklahoma--I will add at this point, it is a pleasure to serve with him on the Armed Services Committee; he is somebody that I highly regard in the Senate, a very honorable individual. I know that he has a love for the Civil Air Patrol and he wants them to be able to do their job effectively. I know that his concerns are out of love for that very organization, because he is a pilot himself. I will respond that from the information I have on the misallocation of the personnel uses, I understand there is a high probability that that occurred. But in other organizations where this happens, we don't go and just take away complete control of the organization without some hearings, without some oversight from this Congress. 
   I understand that the Air Force has spent some time in overviewing it, and it has been done within the structure of the Air Force. I think, before we move ahead with an amendment as dramatic as what is in the defense authorization bill before us, that we ought to have some hearings, that we ought to, as Members of Congress, spend some time and delve into the actual facts. 
   I don't think we can do this without having some agency do some reporting for us. That is why in the amendment that I have put forward, I ask the GAO to look at the financial structure--this is an area my colleague has suggested where there could be some problems--and report back to Congress whether or not there are abuses. And also in the amendment, I have the Inspector General, who can look at the administrating aspects of it, how they established policy, see if they are following through with their goals, if they are doing what they have promised to the Congress and to the Air Force, and give a report on those incidents. 
   And we ask that this be given in a timely manner so that next year when we come back in and this bill is before us then we can go ahead and look over the report and, hopefully, maybe have a hearing or two based on the report and put something reasonable and responsible forward. 
   I have some real concerns about saying, OK, we are going to turn over total control to the Civil Air Patrol, take it away from being a voluntary nonprofit organization. That is almost like a chapter 11 in the real business world. When you take over the board of directors, you completely change everything. 
   I don't think it is that serious. I don't think we ought to put the Air Force in control of the board of directors. But I do think there are some things that we need to investigate. For example, on the cruise issue brought up by my colleague, my understanding is  that the Air Force was the one that OK'd the disbursement for that cruise. So there might be some question of where the responsibility lies, who was culpable for some of these actions. I know the Air Force has some oversight on some of the equipment. 
   Now, maybe we don't have the Air Force doing what their responsibility should be. So if that is the case, then there might be enough blame here to go around to everybody. I think the only way, as Members of the Senate, we can begin to sort this out is if we have hearings, we ask for a report from the General Accounting Office, and ask the inspector general to give us a report, so we have some facts on which we can work. 
   For that reason, I am continuing to push my amendment. I hope the Members of the Senate will support me. A number of my colleagues also come from mountainous States where the Civil Air Patrol is vital and their response needs to be made on a local decisionmaking process. We can't be waiting to go out to search until after it has been filtered through Washington and goes back to the State. On these search efforts, when they come up, there is an immediate need and there has to be an immediate decision made locally. 
   My hope is that we can adopt my amendment and take out the more onerous provisions that we have in the bill until we can get the facts before us. And then, after we have those facts, perhaps we can move forward in a more informed and responsible manner. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. ALLARD. I thank the Senator from Oklahoma for yielding. In response to the Senator from Oklahoma, I agree that funding for our military has been dismal, particularly in light of the fact that this administration has continued to have more deployments than President Bush and President Reagan put together. Yet, we have cut defense from time to time, and I am very sympathetic to and voted for increased funding for the Department of Defense. I understand there are problems with the Air Force, but I think this is where the Civil Air Patrol, with their voluntary program, helps with the budget; they don't hurt the budget. 
   If we have shortages at the Air Force, as far as adequate funding for oversight, it seems to me that taking over the whole program is going to require more personnel, more time, and it is going to cost the Air Force 
   more. It seems to me that the responsible thing to do at this particular point is to, first of all, get our studies and facts in order and then find out if we can't come up with a commonsense resolution that has some reasonable oversight by the Air Force and still keep this a voluntary organization. The strength of it is the voluntarism. I hate to take that away from it. I think we save the Air Force money. 
   So that is why I believe it is important that we go ahead with the amendment that I am proposing, because I think in the long run the Air Force can benefit. We just have to get the oversight problems taken care of. We can do that. Once we get the facts before us--and that is what my amendment does--then we can move forward. 
   I thank the Senator for yielding.

   Mr. ALLARD. All Members cosponsoring this amendment recognize we have some oversight problems. We are struggling because we don't have the facts firmly before the Senate. It seems to me, as with any other problem that comes before this Senate, we can go through the same channel as any other agency. We can have hearings--public hearings; we can have a GAO study, and an inspector general study to have some basis in fact with which to work. Once we have all the facts, we can put together some reasonable recommendations. 
   At this point, to turn total control over to the Air Force is a rather draconian action until we get the facts. I hope I can sit down with the chairman of the committee and the chairman of the subcommittee, whom I respect dearly, and work out a way to make it accountable without having to turn over total control to the Air Force. 
   I am afraid we will lose the volunteer aspect. I think that is one of the real values of the Civil Air Patrol. The volunteer aspect used to go down to young students, high school age. They learn to work the radio; they learn to be part of a team; they get experience with flying, and eventually they may very well apply to the Air Force Academy or the Navy to fly. I think it is a great recruiting mechanism with lots of advantages. I think it all boils down to the volunteer organization. 
   My hope is we can work out a plan that would bring accountability to this very serious problem yet maintain the volunteer aspects of the organization and local control.

   Mr. ALLARD. I will sit down with my colleagues, both of my colleagues, and go over some of this language. The way I read the language, the Air Force Secretary appoints the national board of directors, and they have total control over the rules and regulations. It looks to me as if they have total control. Maybe I am misinterpreting it. 
   I am willing to sit down with my colleague and see if this happens or not, and maybe we can work out a compromise. 
   With that in mind, I yield the floor so the chairman can move ahead.

    Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the accomplishments of the 1998 United States Air Force Academy Football Team. 
   The 1998 ``Falcons'' may go down in history as one of the greatest football teams in Academy history. Their 12-1 record included their first outright Western Athletic Conference Championship, a bowl victory over the University of Washington, and the Commander-in-Chief's Trophy, which is the most prized possession of the three service academies. 
   This team of over-achieving young men was lead by their Head Football Coach Fisher DeBerry, and his assistant coaches Richard Bell, Todd Bynum, Dee Dowis, Dick Enga, Larry Fedora, Jimmy Hawkins, Jeff Hayes, Cal McCombs, Tom Miller, Bob Noblitt, Jappy Oliver, Chuck Peterson, and Sammy Steinmark. They are recognized as one of the finest coaching staffs in the country. 
   On offense, the team was lead by seniors Mike Barron, Joe Cashman, Spanky Gilliam, Ryan Hill, Frank Mindrup, Blane Morgan, James Nate, Dylan Newman, Matt Paroda, Brian Phillips, Barry Roche, Jemal Singleton, Matt Waszak, and Eric Woodring. 
   The defense was lead by seniors Tim Curry, Bryce Fisher, Billy Free, Jeff Haugh, Jason Sanderson, Mike Tyler, and Charlton Warren. 
   Special team seniors Jason Kirkland and Alex Wright took care of the punting and place kicking duties. 
   The most impressive thing about these outstanding young men is that following their graduation from the Academy they will all be moving on to serve our county as 2nd Lieutenants in the United States Air Force. They are true student athletes who play the game for the enjoyment of the sport. These young men are tremendous role models for the youth of our country, and our nation can take pride in their accomplishments. 
   I commend the Superintendent of the Air Force Academy, Lt. General Tad Oelstrom, and Athletic Director Randy Spetman for their leadership in development an outstanding group of young men. They clearly possess the ``right stuff.''

   Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the Roberts amendment. The reason I do that is I think that the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, which we refer to as NATO in this debate, is suffering from mission creep. I look at what has happened with the Strategic Concept in 1991. I look at the passing of the 1999 new Strategic Concept, and I think it becomes clear how mission creep is moving in. 
   In 1991, NATO established a new Strategic Concept which altered the concept dramatically from the original treaty. It allowed for more flexibility in the ability to get into a wide range of military operations. However, I add that it did maintain in part 4, under Guidelines for Defense, entitled ``Principle of Alliance Strategy''--I want to quote specifically from that Strategic Concept.  
   The alliance strategy will continue to reflect a number of fundamental principles. The alliance--  
   And this is underlined--  
   The alliance is purely defensive in purpose. None of its weapons will ever be used except in self defense. And it does not consider itself to be anyone's adversary.  
   Then, if we look at the 1999 new Strategic Concept, it still says that their core purpose is the collective defense of NATO members. It adds that NATO:  
   ..... should contribute to peace and stability in the region.  
   But, while a lot of the debate here on the floor has been about what does the Concept say, the important point I want to make here is what is important is what it does not say. In the 1999 new Strategic Concept, there is no mention that the alliance will never use its weapons except in self-defense. So, in 1991 the new Strategic Concept said the alliance was purely defensive in purpose. In 1999, there is no mention that the alliance will never use its weapons other than in self-defense. 
   I think that is a real important distinction. That is why I think it is so important we have a debate on the mission of NATO.

   Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, today I rise in strong support of S. 1059, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2000. 
   As the Personnel Subcommittee chairman, I take great pleasure in which Senator CLELAND, the ranking member, and the other members of the subcommittee were able to provide for our men and women in uniform. Every leader in the military tells me the same thing, without the people the tools are useless. We must take care of our people and the personnel provisions in this bill were developed in a bipartisan manner. 
   This bill is responsive to the manpower readiness needs of the military services; supports numerous quality of life improvements for our service men and women, their families, and the retiree community; and reflects the budget realities that we face today and will face in the future. 
   First, military manpower strength levels. The bill adds 92 Marine personnel over the administration's request for an active duty end strength of 1,384,889. It also recommends a reserve end strength of 874,043--745 more than the administration requested. 
   The bill also modifies but maintains the end-strength floors. While I do not believe that end-strength floors are a practical force management tool, I am personally concerned that the strength levels of the active and reserve forces are too low and that the Department of Defense is paying other bills by reducing personnel. Therefore, it is necessary to send a message to the administration that they cannot permit personnel levels to drop below the minimums established by the Congress. 
   On military personnel policy, there are a number of provisions intended to support the recruiting and retention and personnel management of the services. Among the most noteworthy, are the several provisions that permit the services to offer 2-year enlistments with bonuses and other incentives. This is a pilot program in which students in college or vocational or technical schools could enlist and remain in school for 2 years before they actually go on active duty. 
   Many Senators have expressed their concerns about the operational tempo of the military. That is why this bill attempts to address this problem by requiring the services to closely manage the Personnel and Deployment Tempo of military personnel. We would require a general or flag officer to approve deployments over 180 days in a  year; a four-star general or admiral to approve deployments over 200 days and would authorize a $100 per diem pay for each day a service member is deployed over 220 days. The briefings and hearings in the personnel subcommittee have found that the single most cited reason for separation is time away from home and families. At the same time, the services have not been effective in managing the Personnel and Deployment Tempo for their personnel. I am confident that the provision will focus the 
   necessary attention on the management of this problem. 
   Another important provision is the expansion of Junior ROTC or JROTC programs. A number of members and the service Chiefs and personnel Chiefs told me that they believed Junior ROTC is an important program and that an expansion was not only warranted but needed. Thus we have added $39 million to expand the JROTC programs. These funds will permit the Army to add 114 new schools; the Navy to add 63 new schools; the Air Force to add 63 new schools; and the Marine Corps to exhaust their waiting list to 32 schools. This is a total of 272 new JROTC programs in our school districts across the country. I am proud to be able to support these important programs that teach responsibility, leadership, ethics, and assist in military recruiting. 
   In military compensation, our major recommendations are extracted from S. 4, the Soldiers', Sailors', Airmen's and Marines' Bill of Rights Act of 1999. First, this bill authorizes a 4.8-percent pay raise effective January 1, 2000 and a restructuring of the pay tables effective July 1, 2000. 
   Another provision includes a Thrift Savings Plan for active forces and the ready reserves and a plan to offer service members who entered the service on or after August 1, 1986, the option to receive a $30,000 bonus and remain under the ``Redux'' retirement or to change to the ``High-three'' retirement system. In order to assist the active and reserve military forces in recruiting, there are a series of bonuses and new authorities to support the ability of our recruiters to attract qualified young men and women to serve in the armed forces. There are also several new bonuses and special pays to incentivize aviators, surface warfare officers, special warfare officers, air crewmen among others to remain on active duty. Two additional provisions from S. 4 are in this bill. A special retention initiative would permit a service secretary to match the thrift savings contribution of service members in critical specialties in return for an extended service commitment. Also, thanks to the hard work of Senator MCCAIN and Senator ROBERTS, another provision authorizes a special subsistence allowance for junior enlisted personnel who qualify for food stamps. 
   In health care, there are several key recommendations. There is a provision that would require the Secretary of Defense to implement a number of initiatives to improve delivery of health care under TriCare. Another provision would require each Lead Agent to establish a patient advocate to assist beneficiaries in resolving problems they may encounter with TriCare. 
   Finally there are a number of general provisions including one to enforce the reductions in management headquarters personnel Congress directed several years ago and several to assist the Department of Defense Dependents School System to provide quality education for the children of military personnel overseas. 
   Before I close, as a first time Senator subcommittee chair, I express my appreciation to Senator CLELAND for his leadership and assistance throughout this year as we worked in a bipartisan manner to develop programs which enhance personnel readiness and quality of life programs. I also thank the members of the subcommittee, Senator THURMOND, Senator MCCAIN, Senator SNOWE, Senator KENNEDY, and Senator REED, and their staffs. Their hard work made our work better and helped me focus on those issues which have the greatest impact on soldiers, sailors, airmen and marines. 
   Mr. President, I finish by thanking Chairman WARNER for the opportunity to point out some of the highlights in the bill which the Personnel Subcommittee has oversight and to congratulate him and Senator LEVIN on the bipartisan way this bill was accomplished and ask that all Senators strongly support S. 1059. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. ALLARD. I stand corrected. I thank the Senator from Utah. 
   Basically, there are two parts to this amendment. There is a part which we refer to as the ``findings'' part, and another part which deals with the actual statutory change. 
   The first part, in findings, just says the local school district, working with the school board and the administration and the parents and the students  in a school, if they decide to hold a memorial service or to erect a memorial, if they reach a local consensus, there is a finding by the Senate and by the Congress that it is OK for them to go ahead and do that. It is just a finding. It is not a change in law. 
   There is a second part that does deal with statutory changes where there is a change in law, and that says if there happens to be a lawsuit based on the first amendment or one of the other amendments, then on the first amendment it says the school district would pay for its own legal expenses and then the litigants would then pay for their own; whoever is suing would pay for their own legal expenses. 
   The second part of it says the U.S. Attorney General may defend the school district in the lawsuit. It is a very straightforward amendment. 
   The parents of Cassie Bernall recently contacted me about the difficulty they have encountered in establishing a memorial for their daughter. This is in relation to the Columbine High School tragedy. To quote Cassie's father:  
   Our Cassie was the young woman who boldly answered to a gunman ``yes'' when he asked if she believed in God, prompting him to pull the trigger. Cassie's response did not surprise us....... It was from her strong faith in [Jesus Christ] and His promise of eternal life that she was empowered to make her stand. 
   My wife ..... and I both believe any Columbine incident memorial should memorialize each individual in a personal way. Everyone knows ..... that Cassie was a very strong Christian. To leave this facet of her persona out would be to mis-memorialize her and others.  
   Mr. and Mrs. Bernall strongly support the amendment that I am proposing today because they have experienced already a threat to their first amendment rights. 
   I urge the Senate to vote yes for the Allard amendment. 
   I yield back the remainder of my time. 
   Mr. President, reclaiming my time, I have been informed that I have another 2 1/2 minutes.

   Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, first of all, I thank the majority leader for giving me an opportunity to participate more fully in this legislative process and for his profound concern for the people of Colorado. The majority leader has been especially sensitive to this tragedy as it affected the students, parents, teachers, administrators and the support staff at Columbine High School in Littleton, CO. I appreciate his willingness, along with the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, to work with me on possible solutions in the youth violence bill. There will be proposals to try and prevent future tragedies of this nature in our Nation's schools. There will be those who will try and take advantage of this tragedy for their own personal gain. Sadly, in some cases, some people have already sought to gain from this horror. 
   There will be those who will want to completely ignore the problem believing that it will go away on its own. There will be those who share the views of many editorial writers in Colorado that this is a very complicated issue and that no simple solutions are going to be forth coming. These writers echo my views that only a comprehensive examination of all the contributing factors will yield smart, effective policy. 
   The natural reaction is to seek simple solutions by laying blame. Was it inadequate laws? Inadequate enforcement? Do we blame parents, teachers, students themselves, administrators, politicians, organizations, the entertainment industry, churches, or the whole of society? Do we blame the Constitution of the United States? 
   We need to put all this finger pointing aside and realize that we didn't come to this point overnight, that no one-thing is culpable, and that finding sensible solutions will take some time. Now is the time to concentrate and focus on what can be done about the emerging violence we are seeing in our schools. This is the time for us to look for responsible solutions. Now is the time to try and come up with common sense solutions that will make schools more safe. 
   The Constitution of the United States is one of civilization's greatest documents. It has served magnificently as the basic governor of this nation, the world's greatest nation, as it has developed and thrived for over 200 years. The Constitution continues to serve us well and will serve us well as we go through dramatic change in the future. 
   It is the bedrock and the foundation that moves us through national crises while preserving individual freedom. It empowers and checks the government in thoughtful, humble, and timeless language. I would like to take this opportunity to briefly examine the Bill of Rights in the context of today's world and in light of the recent shootings in our schools. 
   During the most recent violent school crisis in Colorado and previously in Oregon, Arkansas, Kentucky, and Mississippi, we are suffered the sense of loss, pain, anger, and frustration from each event. We collectively witnessed the anguish of students, teachers, parents, administrators, and law enforcement through an intense and at time intrusive news media invasion. The wide and dramatic coverage of these events often inspires copycat crimes. But we do not throw out the first amendment. 
   We have seen what happens in societies where there is no freedom of the press. We have witnessed the danger of censorship and government control of the media most recently in Iraq and Yugoslavia; ruthless dictators shut off the free flow of information to strengthen their grip on people who don't enjoy the benefits of a free press! Yes, some who report the news can be insensitive, irritating and down-right rude, but the alternative is far worse. Most news reporting is responsible. 
   It seems as though we re flooded in today's world with acts of violence from guns, knives, and bombs. Anger wells-up inside us as we read and witness such senseless acts of violence, especially in our schools which are supposed to be safe havens for learning. There are many responsible, law-abiding Americans who own and use firearms today. 
   We have witnessed many cases where ruthless dictators have moved early in their reign to disarm their soon-to-be victims. 
   Yes, of the 270 million people in this country there are a few who are a menace to society with the guns that they own, but we cannot forget the many responsible gun owners in the United States. Guns have sporting uses, but they also save lives. Let us not forget that guns have been used to protect people, and they will continue to do so in the future. 
   The third amendment to the Constitution talks about the excesses of the military in terms of the home. It recognizes the right of the citizen to have his own home and to have it as his sanctuary free from any soldier claiming a greater right than the citizen. In times of civil crisis we occasionally see the military used to ensure safety. 
   Most soldiers are dedicated and trustworthy servants of this country and it is only on the rare occasion that one is not. Throughout these crises in our schools we have seen a highly charged and emotional police force move to secure the area and conduct an investigation. People are calling for quick action, looking for people to blame, and being critical of every move. The fourth amendment protects students, teachers, administrators, and parents from unfounded accusations and unwarranted seizures. It protects them from the crafty criminal who may want to shift the focus and action to an innocent party. One does not have to look far to see that people in parts of Central America, Iraq, and Yugoslavia do not have this right. During these times of crisis in our schools, people in and around these institutions are protected by due process of law. 
   They cannot be deprived of their life, liberty, and property without due process of law; nor shall private property be taken for public use without just compensation. Some Americans want to disregard these provisions in a time of crisis. There are those who demand immediate resolution regardless of cost, but here we see the grandeur of the fifth amendment as it protects people from whims and the heat of a crisis. 
   In any time of urgent need or catastrophe, the innocent may fall victim to false accusations. This is particularly obvious when elected officials are trying to show the electorate that they can produce results. We have seen the innocent accused and then exonerated by the justice system in cases of violence in our schools, and for this we owe the sixth amendment to our Constitution. 
   During these troubling times in our schools there are claims of injury placed against those who have had a public responsibility. The vast majority of our public servants are good decent Americans who work to serve other people. There are a few, for one reason or another, who fail to carry out their responsibilities. The method for redress in these sad circumstances is provided in the seventh amendment. 
   In responding to the horrific events in our schools the justice system is required to balance bail and punishment with the crime committed. The eighth amendment provides for this process to be fair and judicious. 
   And what of rights not clearly enumerated in the Constitution? The ninth amendment expressly states that as sweeping and dedicated to liberty as the document is, it cannot provide for all freedoms. The ninth amendment allows for the protection of rights not clearly defined by the Constitution indicating a wisdom that we embrace as we approach any crisis. 
   The 10th amendment prevents the Federal Government in times of crisis from ignoring the role of the States. Our forefathers feared most of all not the military but a national police force. 
    The individual states were given the basic responsibilities of law enforcement, and in times of school crisis we have witnessed the effectiveness of this provision. We have also witnessed  through our history many nations terrorized by a national police force. In these cases isn't an armed citizenry capable of defending itself the preferred but not perfect solution? 
   My purpose for reviewing these vital amendments to our Constitution, this grand Bill of Rights, is to illustrate that in times of crisis, these rights are the layers of a foundation of liberty on which we live. This bedrock is the sacred strength of our nation. It is the bedrock that supports our churches, our homes, our businesses, and our schools. A natural tendency in times of crisis is to drive wedges into this bedrock in search of a solution. It is my hope that we conduct this debate upon the bedrock, and not within it. 
   I hope during this debate we keep in mind that we do not have the power to eliminate all violence in all schools. We must strive to restore a safe environment for learning within the bounds of individual freedom. A few must not be allowed to destroy that which the American people have prospered and come to appreciate over several centuries. Common sense and sensitivity must prevail. 
   In that light I believe there are things we can do to address school violence. There are no simple solutions and it will not happen overnight but I believe we can begin to move down that road by improving the safety in our schools. Even though schools will be our focus, the problems we face go far beyond the walls of any school, any community, any state, or for that matter any country. The laws we pass will have far reaching effects on numerous aspects of our society. I look forward to proceeding through this legislative agenda in a thoughtful manner, mindful of our sacred responsibility to the bedrock of our nation--the Constitution and the Bill of Rights. 
   I was recently given the honor and privilege of chairing a task force on Youth Violence. This task force, composed of twelve Senators, has thoughtfully deliberated over the problem of youth violence for the past two weeks. Our efforts are, in part, a response to the recent tragedies seen in our nation's schools. We support S..254, the Juvenile Justice bill, and the efforts of Chairman HATCH and his committee who have labored for the past several years to draft careful reforms that will positively impact our juvenile justice system. In addition, we have come to a consensus on several themes which affect juvenile crime, education and our culture. This package of legislative proposals applies reasonable reforms which we hope will enhance the work of Senator HATCH and his committee. 
   The consensus of themes our task force will be working toward this week are: 
   Stengthening prevention and enforcement assistance to State and local government. This is the first step in a plan which infuses funds to State and local authorities to combat juvenile crime. The Federal government will assist states best by providing flexible block grants. Our plan includes juvenile crime grants; improving our management of juvenile crime records; targeted prevention funding; a plan for graduated sanctions which begin early--when the first signs of delinquent or antisocial behavior appear, and alternative education opportunities for at-risk or problem juveniles. 
   Another point is pushing back the influence of cultural violence by empowering parents and encouraging the public to be socially responsible. 
   Our second step is to help our culture do more to limit the exposure of America's children to harmful and violent entertainment. Following the recent tragedy in my state, it seems clear that our culture's fascination with violence played some role in the thoughts and motivations of the cruel perpetrators of the crimes in Littleton. This includes enacting an entertainment industry code of conduct that allows for further development and enforcement of rating systems to limit exposure to children of material that the industry itself has deemed inappropriate for children. We include a plan to investigate the marketing practices of the entertainment industry where children are concerned. This plan also includes empowering Internet service providers to offer screening and filtering software that is designed to empower parents to limit access to material unsuitable for children. Our package also includes a plan to prohibit the posting of bomb making instructions on the Internet. 
   Last, I am offering two amendments which liberate students and faculty to hold memorial services or to construct a memorial on school property in the aftermath of a tragedy. 
   I will conclude my statement today with remarks on these amendments. The final theme of our package reinforces the theme that it is time to get tough on violent juveniles and firearms used by criminals. The Republican plan makes it more difficult for a juvenile to gain access to a firearm and insures that violent juveniles--teenagers who commit violent crimes--will be held accountable for their actions. We do this by ensuring the prosecution of those who abuse existing firearms laws. This means directing the Department of Justice to make firearms prosecutions a priority--something they have not been so far. We address gun show safety and firearms background checks, juvenile firearms possession, and penalties for firearms offenses across the board. We increase the penalty for theft of a firearm and we increase the mandatory minimum sentences for those who corrupt youth by selling them or encouraging them to sell drugs. 
   We also address safe and secure schools. Republicans want all children to receive a quality education. This experience should be a safe one. We propose numerous options for schools to use federal funds for better teacher training regarding violent students and school security. We provide for mandatory school discipline records disclosure for transferring students; we allow for all schools the opportunity to institute address code or school uniform policy; and we free up teachers and school administrators to adequately discipline students while at the same time giving them limited liability protection. Our bill establishes a national center to boost school security efforts and creates a national award for children with character. 
   In proposing this package, we do not pretend to believe our legislative actions will erase the harm already inflicted on too many Americans. Nor do we believe these laws will guard against all future threats of youth violence. But I do believe that the Congress has an opportunity today to strengthen and enhance our existing laws to empower families and communities to take action against this cultural virus seen in our youth. 
   Our responsibility is to apply reason and temperance to the decisions we make this week, holding close the dearly held principles of life and liberty which are expressed in our Bill of Rights. I am hopeful that the Senate will work together to accomplish this objective. 
   I would like to say a few words regarding my proposed amendments that will be before the Senate the first part of this next week. In the aftermath of the Littleton tragedy, I propose these amendments which will allow Congress to go on record with respect to the constitutionality of a permanent memorial or a memorial service that contains religious speech. Of course, the Allard amendments do not put Congress on record with respect to the kind of memorial that would be appropriate--that decision is for local schools and communities. The Allard amendments do, however, declare that a fitting memorial may contain religious speech without violating the Constitution. 
   As you approach Arlington National Cemetery, signs are posted which say:  
   Welcome to Arlington National Cemetery, Our Nation's Most Sacred Shrine. Please Conduct Yourselves with Dignity and Respect at All Times. Please Remember these are Hallowed Grounds.  
   Similarly, Congress appropriates the funds to pay for chaplains who conduct memorial services not only at Arlington Cemetery but wherever they are needed to serve our departed men and women of the Armed Forces and their families. We recognize that paying for chaplains to conduct memorial services is not an establishment of religion by the Government, but a dignified and proper Government function. The Supreme Court has noted that the chaplaincies of the various branches of the service are constitutional. Likewise, no one could seriously contend that the signs identifying Arlington Cemetery as a sacred shrine and hallowed ground are establishments of religion. 
   So today I am offering an amendment which states that it is fitting and  proper for a school to hold a memorial service when a student or teacher is killed on school grounds. And it is fitting and proper to include religious references, songs, and readings in such a service. 
   Memorial services help the grieving process of students and faculty, bring a school together in the face of tragedy, and meet a need deeply felt by so many to see their friend given recognition in a dignified and solemn manner. My amendment allows students and faculty of a public school to hold a memorial service that includes prayer, reading of scripture, or the performance of religious music at a memorial service that is held on the campus of a public school in order to honor the memory of any person slain on that campus. 
   As a part of my proposed amendment there is a section that allows for the construction of a memorial that includes religious symbols or reference to God on school property. In either case, if a lawsuit is brought forth, parties are required to pay their own fees and costs and the Attorney General is authorized to provide legal assistance to defenders. 
   This is not the equivalent of a daily school prayer. A memorial service is a very specific response to an unusual circumstance, a circumstance I hope we will not have to revisit again. The amendments specifically mention that religious songs may be sung at such memorials without violating the Constitution. The two federal appeals courts that have taken up this issue both have ruled that school choirs may sing religious music. And the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals held that it was constitutional for a public high school choir to have ``The Lord Bless You and Keep You'' as its signature song. 
   In the same way, erecting a memorial that contained religious references, such as a quote from scripture, or a religious symbol from the deceased's religious tradition, would not violate the establishment clause of the Constitution. 
   In any community visited by such a tragedy, a person who views such a memorial with religious symbols or references that were important to the deceased would certainly not see some sort of covert attempt to establish an official religion. Rather, they would see a fitting and proper memorial to a departed friend. 
   I urge my colleagues to support my modest proposal. This legislation does two things. It requires that if a school holds memorial services or puts up a memorial in response to a killing on school grounds, and the school is sued, then all parties will bear their own costs and attorneys fees. A school that has experienced a tragedy of this kind should not have to worry about someone bringing a suit and winning thousands and thousands of dollars in attorney fee awards just because the school decides to hold a memorial service or put up a memorial. Second, this legislation permits--but does not require--the Attorney General to aid a school in defending against these suits. 
   This is one small thing we can do to help our schools respond in a humane, compassionate, and constitutional way to the violence that has become far too common in our schools. If the people of Colorado believe that religious speech is necessary to memorialize the heroism and tragedy at Columbine High School, then let them express themselves with the most profound and durable expressions of the human heart. Let us adopt this amendment today, hoping an occasion for its use may never happen again. 
   I yield the floor.

    Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to draw attention to an anniversary. Forty years ago yesterday, the Colorado Boys Ranch Foundation was incorporated. Yesterday they celebrated forty years as a leader in the field of youth work. 
   The Colorado Boys Ranch places emphasis upon youth, especially those who are vulnerable to or troubled by the negative influences and pressures of our society. Their motto is ``It's easier to build a boy than mend a man.'' 
   Thirty eight years ago, my predecessor, Senator John Carroll of Colorado, spoke on this floor on the merits of the then still new Ranch, and I am here to echo the spirit of his comments. 
   Colorado Boys Ranch was created through volunteer labor and public and private contributions. This ranch is located just north of La Junta, Colorado. In 1959 the La Junta Chamber of Commerce and the Colorado County Judge's Association had a vision to build a treatment center for wayward youth coming from broken and unloving homes. The City of La Junta had received from the United States Government an abandoned WWII air field, and they gave the Foundation the civilian housing area from that field. Businesses and volunteers immediately came forth with offers to help remodel this facility to accommodate plans for the Ranch. 
   Of the committee of ten that started the ball rolling, two are still alive. Of the four judges that were involved personally, only one remains. Their volunteerism inspired others over the past forty years, and the overall efforts have been great and still continue strong to help the Ranch in its great efforts. 
   Over the past forty years, 4,000 plus youth have been treated at Colorado Boys Ranch and over 85% have continued on to be productive citizens. The Ranch is accredited with commendation by the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations, and is certified and licensed by the Colorado Department of Human Services, Mental Health and Education. 
   The Colorado Boys Ranch program is based upon the following beliefs: That preserving families and family ties takes continual effort and a spirit of renewal. That youth require essential life experiences and skills to maximize their growth and development. That something special happens when the lives of youth and animals connect. And, that CARING BRINGS RESULTS. 
   Recently, the Ranch received the Samaritan Institute Award for Ethics. This prestigious award is presented annually to a non-profit organization that best illustrates the importance of ethical values through its chartered work and its partnership with the business community. 
   I commend the goals of the ranch, and its purpose as a leader in the field of working with vulnerable youth and helping them find their role in modern society. I invite you to visit the Colroado Boys Ranch should you ever be in the state--over its forty year history, it has served youth from over twenty states across our nation. 
   Mr. President, the fortieth anniversary of the Colorado Boys Ranch Foundation would be special any day that it happened to fall upon, but today it is especially notable. We debate today on youth violence and youth crime, and ways to curb that horrible scourge. The Ranch has found a solution, a solution that will not perhaps work across the whole nation, but is certainly working for those it serves.

   Mr. ALLARD. I would like to reiterate Senator GRAMM's remarks and thank Senator JEFFORDS for his interest and insights. As chairman of the Subcommittee on Housing and Transportation, I plan to hold a hearing to examine the need for preservation of affordable rental housing. Specifically, I will focus on the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Section 8 program with particular attention to prepayment and opt-out issues. I also plan oversight of HUD's implementation of the Multifamily Assisted Housing Reform and Affordability Act. 
   I would like to invite Senator JEFFORDS to testify at this hearing. I share many of his concerns and appreciate his willingness to work with me on these important issues.

   Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I rise in support of S. 900, the financial modernization bill. I supported this legislation as a member of the Banking Committee, and I commend Chairman GRAMM for the excellent work he has done in bringing this bill to the floor. The chairman has worked very hard to craft a bill that makes sense. It is balanced and will benefit our economy. 
   This legislation is designed to modernize America's financial services industry by providing a sensible framework for the affiliation of banks, securities firms, insurance companies, and other financial institutions. It is, of course, very difficult to craft a compromise that is acceptable to many diverse interests, but it is necessary that we do so. 
   Much of our financial services industry is governed by laws written in the 1930s. Congress has struggled with this issue for many years. I am hopeful that this is finally the year we enact this legislation. 
   I will focus my comments on several issues concerning community banks. 
   In Colorado, the community bank is an important institution. It is the center of many of our towns and rural areas. I have worked hard to represent their interests in the Banking Committee. I am a supporter of the provisions in this bill to exempt small rural banks from the Community Reinvestment Act. For small banks, the CRA, or Community Reinvestment Act, is a regulatory burden. While a large bank can often devote an entire department to CRA compliance, a small bank has to divert scarce resources toward compliance. Each of these small banks is required to undergo regular exams and actually designate a CRA compliance officer. This makes little sense when one recognizes that small rural banks could not survive if they did not invest in the community. Frankly, where else could they put their money? 
   I will read a few excerpts from Colorado banks on this very important point. 
   From the First National Bank of Stratton:  
   Your amendment removing the CRA requirement will have a positive benefit for small community banks located in nonmetropolitan areas. As a small community bank in a town of 700, the employees and the bank's officers are already involved in literally everything going on in the town. The CRA requirement provides a burdensome paper and personnel requirement for small community banks.  
   Remember, this is coming from a bank in a town of only 700 people. 
   Then from the First National Bank of Cortez:  
   In our bank, our compliance officer spends a great deal of time preparing documents for the CRA file and Bank Examiners. We estimate that it takes 80 to 100 hours each year to update the CRA file, and to date, we have never had a customer ask to see the file.  
   Then from the First National Bank in Las Animas and La Junta:  
   I strongly support the provision to remove the onerous requirements of the CRA from small rural banks. We serve our communities well and if we do not serve the needs of our community we will not exist.  
   From the Kirk State Bank:  
   As a small rural bank, the CRA is a burdensome regulation. In reality, small banks and small communities have to be good community citizens to be successful and a bureaucratic regulation does nothing to improve the situation.

   Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, these letters contain a number of views on the CRA and other provisions of the bill. 
   Now I want to talk about taxes. For over a year now, I have been working on legislation to reduce the tax burden on small banks. Last week, I introduced S. 875 along with Chairman GRAMM and Senators BENNETT, ABRAHAM, HAGEL, ENZI, MACK, GRAMS and SHELBY. 
   This legislation expands the subchapter S option for small banks. Subchapter S is a portion of the Tax Code designed for small businesses with a modest number of shareholders. The most important feature of subchapter S is that it eliminates the double taxation faced by corporations. Subchapter S businesses are taxed only at the shareholder level. 
   Congress made this provision available to banks 3 years ago. Since then, nearly 1,000 small banks have converted from C corporations to S corporations. Unfortunately, many more would like to convert. They are prevented from doing so by a number of remaining obstacles in the tax law. 
   My legislation would change this by making subchapter S available to many more banks. I will be working closely with Senator GRAMM and the Finance Committee in the months to come in an attempt to include this legislation in a tax bill. 
   Mr. President, I will include a full description of the provisions of my bill at the end of these comments. 
   I also want to talk briefly about one additional matter that has come to my attention. This is a proposal to permit banks to be organized as limited liability companies, or LLCs. LLCs were first created in the mid-1980s and have spread throughout the Nation. Virtually every State now permits businesses to be organized as LLCs, as well as corporations and partnerships. The tax benefit of an LLC is similar to that of a subchapter S corporation. Double taxes are eliminated and taxes are paid at the level of the owners. Up to this point, Federal law had limited banks to the corporate form. 
   In recent years, a number of experts have questioned this restriction, and there appear to be good reasons why we may wish to examine permitting small banks to be organized as LLCs. 
   I will provide the chairman with language on this point and ask that he take a good look at it. I want to thank Chairman GRAMM, once again, for his hard work on this bill. I have been pleased to be a member of the Banking Committee, and I am pleased to support the legislation.

    Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, on May 2, 1999, John Elway retired concluding one of the most remarkable sports careers ever. After sixteen National Football League seasons, exactly sixteen years to the day after he was traded to the Denver Broncos by the Baltimore Colts, the Magnificent Number 7 bid farewell to the team he has led to five Super Bowls and two consecutive world championships. 
   John Elway has been among the most prolific quarterbacks ever. He is the all-time winningest quarterback with 148 wins as a starter. In 46 of those wins Elway engineered game winning fourth quarter drives. He stands second in all-time passing yards and third all-time in touchdown passes. He has been elected to nine Pro Bowls, starting in eight of them. He is the only quarterback to ever throw for 3,000 yards and rush for 200 in 7 consecutive seasons. Elway started in a record 5 Super Bowls, and last year was elected MVP of the game. In addition to his peerless offensive  production John Elway has been the model of leadership and consistency both on and off the field. 
   On the field Elway missed only 15 games in 16 years due to illness or injury. This toughness is amazing considering that in 256 career games he was sacked an NFL record 559 times. Former Broncos coach Dan Reeves says that it is Elway's mental toughness that has allowed this consistency. Current coach Mike Shanahan cites Elway's competitive hunger and his confidence. What is clear at the end of sixteen years is that Elway's combined physical gifts and the mettle of his character have made him an American icon. 
   Off the field Elway has worked tirelessly for numerous Colorado charities, and his John Elway Foundation has generated more than a million dollars in contributions since its inception. The stability and commitment of the Elway Foundation insures that it will continue to make Colorado a better place for years to come. 
   In an age when so many celebrities shrink under the intensity of the spotlight John Elway has carried himself with class and dignity. It is hard to define what John Elway means to Colorado, but it is clear to me that he is more than just a football player. He is more than just a superstar. He is a figure that stands for something good, something strong and dedicated. John Elway is the athlete you don't mind being a role model. It makes you feel good to see his jersey on a kid playing in the park. I believe that says far more than any statistic. 
   I know that the people of Colorado join me in wishing John Elway and his family the very best.

   Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I compliment my colleague, the senior Senator from Colorado, Mr. CAMPBELL, for his fine floor statement. I was especially touched when he brought in the meaning of what was happening in Colorado in relation to his forefathers, the Cheyenne people. It means a lot to me personally to hear those words, because I consider us part of one big family. 
   I do have a perspective that I would like to share with the Members of the Senate. 
   Mr. President, House Concurrent Resolution No. 92 is sponsored by TOM TANCREDO. The House of Representatives approved this resolution earlier today, exactly 1 week after Columbine High School was tragically ravaged by two of its students. The school and a large majority of its students live in the Sixth Congressional District. Congressman TANCREDO represents this district and lives a short distance from Columbine High School. 
   This resolution is intended to express our feelings of sorrow about the tragedy in Littleton, CO. This resolution is also intended to express our appreciation for those in the community who responded with courage and compassion, including the students themselves. 
   Today, the State of Colorado observed a moment of silence at 11:21 a.m. mountain daylight time. This was approximately when the terrorism began 1 week ago at Columbine High School. 
   Earlier today, the Senate joined Senator CAMPBELL and me in a moment of silence and prayer led by the Senate Chaplain. On behalf of Colorado, and especially the citizens of Jefferson County, I thank you for sharing in this gesture of respect and mourning. 
   My wife Joan and I attended the memorial service this Sunday, April 25, for those who were killed: Cassie Bernall, Steven Curnow, Corey DePooter, Kelly Fleming, Matthew Kechter, Daniel Mauser, Daniel Rohrbough, Rachel Scott, Isaiah Shoels, John Tomlin, Lauren Townsend, Kyle Velasquez, and their teacher, William ``Dave'' Sanders. 
   At the memorial service, we shared our profound sense of loss with Vice President GORE, Colorado Governor Owens, Congressman TANCREDO, the students, teachers, and parents of Columbine High, and the people of Jefferson County and Colorado. 
   I have never experienced anything that compares to the collective feeling of loss, sadness, and disbelief in Colorado. I would estimate that approximately 75,000 people attended the memorial service. Among those gathered in sorrow, Joan and I witnessed a strong belief in God. We prayed together and searched for answers. 
   During the past week, many of my colleagues have come to the floor to share their condolences and concern for the students and teachers who have lost their lives or who have been injured in this senseless tragedy. I do hope that our thoughts and prayers have helped to comfort the students, parents, and teachers of the Columbine High School community. Again, I offer my deepest sympathy to those who are suffering. 
   Our Nation continues to grieve with the families and friends of the killed and injured students and teachers. We are still attempting to understand what happened and why. People are trying to cope with the terror that has crept into our lives. It has become obvious at this point that there are no easy answers. We need to examine the problems facing our youth, but it is critical that we take time to carefully consider the solutions being offered. 
   There are things that society can do, but those who are looking for easy solutions should take a step back. The families, teachers, and students of Columbine, and the people of Colorado, need time to mourn their losses. We need to wait for law enforcement to finish their investigation. We should study other instances of school violence throughout America and look for a common thread. 
   We need to carefully evaluate all of the evidence and consider the possible solutions. In addition, it has been estimated that 17 laws were broken by the two students, and we need to evaluate what the current law should have done.

   Mr. ALLARD. Whatever the solution, I am convinced that we will never alleviate the problem completely, but we certainly can reduce its occurrence. 
   It is hard to understand how two students can become so dysfunctional, but we need to continue to search for answers. There is no simple solution. We must pledge ourselves to do what we can. I ask that the Senate begin by approving this resolution. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, today I am pleased to introduce legislation that will expand and improve Subchapter S of the Internal Revenue Code. I am joined in this effort by Senators GRAMM, BENNETT, SHELBY, ABRAHAM, HAGEL, ENZI, MACK, and GRAMS. 
   The Subchapter S provisions of the Internal Revenue Code reflect the desire of Congress to eliminate the double tax burden on small business corporations. Pursuant to that desire, Subchapter S has been liberalized a number of times, most recently in 1996. This legislation contains several provisions that will make the Subchapter S election more widely available to small businesses in all sectors. It also contains several provisions of particular benefit to community banks that may be contemplating a conversion to Subchapter S. Financial institutions were first made eligible for the Subchapter S election in 1996. This legislation builds on and clarifies the Subchapter S provisions applicable to financial institutions.

   Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I support this effort to wall off the surplus Social Security revenues. 
   By establishing a lockbox we ensure that all savings in the program are used to build the trust fund and extend the solvency of Social Security. 
   We learned last year that to leave unobligated money lying around Washington is a bad idea because it gets spent! 
   This is one of several budget reforms that I have been actively supporting. 
   First, the budget process is too complicated and frequently abused. I feel it needs to be simplified. This is a step in that direction. 
   With this provision we can remove the temptation that the Social Security surplus presents to those who tend to spend our money carelessly. 
   As we search for ways to modernize Social Security, it makes sense to dedicate the Social Security surplus to repaying debt owed to the trust fund. Paying down the debt and modernizing Social Security need to happen together. 
   It is important to take this issue up now, especially since we have already considered three requests for supplemental spending for this year, totaling $1.36 billion. 
   These proposals spend the surplus without regard to major budgetary commitments such as Social Security. 
   I have long been a supporter of debt repayment. 
   I believe that Federal debt retirement should be a priority when decisions must be made regarding a Federal budgetary surplus. That is why I sponsored the American Debt Repayment Act, which requires repayment of the federal debt. 
   Likewise, I support the legislation before us today that sets a statutory limit on federal debt held by the public. 
   We must obligate ourselves to a plan in order to make any progress toward paying down the debt; otherwise, the surplus will most likely invite increased spending. 
   Consider the impact that debt reduction would have on the fate of Social Security. 
   We would be making positive changes to ensure the solvency of Social Security for future generations. 
   We would be making payments on the national debt which is the best way to provide flexibility and a source of funds for changes in Social Security that will modernize it for the generations of the next century. 
   So long as the federal government carries a $5.6 trillion debt, we cannot tell our children and grandchildren that we have provided for their future. 
   By enacting this plan we will be helping to preserve Social Security for future generations. 
   I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting the Social Security lock box to keep the Social Security surplus safe from raids that further threaten the financial condition of the fund.

    Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I wish today to recognize a group from Pueblo, Colorado--the Pueblo Pachyderm Club. This is Founders Week of the National Federation of the Grand Order of Pachyderm Clubs, and I think it is fitting that we acknowledge their civic efforts and attitude. 
   The Pueblo Pachyderm Club, and the National Federation of Pachyderm Clubs, have a motto--``Free government requires active citizens.'' Their goal is to develop future leaders and better citizenship through the promotion of wide-spread involvement by good citizens in politics. They advocate better government through club programs and open meetings, by providing scholarships for political science students, by sponsoring campaign workshops, and by encouraging awareness of political affairs. 
   The founders who have worked tirelessly for the Pueblo Pachyderm Club for years deserve special recognition. They have made the Club a fixture in the Pueblo community. The Club's regularly scheduled luncheons have become an avenue for local and state officials to meet with and listen to the concerns and thoughts of the community. 
   Bringing together citizens, and hosting politicians and officials, leads to greater and better communication and fosters the beginning of new political interests and political potential. To simplify it--the more the better. The larger the percentage of our public that is involved in policy decision making, the better. With this in mind, the Pachyderm Club continues its mission. I wish them the best.

   Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, my wife Joan and I were shocked and dismayed at the violence and bloodshed at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colorado yesterday. 
   Words cannot do justification to the deep sense of loss all of us are feeling today following the tragedy. But words--these words, and the words of our prayers--are what we have to offer now. 
   I offer my condolences to all those who lost loved ones, and to those whose loved ones have been wounded, hurt, and terrified. 
   I would like to ask America for their prayers as well. They are needed. The Columbine High School community is in shock, the State of Colorado is in shock, and America is in shock. 
   Before I left my office just now, I heard the final number of casualties--15. Fifteen lives, most of them young, ended yesterday by savage violence. 
   This is a wound, a scar, that will not be removed, and for those who bear the worst of this burden my wife and I offer all our compassion, our sympathy and our prayers. 
   We should recognize the heroism of the local police, the emergency personnel, and others who responded, as well as the heroism of the students and teachers caught in the attack. Many put their lives on the line to rescue students and escort them to safety. 
   The simple, unplanned bravery and courage of those who did whatever they could--in the midst of mayhem and terror--to avert further tragedy might never be fully known but should be fully acknowledged. 
   There are far too many of my colleagues who have had this experience--who have watched as news of school shootings and teen violence spread across the media. This tragedy erupted in Colorado, but it is part of a nationwide concern. 
   In the coming months there will be time, and there will be a need, for us to commit ourselves to finding a solution to this tragic problem. We must ask ourselves how this could happen, and what can be done to prevent it from ever happening again. There is, I am sure, no simple solution. But we must pledge ourselves to doing what we can. 
   Right now, however, I think the best response in the aftermath of this horror is, as Governor Bill Owens said, to  hug our children. To hug them, and think about providing a better, more secure future. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, today is April 15. It is Tax Day. This is the deadline by which we must file our 1040 Form and pay any additional taxes we might owe on top of what was withheld during the year. 
   Unfortunately, typical Americans will work well beyond April 15, to pay their taxes. This is because Tax Freedom Day does not come until May 11. 
   Tax Freedom Day is the day in the year to which the typical American family must work just to pay the combined state, federal, and local tax burden. For many Americans the total tax burden now exceeds one-third of family income. 
   The Tax Foundation just announced today that Tax Freedom Day will move one day further into the year in 1999. 
   Last year it was May 10, this year it will be May 11. This is the latest day ever, and it marks the sixth straight year that Tax Freedom Day has advanced a day or more further into the year. 
   As the Tax Foundation has reported year after year, in a typical household the tax bill now exceeds the cost of housing, food, transportation and clothing combined. 
   In fact, in 1999 the federal tax burden will reach a peacetime high. Nearly 21 percent of the Gross Domestic Product--that is the wealth created in the country this year--will go to the federal government. 
   As we approach the end of the 20th century it is useful to look back on the history of the tax burden. 
   The Joint Economic Committee of the Congress estimates that in 1900, the average federal tax burden on a family was 3 percent, and the average state and local burden was 5 percent, for a combined total of 8 percent. 
   As the century closes the JEC estimates the average federal tax burden on a family is 24 percent, and the average state and local burden is 11 percent, for a total of 35 percent. Mr. President, we have come a very long way. 
   The IRS estimates that 123 million families will file their tax returns this year. The tax code is so complex that nearly half of these families require the service of some type of tax professional in order to file their tax returns. 
   This means that on top of the actual tax owed to the government, there is a hidden tax for millions of Americans in the form of tax-compliance and professional services fees. Even for simple tax returns, this can add another $100 to the tax bill each year. 
   For small businesses the tax compliance costs run into the thousands of dollars. 
   Mr. President, it is time for fundamental tax reform. We should begin this process by reducing income tax rates across the board. 
   We should also eliminate complex and punitive taxes such as the estate and gift tax, and we should continue to build on our successful reform of the IRS by making it possible for most Americans to comply with the tax system with minimal expense and effort. 
   The federal government is too big, and it costs too much. We should use the budget surplus for two things, reduction of the federal debt, and tax relief. 
   The surplus belongs to the American people, it does not belong to the government. For decades the cost of government has risen, Tax Freedom Day has moved later and later into the year. 
   Mr. President, it is time for us to begin rolling back Tax Freedom Day. Let's give the American family a well earned break.

   Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Mississippi for his thought and effort in this regard. 
   Mr. President, I think we get stuck in the way things used to be. The fact is, this is a changing world. We have changing dynamics as far as what other countries are doing in regard to weapons development and what their risks may be to the mainland of the United States. 
   My colleague from Mississippi has said yes, this is a changing world out there and we need to make sure we have a national missile defense system. If you talk to the average Americans out here on the street, they think we do have a national missile defense system. The fact is, we are no longer in a cold war era where the foreign policy of threat of mutual destruction is going to be effective. We are in a modern era where countries can develop a missile rather quickly, because of the natural resources that they have--maybe it is oil and gas--and with these huge financial resources that all of a sudden become available to them. In fact, we have heard testimony in the committees on which I serve--I serve on both the Intelligence Committee and the Armed Services Committee--that the time required for a newly developed country to build a missile from scratch has halved in the last few years. That is because there is lots of technology out there, that is readily available, that they can acquire quickly. They can put this all together into a very effective offensive system if they so choose. 
   So I want to take some time today to talk about what the bill means to me, and some of the language in the bill specifically. I would like to talk a little bit about the threats of today's world and talk about the system's feasibility. We have heard comments here on the floor that we are dreaming, that this is really not that feasible an approach. I want to make some comments in that regard and talk a little bit about the cost of the system and how I think we can pay for it. And then, finally, before I conclude, I want to talk a little bit about the ABM Treaty and the treaty ramifications. 
   What does S. 257, the National Defense Act of 1999, do? Simply, the National Defense Act of 1999 states that it is the policy of the United States ``to deploy as soon as technologically possible a National Missile Defense system capable of defending the territory of the United States against limited ballistic missile attack (whether that is accidental, unauthorized or deliberate).'' 
   The bill's policy statement is identical to that of S. 1873, which was proposed during the 105th Congress, except for the addition of the statement that missile defense is subject to the authorization and appropriations process, which is an amendment we just adopted here in a vote we had around 2 o'clock or 2:15. 
   This bill does not mandate a date for deployment of a system, calling instead for deployment as soon as the required technology is mature. 
   As I mentioned earlier, the United States has no defense against these systems, but I think it is important that we continue to push for their development as soon as it is technologically feasible--that we quickly move ahead. I think this is completely compatible with the January 20, 1999, statement of the Secretary of Defense: ``The United States in fact will face a rogue nation threat to our homeland against 
   which we will have to defend the American people.'' And, he goes on to say, ``technological readiness will be the sole remaining criterion'' in deciding when to deploy a national missile defense system. 
   Secretary Cohen stated on February 3, 1999, during the Armed Services hearing, that any country which fires ballistic missiles at us will face immediate retaliation. Again, this is the old, cold war attitude of mutual destruction. While I agree with this statement, we again decide to place ourselves at the mercy of rogue states instead of being proactive in protecting our citizens, because these rogue states have the capability of developing a system of missiles with some type of warhead--whether it is bacteriological, chemical, or nuclear--and we do not have any defense system today to counteract any missile that would be headed towards the United States. 
   I would like to talk a little bit about the threats that are posed to the U.S. mainland today. I want to refer to the July 1998 Rumsfeld report on ballistic missile threats to the United States. The commissioners who put together the report concluded:  
   [T]he threat to the U.S. posed by these emerging capabilities is broader, more mature and evolving more rapidly than has been reported in estimates and reports by the Intelligence community.  
   The report goes on and further states:  
   [T]he warning times that the U.S. can expect of new ballistic missile deployments are being reduced.  
   I believe the missile threat to the United States is growing at an accelerated pace. Numerous hostile nations have declared their intent to obtain missiles capable of attacking the United States, and are succeeding in doing so. These include launches that have been made from North Korea and China, the old missile fields of the former Soviet Union--now in the Commonwealth of Independent States. I happen to believe that very soon Iraq, Iran, Libya, India, and Pakistan will have the same capability. 
   Two of the worst proliferators of ballistic missiles are North Korea and Russia. North Korea has tested a missile capable of attacking Alaska and Hawaii, and is apparently developing a second missile which will be capable of reaching the entire United States mainland. North Korea has sold every missile it has developed, and the associated technology, to other rogue states. 
   During the Armed Services hearing on February 2, 1999, Director of Central Intelligence George Tenet said:  
   North Korea is on the verge of developing ballistic missiles capable of hitting the continental United States.  
   Again, relating to the North Koreans' launch when they set off a second-stage rocket that went over the tip of Japan, Tenet said:  
   The proliferation implications of these missiles are obviously significant.  
   During the hearing, Director Tenet also warned that Russia is reneging on their earlier commitment to the United States to curb the transfer of advanced missile technology to Iran. Again, he stated:  
   The bottom line is that assistance from Russian countries is still contributing substantially to progress in Iran's dangerous missile programs.  
   He added:  
   India, Pakistan, and Iran, who have traditionally been considered technology customers, now have developed capabilities that could, in some cases, be exported to others.  
   So here we are. We have a commission set up by the United States to analyze our defensive posture and our ability to counteract a missile attack, and we have the Director of the Central Intelligence Agency both warning us that we need to update our defense system to a current situation that exists throughout the world. I happen to believe both the report as well as the comments by George Tenet. I think that we need to move forward. 
   The President's 3+3 Missile Defense Plan has already been pushed back to 2005, but the problem is that the threat is right now. It is not in 2005. In December, Robert Walpole, National Intelligence Officer for Strategic and Nuclear Programs, said in a speech that the Central Intelligence Agency was caught by surprise by North Korea's flight testing of a three-stage missile. While the third stage of the missile failed, CIA analysts had to agree to the Rumsfeld report, as I stated earlier in my comments, that the threat is here despite the CIA's dismissal of the report when it was released. 
   I want to talk a little bit about the feasibility of us moving ahead with the technology that we have today. We have the pieces of a national missile defense system with proven technology. However, the risk to development lies not in the pieces but in the integration of these pieces into an effective system in a timely manner, which is exactly what this bill does. When we talk about the term ``technologically possible,'' it includes system integration. There is no date in the bill. The bill just calls for the policy to deploy when technologically possible. 
   During a February 3, 1999, Sea Power interview, General Shelton said:   
   The simple fact is that we do not have the technology to field a national missile defense....... My colleagues--the Joint Chiefs and I--believe that when we have the technology for NMD, we ought to have the capability to be able to transition right into the deployment, if the threat warrants.  
   A followup on that, Ted Warner, Assistant Secretary of Defense for Strategy and Threat Reduction, said that the threat is no longer the issue holding back national missile defense, but technical feasibility is all that drives deployment. 
   During a February 3, 1999, Armed Services hearing, Secretary Cohen stated that the Department is committed to advancing its missile defense efforts as technology risks allow, without any mention of when the threat is there. He admits that the threat is here now. 
   I will discuss the architecture of a national missile defense system. The architecture for national missile defense consists of three pieces: the battle management system, the radars that detect incoming missiles, and the booster and ground-based interceptor that will comprise our response. 
   The battle management command, control and communications system will receive data on the incoming missiles, calculate the number of interceptors needed to destroy the missiles, and monitor the status of the test elements, giving decisionmakers a prioritized set of choices for our response. Portions of this system have already been tested and performed flawlessly in previous tests. 
   Our current detection system consists of a combination of upgraded early warning radars, new ground-based radars and our space-based satellites. Once the satellites detect a launch, they will pass the data to our ground-based radars, which will create a detection net to gather high-fidelity data on the incoming missile that will help our interceptor strike its target. The upgraded early warning radars have been rigorously tested using both computer simulations and actual test launches and are more than capable of performing their mission. 
   Their replacement, a space-based infrared radar system, will vastly improve our detection. Moreover, our targeting capabilities will be increased with the eventual deployment of a complementary low space-based infrared system which performs cold-body tracking of incoming missiles. 
   The least proven piece of the architecture may very well be the booster and interceptor. Various parts of the interceptors, such as the seeker, have been tested many times, and the test objectives have been met. Actually, just yesterday the PAC-3 missile collected, detected, tracked and gauged and then hit an incoming test missile. 
   The technology exists to build a national missile defense system. Further testing of integration should show whether the system is ready to deploy. Requiring more studies and analysis to see if the technology is here, which it is, before we decide to deploy will only place us at the mercy of a threat we already know is out there. 
   Let me speak a little bit about the cost of the system. With regard to the national missile defense budget, on one hand, the administration added $600 million from its fiscal year 1999 emergency supplemental but has yet to put forward exactly where this money will be spent. There was discussion to use part of this money for the Wye peace agreement. Then the administration added $6.6 billion over the 5-year plan for the national missile defense but pushed the majority of the money into the outyears, making it vulnerable to future cuts and the whims of another administration. I happen to believe that we should field an NMD system as soon as it works. Given that most of the system is technologically feasible already, we should be putting money in military construction and procurement starting in fiscal year 2000 and deploy much earlier than the year 2005. 
   To make a few comments about the ABM Treaty and the treaty ratification, this bill is not about the ABM Treaty, specific architecture, deployment dates, or reports. The cold war is over, and we shouldn't hold to the cold war ways of protecting ourselves, the ABM Treaty. MAD, referred to as mutually assured destruction, should not rule our defense posture. We are no longer facing a superpower but now face rogue states. 
   We keep hearing that if we deploy a missile defense system, Russia will not ratify START II. They have used this threat entirely too many times--in the bombing of Iraq, they used it; in the sanctions for missile proliferation with Iran. 
   As columnist Charles Krauthammer wrote:  
   What standing does Russia, of all nations, have to dictate how and whether the United States will defend itself? Russia is the principal supplier to Iran of the missile and nuclear technology that could one day turn New York into a Hiroshima.  
   The administration has been saying that any national missile defense is not directed at Russia. National Security Adviser Sandy Berger said:  
   It's directed at rogue states that have long range missiles. These are threats not only to us, but to the Russians.  
   In conclusion, Mr. President, a firm policy to build a defense against ballistic missiles will send a clear message to rogue states that they are wasting their money building ballistic missiles with which to attack or threaten the United States. If rogue countries decide to ignore this message, the United States will be prepared to protect itself as soon as the technology is ready against such attack or threat of attack. 
   The bill is a policy declaration, making clear to the citizens, allies, and adversaries of the United States that it will not remain defenseless against a ballistic missile attack. I believe there is a need to have a bipartisan bill, and this is a bipartisan bill. This bill was introduced by Senator COCHRAN and Senator INOUYE, and the exact same bill in the 105th Congress had three Democrat cosponsors, with four voting for cloture. 
   Let me end with a final conclusion from the Rumsfeld report and our ability to protect the threats for the future:  
   Therefore, we unanimously recommend that U.S. analyses, practices and policies that depend on expectations of extended warning of deployment be reviewed and, as appropriate, revised to reflect the reality of an environment in which there may be little or no warning.  
   I yield the floor, Mr. President, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. ALLARD. I thank the Senator for yielding for the purpose of a question. I just want to be clear that we are talking about the same issue here. My understanding is that these are the same rules and regulations proposed by the Federal Reserve, the FDIC, the Office of Thrift Supervision and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency on December 7. As I understand, the regulations are going to require banks to set up customer profiles. I cannot imagine anything more intrusive than looking into somebody's banking account any time there is a little bonus that they get in their paycheck or they give a contribution somewhere. Then they suddenly become subject to scrutiny, not only by their banker but by law enforcement agencies and by the regulators. I think that is extremely intrusive. I just wanted to clarify that. 
   The regulations that are being proposed are extremely vague and are certainly a threat to our privacy in this country. The regulations, as I understand, were drawn up to fight fraud, tax evasion, and combat money laundering, but I do believe that they are reaching entirely too far. I think these regulations are unnecessary and, frankly, I think these regulations ought to be scratched. 
   One other thing that I want to clarify with Senator GRAMM from Texas is that credit unions, security firms and insurance firms are exempt from these regulations. Again, we have one part of the financial industry being regulated and none of the other parts being regulated. I think the proposed regulations would create a lot of imbalance.

   Mr. ALLARD. These are unbelievably intrusive. I congratulate the chairman of the Banking Committee for his hard work, and, in particular, my colleague from Pennsylvania.

   Mr. ALLARD. It is interesting how their light sort of turned on after such diverse groups as the ACLU and the Christian Coalition came together and opposed these regulations. As my colleague from Pennsylvania pointed out, the regulators have received over 100,000 objections. There are so many objections coming in, that they have a hard time keeping the number up on the web page because so many people are writing in to explain their concerns. I think the American people have caught on to this folly, and I think it is a shame that we have to bring it up in this manner to address it in the Senate. 
   Again, I thank the chairman of the Banking Committee for his fight to protect the Constitution and to protect the privacy rights of American citizens. 
   It is extremely important that we do everything possible to keep from having these rules and regulations passed. They are so invasive.

   Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, my colleague from Maryland made several comments on the ``Know Your Customer'' amendment we had up for consideration before the Senate. 
   I want to take just a couple of moments to respond. The reason that I felt it was important to bring up the amendment this morning with my colleagues on this side is that I serve on the Banking Committee with my colleague from Maryland, and I made an attempt to bring this issue forward in the Banking Committee. It was objected to by the minority party at that time. We also brought up a bill here on the Senate floor for consideration, but again it was objected to by his side. It seemed that the only way we could get this issue considered by the Senate was to bring it up at this particular time. It was well within the rules of the Senate, and I thought it was very important that the Senate have an opportunity to speak on these rules and regulations before a final decision was made. 
   As to his second comment on the amendment being too broad, I admit that the amendment I introduced in the committee was broad. We wanted to do that because we were concerned that the regulators would just make minute changes in the rules and regulations, and then the regulations would be back before the American people. After further consideration, the language that was considered here on the Senate floor was narrowed and applied specifically to those rules and regulations in the current ``Know Your Customer'' proposal. 
   I just wanted to make those two comments. I also would like to thank the chairman and recognize the chairman's effort in trying to improve education in this country. I want to compliment him on his confidence in the States as well as local school boards. That is where a lot of these decisions should be made. I think there is a tendency here in Washington to think that we have all the answers, that one shoe size should fit all, and that one regulation should fit all. 
   I am one who feels that local school boards and States really are the ones that will come up with the innovative changes for education. We just need to give them the flexibility to do so. We need to allow them to work with parents who really do have a vested interest. We all want to see our children get a better education. 
   Again, I want to thank the chairman for his hard work and diligent efforts. We all appreciate that. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, wilderness is described in the law as lands that are, ``*.*.* in contrast with those areas where man and his own works dominate the landscape, *.*.* an area where the earth and its community of life are untrammeled by man, where man himself is a visitor who does not remain.'' With today's introduction of the Spanish Peaks Wilderness bill congressmen SCOTT MCINNIS, BOB SCHAFFER and I are setting aside around 18,000 acres of land that more than meets the intent of the authors of the 1964 Wilderness Act. This land will be an important addition to wilderness in Colorado. 
   Spanish Peaks had been considered for inclusion in previous wilderness bills. However, because of unresolved issues it was not appropriate to designate it in the past. Those issues included various inholdings, the use of an old access road in the wilderness area, as well as the potential coal bed methane production on portions of the land. Those issues have either been resolved in this bill or they have been resolved through other methods. The resolution of these issues has maintained the integrity of the proposed wilderness area as well as protecting the needs of the local community. 
   Because of this, the legislation should have the backing of the local community, Colorado environmental groups, and the majority of the Colorado delegation. There is no reason why it cannot be passed quickly. 
   All Colorado wilderness bills should go through the process this bill went through. Congressman MCINNIS, Congressman SCHAFFER and I decided that cooperation, consensus, and communication were essential to success. Therefore, we casted our net broadly for concerns, and when they were raised in good faith we actually sat down and worked them out. I have been struck by the fact that when people are given the opportunity to be part of the process they feel like they have a stake in the outcome and they try to be constructive in their criticisms. Because of constructive critics like the Huerfano County Commissioners, this legislation is better now then it was when they first looked at it. 
   Whil the legislation is complete, we are still seeking clarification on one point. The Huerfano County Commissioners are seeking to have a trail that is slightly inside the wilderness area, as designated in the legislation, excluded. My staff has spoken with the local Forest Service staffer and they appear to have no objection to this change. It is still uncertain whether we actually need to change the legislation to do this or whether the map can be adjusted by the Forest Service without any legislative changes. If it is the former than we will make that change prior to passing it out of the Senate. If it is the latter, we will exchange letters with the Forest Service to ensure we are talking about the same trail in the same place. This change should not be of concern. It is only slightly inside the boundaries and any changes we make to exclude it would be of only a slight impact on the entire designation. 
   I want to thank Congressman MCINNIS, Congressman SCHAFFER, and the local community for working through this process. When the Colorado delegation works as a team they work the best for the State of Colorado.

   Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I should like to personally welcome the guest Chaplain today, Dr. James Olson, who is from my home State of Colorado. I wish to also thank Dr. Lloyd Ogilvie for his graciousness in welcoming him here to the Senate. 
   My wife Joan and I are blessed that we have inspirational leaders both here in Washington and back in my home State of Colorado. Dr. Lloyd Ogilvie is somebody we really respect and value and look to for our spiritual leadership. Dr. James Olson is not only a spiritual leader for my wife and I in Colorado but of the family, and I just wish to state in a public manner how much we appreciate his leadership and how much as a family we appreciate what he does for us. He has not only personally served the Allard family, but he has personally served the community of Fort Collins, CO. He has taken an active part in that community as a religious leader, and in his sermons in the Faith Evangelical Free Church of Fort Collins he has been a leader of affairs before our country, and I think he has been a voice of reason for the congregation and one of balance. I have always appreciated his message on Sundays whenever we have attended his church, and I think that he has strengthened the spiritual community in Fort Collins, particularly the Christian community. 
   I just want to recognize in a public way all his leadership in Colorado, particularly his community. I think he typifies the leadership throughout this country of many of our community pastors and religious leaders. Sometimes I don't think we recognize them as we should. They are an important part of what goes on in this country; they are an important part of what America is all about. 
   So it is with a great deal of pleasure that I welcome Dr. James Olson to the Senate and let him know just how much we appreciate his prayer this morning and wish both his wife Carol and him our very best. We are happy that they could take time out of their religious lives to come to Washington and be a part of the Senate today.

   Mr. ALLARD. Madam President, I thank the Senator from South Carolina for his remarks, and I appreciate the leadership he has shown over the years on the issues that are important to the Armed Services Committee, on which I serve with him. It is an honor to serve on the committee with both he and Senator WARNER as chairman. 
   First, I want to commend the Chairman for his efforts. Senator WARNER's leadership on ushering S. 4 to the Senate floor has been significantly important. Without his insistence and courage to move ahead, we could not be where we are today on this bill. 
   I'm glad this is the first bill to come before the Senate, not just for substantive reasons but for the message we are sending to our men and women in uniform. They put their lives on the line everyday for our freedom and they need to know they will receive what they earn. We need to continually send the message that we care about them and the families they have to leave while on duty. 
   Unfortunately, I believe this message has not been sent during the last six years. From the Secretary of Defense down, we have been hearing the difficulty the services have had in recruiting and retaining their service personnel, and complaints about the gap between the military and civilian pay. During the last six years, the defense budget has decreased 25 percent in real economic terms, while at the same time our troops have been sent abroad 45 times--and this doesn't include the latest journey into Kosovo. I do not now want to argue the need for all these deployments, but I will say that we cannot keep asking our armed services to do more and more while giving them less and less. This trend must be reversed and fast. S. 4 is the first step in changing this downward trend. But, better pay and benefits is only one step in improving the quality of life for our soldiers. Soon, we must address the problems of frequent deployments, prolonged absences, readiness shortfalls and the other myriad problems facing our military or else all the important changes in this bill will be lost. 
   The first problem I want to address is the issue of pay. If we want to keep the best and brightest then we need to pay them at levels favorable with salaries in the private sector. The current pay gap is anywhere between 5.5 to 13.5 percent and is projected to exceed 15 percent by the year 2005. Pay raises have lagged behind the average private sector raises for 12 of the last 16 years. I agree with Secretary Cohen and General Shelton when they say that we can never pay our military personnel enough, but we can pay them too little--and that is what has been done over the last decade.

   Mr. ALLARD. The retention problem is not just felt at space command but cuts across all the services. Secretary Cohen, General Shelton, and all the service secretaries and chiefs say that the men and women are our greatest assets, but, unfortunately, we are losing our greatest assets in mass numbers. 
   I ask the rhetorical question of whether we would let our planes and ships disappear. Then why should we stand by and let this happen? Planes, ships, tanks, guns, and the rest are useless without properly trained personnel. 
   The Air Force has stated they are 855 pilots short this year and expect to be short 2,000 pilots by the year 2002. This leaves the Air Force with less experienced pilots and higher training costs. Their enlisted retention is no better. 
   I would like to refer the Members of the Senate to a chart that I have drawn up here which points out the enlisted retention rate for 1998. The first term reenlistment goal is 55 percent, but in 1998 it was only 54 percent. The second term reenlistment goal is 75 percent but only achieved 69 percent. The career goal is 95 percent while only getting 93 percent reenlistment. This is the first time that the Air Force has failed to meet its retention goals in all three categories since 1981. 
   Some may believe these numbers are acceptable, but each and every percentage loss hurts the war-fighting skills and readiness across the board for the Air Force. 
   For the Navy, we only have to look at the recent examples of the USS Enterprise. While deployed in the gulf, the USS Enterprise was short nearly 600 sailors. 
   I look again to another chart where we talk about the Navy 1998 officer retention rates: surface warfare officers retention, only 25 percent, against a steady state need of 38 percent. Like the Air Force, the Navy aviator retention was 39 percent in 1997 and further dropped to 32 percent in 1998, which falls short of the 35-percent level required to fill critical department head and flight leader positions. Submarine officers had a 27-percent retention rate, which is far short of the 38 percent needed in fiscal year 2001 in order to meet the stated manning requirements. For the vaunted SEAL forces, their rates have fallen to a dismal 58 percent from a historical level of over 80 percent. 
   The only good news comes from the Army and the Marines. These branches have met their retention goals but have said that they are having major problems in critical war-fighting skill areas which must be addressed to stay at current readiness. 
   All of these numbers are not to glaze people's eyes over but to open some eyes to the problems our military is facing. These retention problems are real and must be addressed. Inadequate retention only heightens the problems of longer deployments, increased frequency of deployment, and longer work hours due to less personnel. 
   This not only places our military in precarious and dangerous situations, but places great stress on their families and loved ones.

   Mr. ALLARD. Madam President, if you look at this chart we see the problems the services are having in recruiting. This is the fourth chart on the floor that I have provided. 
   In 1998 the Army fell almost 800 recruits short of their goal, and are over 2,000 recruits short of their first quarter goal. 
   If we look at the Air Force, the Air Force's 1998 number was 600 recruits short of their goal and over 400 recruits short in the first quarter. 
   Also, for the first time ever the Air Force will advertise on television to increase their lagging numbers. 
   The Navy's 1998 shortfall was 6,892 recruits. While it met its first quarter, they had to raise their high school dropout rate acceptance from 5 percent to 10 percent. 
   These are troubling numbers and these numbers are one of the reasons why the Personnel Subcommittee, which I chair--my good friend, Senator CLELAND, is the ranking member--has called for its first hearing to focus on recruitment and retention problems. We cannot allow our armed services to become hollow due to the lack of personnel. The best way to ensure that we recruit and retain the best and brightest is to pay them the wages they deserve and provide the benefits to keep them. 
   While S. 4 does not directly address recruitment, it does make changes which we believe will assist our military recruiters. Beyond the pay raise incentives, the bill enhances the Montgomery GI bill benefits. S. 4 will eliminate the $1,200 contribution required of members who elect to participate in the GI bill, increase monthly GI bill benefits anywhere between $60 to $70, allow service members to transfer education benefits to immediate family members, and then to accelerate lump-sum benefits for an entire term, semester, or quarter at college, and full amounts for courses not leading to a college degree. 
   The Armed Services Committee believes that these enhancements will make entering the military more attractive to more people, especially when the private sector offers so many more options than in the past. 
   I will conclude with a few personal thoughts. I understand that this bill is not acceptable to all Senators, but if you plan on voting no, I ask that you think about a few people--the young service man or woman who is about to be sent to Kosovo, or the service member who is coming back from Bosnia, or even second tour of Bosnia; or about the pilot patrolling the no-fly zone in Iraq; or the sailor who is doing double duty because his ship is undermanned and so he will have to be away from his family longer than necessary. How will you tell them that they are not worth the extra money in S. 4? 
   Let me finish with a statement from a letter which I believe was printed in the National Association of Uniformed Services Journal and reprinted in the Northern Colorado chapter of the Retired Officers Association's newsletter, entitled, ``Why Am I Getting Out?''  
   The bottom line is ``Patriotism is great, but it doesn't put food on the table or provide for your family.'' One soldier who requires food stamps is a shame. We can do better for those from whom we ask so much.  
   Madam President, I yield the floor. 
   Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. ALLARD. As we all know, this impeachment trial has been a difficult process for the Senate and for our nation. 
   As this trial draws to a close of each of us has the solemn duty of voting our conscience according to the dictates of the Constitution. I do not take this responsibility lightly. 
   For me, the vote in this trial will be the second most important of my Congressional career. The only other vote to rank higher was my vote to authorize the Gulf War and thereby send American soldiers into combat. 
   My ultimate goal as we moved into this process was to maintain precedent and not shatter a very thoughtful process laid out in the Constitution and within Senate rules.  
   At the start of this Senate impeachment trial I took an oath to do impartial justice according to the Constitution and laws. I worked hard to adhere to that oath, and I pray that I have kept that oath. 
   This is particularly important to me since much of my thinking in this case centers on my conclusion that the President has violated his oath of office. 
   I have determined to base my decision on the facts of the case, not the polls, the performance of the economy, the President's popularity or where he is in his term of office. 
   Finally, I have felt that if any of the parts of an article constitute grounds for impeachment, then an affirmative vote on the article is warranted. 
   While the Senate is clearly divided on conviction and removal, one thing we have all learned is the importance of the Constitution. 
   We may be separated by political party or ideology, but we are united in our belief in the Constitution as the governing charter of our republic. 
   Presidents come and go, and Senators come and go. The Constitution remains. It is the foundation of our political system. 
   The Constitution is what preserves the rule of law, and guarantees that we remain a nation of laws, not of men. 
   And, as we have all learned, in the impeachment and trial of a President, the Constitution is the document that directs how we shall proceed as members of the Congress. 
   Some have argued that this trial has divided America. In the short run, yes. But in the long run, it has united us and made us stronger. 
   We are stronger because we have once again demonstrated that we determine who shall lead this nation by democratic means, not by force of arms. 
   During the past month, I have listened to the evidence and I have weighed it carefully. It is now time for me to cast my vote and to explain my reasoning to my colleagues and to my constituents. 
   We have before us two articles of Impeachment. The first deals with perjury, the second with obstruction of justice. 
   The first article alleges that the President violated his Constitutional oath and his August 17, 1998 sworn oath to tell the truth before a federal grand jury. 
   He did so by willfully providing perjurious, false and misleading testimony in one or more of the following: (1) the nature and details of his relationship with a subordinate government employee; (2) prior perjurious, false and misleading testimony he gave in a Federal civil rights action brought against him; (3) prior false and misleading statements he allowed his attorney to make to a Federal judge in that civil rights action; and (4) his corrupt efforts to influence the testimony of witnesses and to impede the discovery of evidence in that civil rights action. 
   In my view the House managers demonstrated that at least three of the four provisions are true. The physical evidence is there, and the testimony supports that position. 
   I realize that with enough lawyers, one can certainly cloud things, and confuse and distract, but I believe the facts speak for themselves. 
   To me, once you cut through all the legal details and hours and hours of argument, this case is very clear. The President lied under oath. He lied not once, but repeatedly. 
   On this article, the only question for me is whether it rises to the level of an impeachable offense. I believe that it does. And this has certainly been the prior view of the Senate since it has on several occasions convicted and removed Federal judges for perjury. 
   Most recently in 1989, when Federal District Judge Nixon was convicted and removed from office for ``knowingly and contrary to his oath mak[ing] a material false or misleading statement to a grand jury.'' 
   Here the judge's violation of the oath ``to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth'' was deemed an impeachable offense. I simply cannot justify a different standard for the President. 
   Some have argued that the standard for him should be lower because he is elected by the people, while federal judges are appointed by the President and confirmed by the U.S. Senate to serve for life. While I respect those who hold this view, I cannot agree with it. 
   I hold the President to a higher standard because he is the chief law enforcement official of the nation. If he is above the law, then we have a double standard; one for the powerful, and one for the rest. 
   Now let me address the second article. The charge is that the President violated his Constitutional oath in that he prevented, obstructed, and impeded the administration of justice. 
   Obstruction of justice is clearly an impeachable offense. History and prior practice support this view, and it seems that many members of this body agree that obstruction does warrant removal from office. 
   The question then is whether the House managers have demonstrated obstruction of justice. I believe that they have. 
   When we review the witness depositions of Monica Lewinsky, Vernon Jordan, and Sidney Blumenthal, we compare those with the depositions of the President, and when we review all the evidence gathered and presented by the House managers, and by the independent counsel and the grand jury, there are at least four areas of obstruction by the President. 
   These relate to the encouraging of a false affidavit, the concealment of gifts, the assistance in employment, and the attempt to refresh the memory of his Secretary Betty Currie which done a second time several days later is pure and simple trying to influence her testimony. 
   While we may never know with absolute certainty what occurred, the evidence is overwhelming that the President took numerous actions designed to impede the administration of justice. 
   I am also of the view that if the President committed perjury, then he obstructed justice. Perjury is a form of obstruction of justice. 
   I will therefore vote for conviction on both articles. I don't believe I will be voting to undo an election. We have a process of succession to the Presidency which maintains control in the Vice President of the same party with the same agenda. 
   Let me now explain why I feel conviction is so important in this case. It has to do with the roll of the oath in our society. This is why the President's removal is necessary to protect the republic. 
   When I was sworn in as a United States Senator I took the following oath to uphold the Constitution as did each one of you:  
   I do solemnly swear that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic; that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same; that I take this obligation freely, without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion, and that I will well and faithfully discharge the duties of the office on which I am about to enter. So help me God.  
   I took the same oath on three occasions when I served in the U.S. House of Representatives. The President takes a similar oath when he enters office:  
   I do solemnly swear that I will faithfully execute the Office of President of the United States, and will to the best of my ability, preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States.  
   Both of these oaths are required by the Constitution. 
   Article VI of the Constitution requires that all Senators, Representatives, Members of the State Legislatures, and all executive and judicial Officers of the United States and the States shall be bound by oath or affirmation to support the Constitution. The oath of office lies at the center of this impeachment debate. 
   As George Washington stated in his Second Inaugural Address on March 4, 1793:  
   Previous to the execution of any official act of the President the Constitution requires an oath of office. This oath I am now about to take, and in your presence: That if it shall be found during my administration of the Government I have in any instance violated willingly or knowingly the injunctions thereof, I may (besides incurring constitutional punishment) be subject to the upbraidings of all who are now witnesses of the present solemn ceremony.  
   The sworn oath is central not only to our Constitution, but also to the administration of justice. Our legal system would not function without it. 
   Witnesses in trials swear under oath to ``tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth.''  
   Similarly, parties in civil lawsuits answer written questions or ``interrogatories'' put to them by their opponents. All answers are given under penalty of perjury. The answering party must sign a statement attesting to the truthfulness of the answers. 
   Testimony before a federal grand jury is given under oath, with the witness swearing to ``tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth.'' And the citizens who sit on a grand jury take an oath to seek the truth. 
   The Federal Rules of Evidence make reference to the importance of the oath in our judicial system. 
   Rule 603 states that the oath is ``calculated to awaken the witness' conscience and impress the witness' mind with the duty'' to tell the truth. 
   The Supreme Court has commented in a number of cases on the question of perjury. In the 1975 case of United States v. Mandujano the Court opinion noted:  
   In this constitutional process of securing a witness' testimony, perjury simply has no place whatever. Perjured testimony is an obvious and flagrant affront to the basic concepts of judicial proceedings. Effective restraints against this type of egregious offense are therefore imperative.  
   In the much earlier 1937 case of United States v. Norris the Court observed:  
   There is occasional misunderstanding to the effect that perjury is somehow distinct from ``obstruction of justice.'' While the crimes are distinct, they are in fact variations on a single theme: preventing a court, the parties, and the public from discovering the truth. Perjury, subornation of perjury, concealment of subpoenaed documents, and witness tampering are all forms of obstruction of justice.  
   As the House prosecutors have argued, the principle of ``Equal Justice Under Law'' is at the very heart of our legal system. 
   In order to survive it requires not only an impartial judiciary and an ethical bar, but also a sacred oath. Without the sanctity of the oath, ``Equal Justice Under Law'' cannot be guaranteed. 
   In addition to our legal system, other sectors of our society rely on oaths to ensure truthfulness and uphold values.

    Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, last year I rose to offer a Mile High Salute to the Denver Broncos for winning their first world championship. It gives me great pleasure to rise again today and offer a ``Repeat Mile High Salute'' to Colorado's repeat Super Bowl champions. On Sunday the Denver Broncos won their second world championship in two years in Super Bowl Thirty-Three by beating Coach Dan Reeves and the Atlanta Falcons. 
   The Broncos thrilling win came after the finest regular season in club history. Coach Mike Shanahan guided the Broncos to a thirteen game winning streak to start the season and an overall 19-2 record. Hall of Fame bound icon John Elway became only the second quarterback ever to throw for over 50,000 yards and he stands today as the winningest quarterback in NFL history with 148 regular season wins. Running back Terrell Davis became only the fourth player in NFL history to run for more than 2,000 yards and his season ranks as the third best ever for his position. Even place kicker Jason Elam kicked his way into the record books with a record tying 63 yard field goal earlier this year. 
   The Denver receiving corps is among the finest in football, featuring the sure-handed and hard blocking Ed McCaffrey and Rod Smith who each caught for over 1,000 yards this season. And no one will be able to forget the verbose Shannon Sharpe who became the first tight-end in history to record 7 straight fifty catch seasons. The Broncos will send an American Football Conference record 10 players to the Pro Bowl in Hawaii. John Elway, Terrell Davis, Ed McCaffrey, Shannon Sharpe, Steve Atwater, Bill Romanowski, Tom Nalen, Mark Schlereth, Tony Jones and Jason Elam each made the trip to Hawaii. 
   The Denver offensive line, while quiet and unassuming off the field, dominates the line of scrimmage every week. 
   The well-balanced offense has been complimented by an equally well-balanced defense. Led this season by leading tackler Bill Romanowski and veterans Ray Crockett, Steve Atwater, Neil Smith, Maa Tanuvasa and Keith Traylor. The Broncos defense has improved every step of the way through the regular season and playoffs. 
   The Broncos defense was as equally team oriented in their Super Bowl efforts. Their 30 tackles were distributed among twelve players. Darrien Gordon and Darrius Johnson combined for three interceptions and linebackers John Mobley and Bill Romanowski each recorded a sack on Atlanta quarterback Chris Chandler. 
   What makes the Broncos special, though, is that all of their individual accomplishments highlight fine team play from each and every player. When you look at the Super Bowl, Mr. President, you can see that this championship was truly a team effort. 
   The Broncos offense totaled 457 yards. Terrell Davis rushed for 102 yards, while John Elway connected with six different receivers for 336 yards. Rod Smith led all receivers with 152 yards, including a key 80 yard reception that broke the game open in the second quarter. At the conclusion of the game, and perhaps at the close of his amazing sixteen year career, John Elway was named Most Valuable Player of the Super Bowl. 
   While nothing will compare to the excitement of last year's win, I know I speak for all Coloradans when I say that we are proud to be the home of the back to back world champion Denver Broncos.

    Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation to help protect the financial privacy of Americans. The so-called Know Your Customer regulations proposed by Federal banking agencies threaten the privacy of our financial transactions. My bill would ensure that those regulations are not enacted, and that Americans can be confident in the privacy of their bank account. 
   Governmental overregulation has invaded nearly every aspect of our lives, often at the cost of our privacy. Technology has the potential to accelerate the invasion of our privacy. 
   The Know Your Customer regulations have been proposed by the four banking regulators: the Federal Reserve, the FDIC, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, and the Office of Thrift Supervision. These regulations may force banks to snoop through customers' bank accounts under the guise of looking for ``suspicious activity.'' Banks would have to know the source of funds for all financial transactions. Specifically, the regulations would require banks to develop standards of normal and expected transactions for all accounts. The bank then would be required to monitor all account activity to see if it fits the normal and expected activity profile. If a financial transaction takes place that doesn't fit the model, the bank could be forced to file a suspicious activity report with a federal law enforcement agency, such as the FBI or DEA. 
   Imagine that you sell an old car and then go to the bank to deposit the money in your account. You explain that you simply sold your car and this is the money from the sale. However, you are informed that the explanation is insufficient. The deposit does not fit your usual and expected transaction profile, so you might be reported to law enforcement officials. You may now have to prove to the satisfaction of the FBI or other federal agency that you are not a drug dealer or money launderer. These proposed regulations could force you to prove your innocence before you have even been accused of a crime. 
   Unfortunately, this scenario is one that could be repeated many times over. Anytime someone receives a bonus at work, receives an inheritance, receives a large gift, sells a large item, or withdraws money to make a major purchase it could trigger a suspicious activity report and an investigation by law enforcement. The perverse effect of causing law enforcement officials to investigate so much mundane financial activity merely because it deviates from some profile of ``normal'' is that resources will be unavailable to combat genuine financial fraud. 
   Would all this happen? We don't know, but the extremely broad and vague wording of the draft regulations could certainly permit it to happen. 
   Furthermore, these regulations are unnecessary because banks already partner with law enforcement to fight financial crime without invading the privacy of customers. Banks currently report insider abuse, violations of federal law, and potential money laundering activity. But these 
   are after the fact. Banks are also required to report all cash transactions over $10,000. By contrast, the proposed regulations would force them to snoop through accounts to look for transactions to report, merely because they are deemed ``suspicious.'' Banks are then transformed from an agent monitoring regulatory compliance to an investigator and enforcer for the government. This creates a significant unfunded federal mandate for the banking industry. 
   Accordingly, the proposed regulations are opposed by major banking groups, including the American Bankers Association and the Independent Bankers Association of America. They fear a loss of privacy for their customers that would negatively impact their industry. In addition, these regulations are very selective-credit unions, securities firms, and insurance firms would not be subject to the proposed regulations. 
   Obviously, these proposed regulations could be detrimental to the millions of Americans who use a bank for their financial transactions. This legislation would prevent the Federal banking agencies involved from implementing the proposed Know Your Customer regulations. We must protect the financial privacy of Americans, and prevent the proposed regulations from being enacted.

   This Act became Public Law on October 19, 1996 thanks to the diligence and hard work of Senator Brown, my predecessor. The purpose of this Act is to designate the Cache La Poudre Corridor with the Cache La Poudre River Basin. The Poudre Corridor provides an educational and inspirational benefit to both present and future generations, as well as unique and significant contributions to our national heritage of cultural and historical lands, waterways, and structures within the Corridor. 
   It is important that the following technical corrections be made to ensure that this act is interpreted and implemented correctly.

   Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, today I am introducing a bill to amend the Animal Welfare Act to remove the limitation that permits interstate movement of live birds for the purpose of fighting to States in which animal fighting is lawful. 
   Currently, the Animal Welfare Act makes it unlawful for any person to knowingly sponsor or exhibit an animal in any animal fighting venture to which the animal was moved in interstate or foreign commerce. This means that if an animal crosses state lines and then fights in a state where cockfighting is not legal, that is a crime. However, the law further states, ``the activities prohibited by such subsections shall be unlawful with respect to fighting ventures involving live birds only if the fight is to take place in a State where it would be in violation of the laws thereof.'' This means that the law applies to all animals involved in all types of fighting--except for birds being transported for cockfighting purposes to a state where cockfighting is still legal. Because of the loophole, law enforcement officers have a more difficult time prosecuting under their state cockfighting bans. 
   As introduced this legislation will close the loophole on cockfighting, and prohibit interstate movement of birds for the purpose of fighting from states where cockfighting is illegal to states where cockfighting is legal. This legislation will clarify that possession of fighting birds in any of the 47 states would then be illegal, as shipping them out for cockfighting purposes would be illegal. 
   I believe that my colleague from states where cockfighting is illegal will benefit from this change because it will make law enforcement easier. I also believe that my colleagues from states or territories where cockfighting is currently legal should not oppose this change as it merely confines cockfighting to within that state's borders.

    Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the contributions of Lieutenant General Normand G. Lezy of the United States Air Force, who will retire on March 1st after more than three decades of outstanding service to our nation. Norm Lezy is an extraordinary officer whose leadership skills, professionalism and service before self are a tribute to our country's military. 
   General Lezy is a native of Rhode Island, and was commissioned into the Air Force in November 1964 through the Reserve Officer Training Corps program. Throughout his career, General Lezy has earned a well-deserved reputation as a leader who truly cares about people. Whether he was commanding his student training squadron, a Minuteman I combat missile launch crew, an air base squadron, a combat support group or working in his many key staff assignments, Norm Lezy made people his priority.  
   In addition to his many tours of duty around the world, General Lezy has served as Director of Administration and Information Management for the Secretary of the Air Force; the Deputy Chief of Staff for Personnel, Headquarters Pacific Air Force; and the Director of Services, Headquarters U.S. Air Force. Many here in the Senate first came to know Norm when he was the Director of Legislative Liaison for the Secretary of the Air Force. With his exceptional knowledge of all aspects of Air Force operations and his keen awareness of the legislative process, General Lezy dramatically improved communication between the United States Congress and the United States Air Force. He was the driving force in gaining Congressional support for critical Air Force programs such as the C-17, B-2, and F-22 weapon systems, all of which will have a significant impact on the future of the United States Air Force and the security of our nation. 
   In his most recent assignment as the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense (Military Personnel Policy), General Lezy was directly responsible for the establishment of all policies concerning military personnel matters. Specifically, he focused on accessing and retaining military personnel in all services; pay, compensation and benefits; and the classification, assignment, and career development for the 1.4 million service members of the Department of Defense. True to his reputation, General Lezy fought for increased support for service members and worked to develop personnel policies that will successfully guide our armed forces well into the next century. Some of the more significant efforts he undertook include conducting a complete review of the military pay and retirement system, improving recruiting policies and advertising programs, enhancing Professional Military Education, and streamlining the Department of Defense Disability Evaluation System. 
   Throughout his distinguished career, General Lezy's tireless and sincere dedication to the men and women in uniform has vastly improved their quality of life and mission readiness. As General Norm Lezy retires from the United States Air Force, he will leave behind a tremendous legacy. 
   Mr. President, General Norm Lezy is a great credit to the Air Force and the Nation. He will certainly be missed by many, both in the Pentagon and in Congress. I salute him for his many years of selfless service to our country, and offer my gratitude to Norm, his wife Prudence, and their son Chip on the occasion of his retirement from the United States Air Force.

   Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, today I introduce legislation to repeal the ``temporary'' 0.2 percent Federal Unemployment Tax (FUTA) surtax. 
   The ``temporary'' surtax was enacted in 1976 by Congress to repay the general fund of the Treasury for funds borrowed by the unemployment trust fund. Although the borrowings were repaid in 1987, Congress has continued to extend the surtax in tax bill after tax bill. 
   Since 1987, Congress has used extension of the surtax to help raise revenue to pay for tax packages. In fact, the surtax was most recently extended to help pay for the 1997 tax bill. The tax takes money out of the private economy for no valid reason. 
   By repealing the surtax, Congress will honor a promise that it made when the surtax was first enacted. Small businesses were told repeatedly that the tax was temporary and would be repealed when it was no longer needed to finance the unemployment tax system. Clearly a tax is not temporary when it has already been in place for over twenty years. I would suggest at a minimum that if we are going to keep extending this tax, that we be honest with the American worker and small business owner and stop calling this tax ``temporary.'' 
   Based on the original purpose, the surtax is no longer needed. The economy is experiencing the highest level of employment in decades, and all state unemployment funds have surpluses. It is inappropriate for the government to continue to raise excess unemployment taxes and then use the surplus for purposes completely unrelated to unemployment. 
   Repeal of the temporary unemployment surtax will also be beneficial to small businesses. The surtax is especially hard on the small businesses because they are often labor intensive. Any payroll tax is added directly to the employer's payroll costs. In fact, according to the National Federation of Independent Business, payroll taxes are the fastest growing federal tax burden on small business. It is also important to note that the payroll taxes must be paid whether the business experiences a profit or a loss. 
   As a former small businessman myself, I am particularly aware of this fact. I suspect that my view is similar to the view of many small business owners. It is one thing to have a surtax when unemployment is high and the surtax is necessary. However, it is totally unjustified when unemployment is at the lowest level in three decades. 
   Repeal of the 0.2 percent surtax will reduce the tax burden on employers and workers by $6 billion over the next five years. 
   Lower payroll taxes mean higher wages for workers. Although the employer appears to fully pay for the unemployment surtax and other payroll taxes, the economic evidence is strong that the cost is actually passed to workers in the form of lower wages. 
   Consistent tax relief will help to ensure that our economy remains the strongest and most vibrant in the world. Low taxes reduce unemployment and help ensure that future surtaxes are unnecessary.
