   Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I am pleased to rise today with Senators GRAMM, HARKIN, FITZGERALD, HAGEL, and JOHNSON to re-introduce the Commodity Futures Modernization Act of 2000. This legislation is the Senate companion to H.R. 5660, which Congressman THOMAS EWING introduced yesterday in the House of Representatives and which will be enacted as part of the final appropriations package today. This monumental legislation is the culmination of two years worth of hearings and hard-fought negotiations, but I am confident that the resulting legislation will greatly benefit the U.S. financial industry. I commend all the Members and staff who have contributed to this bill. In particular, I want to applaud Senator GRAMM, Congressman EWING and Senator FITZGERALD for their stewardship and determination in helping pass a bill this year. Its enactment would not have occurred without their efforts. I also want to recognize Treasury Secretary Summers, Commodity Futures Trading Commission, CFTC, Chairman Bill Rainer and Securities and Exchange Commission, SEC, Chairman Arthur Levitt as well as their staffs, who have played a pivotal role in bringing this bill together and garnering support for its passage. 
   This bill, which re-authorizes the Commodity Exchange Act for five  years, would reform our financial and derivatives laws in five primary ways. First, it would incorporate the unanimous recommendations of the President's Working Group on Financial Markets on the proper legal and regulatory treatment of over-the-counter, OTC, derivatives. Second, it would codify the regulatory relief proposal of the CFTC to ensure that futures exchanges are appropriately regulated and remain competitive. Third, this legislation would repeal the Shad-Johnson jurisdictional accord, which banned single stock futures 18 years ago. Fourth, this legislation provides certainty that products offered by banking institutions will not be regulated as futures contracts. Finally, this bill provides legal certainty for institutional equity swaps by providing the SEC with express but limited authorities over these instruments. 
   Derivative instruments, both those that are exchange-traded and traded over-the-counter, have played a significant role in our economy's current expansion due to their innovative nature and risk-transferring attributes. The global derivatives market has a notional value that now exceeds $90 trillion. Identified by Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan as the most significant event in finance of the past decade, the development of the derivatives market has substantially added to the productivity and wealth of our nation. 
   Derivatives enable companies to unbundle and transfer risk to those entities who are willing and able to accept it. By doing so, efficiency is enhanced as firms are able to concentrate on their core business objective. A farmer can purchase a futures contract, one type of derivative, in order to lock in a price for his crop at harvest. Likewise, automobile manufacturers whose profits earned overseas can fluctuate with changes in currency values, can minimize this uncertainty through derivatives, allowing them to focus on the business of building cars. Banks significantly lessen their exposure to interest rate movements by entering into derivatives contracts known as swaps, which enable these institutions to hedge their risk by exchanging variable and fixed rates of interests. 
   Signed into law in 1974, the Commodity Exchange Act, CEA, requires that futures contracts be traded on a regulated exchange. As a result, a futures contract that is traded off an exchange is illegal and unenforceable. When Congress enacted the CEA and authorized the CFTC to enforce it, this was not a concern. The meanings of ``futures'' and ``exchange'' were relatively apparent. Furthermore, the over-the-counter derivatives business was in its infancy. However, in 
   the 26 years since the statute's enactment, the OTC swaps and derivatives market, sparked by innovation and technology, has significantly outpaced the exchange-traded futures markets. Thus the definitions of a swap and a future began to blur. 
   In 1998, the CFTC issued a document containing a concept release regarding OTC derivatives, which was perceived by many as a precursor to regulating these instruments as futures. Just the threat of reaching this conclusion could have had considerable ramifications, given the size and importance of the OTC market. The legal uncertainty interjected by this dispute jeopardized the entirety of the OTC market and threatened to move significant portions of the business overseas. If we were to lose this market, most likely to London, it would take years to bring it back to U.S. soil. The resulting loss of business and jobs would be immeasurable. 
   This threat led the Treasury Department, the Federal Reserve, and the SEC to oppose the concept release and request that Congress enact a moratorium on the CFTC's ability to regulate these instruments until after the President's Working Group could complete a study on the issue. As a result, Congress passed a six-month moratorium on the CFTC's ability to regulate over-the-counter derivatives. Despite reservations, I supported this moratorium because it brought legal assurance to this skittish market and it allowed the Working Group time to develop recommendations on the most appropriate legal treatment of OTC derivatives. In November 1999, the President's Working Group completed its unanimous recommendations on OTC derivatives and presented Congress with these findings. These recommendations remain the cornerstone of our bill. 
   Our bill contains several mechanisms for ensuring that legal certainty is attained and that certain transactions remain outside the Commodity Exchange Act. The first, the electronic trading facility exclusion, would exclude transactions in financial commodities from the Act if conducted: (1) on a principal to principal basis; (2) between institutions or sophisticated persons with high net worth; and (3) on an electronic trading facility. The second would exclude these transactions if (1) they are conducted between institutions or sophisticated persons with high net worth; and (2) they are not on a trading facility. 
   These exclusions attempt to address the advent of electronic trading and the changing and innovating nature of the financial industry. Indeed, we are keenly aware that there are newly emerging electronic systems that provide for the electronic negotiation of swaps agreements between and among large banks and other sophisticated major financial institutions acting as dealers. We do not intend for these systems to come within the definition of trading facilities. 
   The third exclusion clarifies the Treasury Amendment language already contained in the CEA. It would exclude all transactions in foreign currency and government securities from the Act unless those transactions are futures contracts and traded on an organized exchange. As recommended by the Working Group, the bill would give the CFTC jurisdiction over non-regulated off-exchange retail transactions in foreign currency. Another important recommendation of the PWG was to authorize futures clearing facilities to clear OTC derivatives in an effort to lessen systemic risk and this bill incorporates this finding. 
   As part of the legal certainty provisions, this legislation also addresses the concern that excluding OTC derivatives from the futures laws will cause these products to be fully regulated as securities. With Senator GRAMM's leadership, this legislation adopts language that would provide the SEC with limited authority over institutional swaps for fraud, manipulation and 
   insider trading. This language will help to provide the legal certainty that these institutional transactions lack under current law. 
   Title four of this bill also provides legal certainty for banking products. Senator GRAMM has appropriately raised the concern that traditional banking products should not be subject to the CEA. This language provides an exclusion for traditional banking products as well as hybrid products that are predominantly banking in nature. New products offered by banks that are not in existence on December 5, 2000, or are otherwise not excluded from the CEA would fall under a ``jump ball'' provision of the bill. This section provides a mechanism for the CFTC and the Federal Reserve to determine whether a new non-traditional product offered by a bank should be regulated under the banking laws or the futures laws. 
   The second major section of this legislation addresses regulatory relief. In February of this year, the CFTC issued a regulatory relief proposal that would provide relief to futures exchanges and their customers. Instead of listing specific requirements for complying with the CEA, the proposal would require exchanges to meet internationally agreed-upon core principals. The CFTC proposal creates tiers of regulation for exchanges based on whether the underlying commodities being traded are susceptible to manipulation or whether the users of the exchange are limited to institutional customers. Unsure of whether this legislation would be enacted, the CFTC went ahead and finalized its regulatory relief proposal on November 20, 2000. 
   When enacted, this legislation will largely incorporate the CFTC's framework. A board of trade that is designated as a contract market would receive the highest level of regulation due to the fact that these products are susceptible to manipulation or are offered to retail customers. Futures on agricultural commodities would fall into this category. This bill also sets out that in lieu of contract market designation, a board of trade may register as a Derivatives Transaction Execution  Facility, DTEF, if the products being offered are not susceptible to manipulation and are traded among institutional customers or retail customers who use large Futures Commission Merchants, FCMs, who are members of a clearing facility. 
   Also, a board of trade may choose to be an Exempt Board of Trade, XBOT, and not be subject to the Act (except for the CFTC's anti-manipulation authority) if the products being offered are traded among institutional customers only (absolutely no retail) and the instruments are not susceptible to manipulation. Our bill would allow a board of trade that is a DTEF or an XBOT to opt to trade derivatives that are otherwise excluded from the Act on these facilities and to the extent that these products are traded on these facilities, the CFTC would have exclusive jurisdiction over them. With this provision, the intent is to provide these facilities that trade derivatives with a choice--if regulation is beneficial, the facility may choose to be regulated. If not, the facility may choose to be excluded or exempted from the Act. 
   By refraining from altering certain sections of the Act, this legislation re-affirms the importance of specific authorities granted the CFTC, including its anti-fraud and anti-manipulation powers. Section 4b is the principal anti-fraud provision of the Act and the Commission has consistently used Section 4b to combat fraudulent conduct by bucket shops and boiler rooms that entered into transactions directly with their customers and thus did not involve a traditional broker-client type of relationship. There have been cases involving the fraudulent sale of illegal precious metals futures contracts marketed as cash-forward transactions (CFTC v. P.I.E., Inc., 853 F.2d 721 (9th Cir. 1988)) as well as cases involving boiler room operations fraudulently selling illegal precious metals contracts to members of the general public. (CFTC v. Wellington Precious Metals, Inc., 950 F.2d 1525 (11th Cir.), cert. denied, 113 S. Ct. 66 (1992)). 
   This reaffirmation is consistent with both Congress' understanding of and past Congressional amendments to Section 4b that confirmed the applicability of Section 4b to fraudulent boiler rooms and bucket shops that enter into transactions directly with their customers. 
   It is the intent of Congress in retaining Section 4b of the Act that the provision not be limited to fiduciary, broker/customer or other agency-like relationships. Section 4b provides the Commission with broad authority to police fraudulent conduct within its jurisdiction, whether occurring in boiler rooms and bucket shops, or in the e-commerce markets that will develop under this new statutory framework. 
   The bill's last section addresses the Shad-Johnson jurisdictional accord. In 1982, SEC Chairman John Shad and CFTC Chairman Phil Johnson reached an agreement on dividing jurisdiction between the agencies for those products that had characteristics of both securities and futures. Known as the Shad-Johnson Accord, this agreement prohibited single stock futures and delineated jurisdiction between the SEC and the CFTC on stock index futures. 
   Meant as a temporary agreement, many have suggested that the Shad-Johnson accord should be repealed. The President's Working Group unanimously agreed that the Accord should be repealed if regulatory disparities are resolved between the regulation of futures and securities. In March 2000, the General Accounting Office released a report that found that there is no legitimate policy reason for maintaining the ban on single stock futures since these products are being traded in foreign markets, in the OTC market, and synthetically in the options markets. Chairman GRAMM and I sent a letter requesting the CFTC and the SEC to make recommendations on reforming the Shad-Johnson ban. On September 14, 2000, the SEC and CFTC reached an agreement on the proper regulatory treatment of these instruments, and we have incorporated this agreement into our legislation. 
   Under the legislation, the SEC and the CFTC would jointly regulate the market for single stock futures and narrow-based stock index futures. These products will be allowed to trade on both futures and securities exchanges. Single stock futures and narrow-based stock index futures (i.e., security futures) would be statutorily defined as both securities and futures, allowing the agencies the authority to regulate these instruments. However, to avoid redundancy, our legislation exempts these products from a series of regulations and requirements under both the securities and futures laws. 
   Margin levels, listing standards, and other key trading practices would be jointly supervised by the SEC and CFTC. At the outset, margin levels for security futures products could not be lower than comparable margin levels required in the options markets. The tax treatment of these products would be comparable to the tax treatment of options on securities to ensure a level playing field between the markets. 
   Futures on broad-based indices would be under the exclusive jurisdiction of the CFTC. The agreement sets out a ``bright-line'' formula for determining when an index is broad-based using the number and weighting of the securities contained in the index. This formula would allow a broad-based index to contain as few as 9 securities. 
   The goal of this legislation is to ensure that the United States remains a global leader in the derivatives marketplace and that these markets are appropriately and effectively regulated. I believe that this legislation meets these objectives while ensuring that the public's interest in the financial markets is protected. 
   This long legislative journey began two years ago when the Senate and House Agriculture Committees held a two day roundtable, in which distinguished individuals from the financial community participated. One of those individuals was Merton H. Miller, the Nobel Prize winning professor of economics from the University of Chicago, who passed away this summer. Professor Miller, known for his disarming sense of humor, his plain-spokenness and his generosity, is dearly missed by his family, friends and colleagues. The impact of his death has been particularly hard felt by the community of friends at the Chicago futures markets. Professor Miller was the primary intellectual force behind the development of the modern financial futures market and a staunch defender of the free market system. His body of work helped bring academic legitimacy to these markets, and he is sorely missed by them. As part of our roundtable discussion, we allowed each of the participants to make one wish for the coming 106th Congress. True to his life's work in this area, Professor Miller told us that Congress needed to lessen the cost of regulation on the futures and other financial markets in order to allow these markets to survive and compete in the global economy. I find it particularly satisfying that we are able to pass this historic legislation at the end of the 106th Congress and provide Professor Miller with his wish. I am confident that his legacy will live on through the success and growth of the markets that are benefitted by this legislation.

   Mr. LUGAR. Yes. As with any of options for rehabilitation, the local sponsor can reject NRCS' offer to provide cost-share for a particular project. also, NRCS is never required to fund a project that it believes is not justified.

   Mr. LUGAR. Yes. Although the bill is silent on cost-benefit analysis, it is expected that NRCS will follow its normal procedures including following the ``Economic and Environmental Principles and Guidelines for Water and Related Land Resources Implementation Studies.'' As part of being fiscally and environmentally responsible, NRCS should look for the most cost-effective solution with the best feasible environmental results. Further, NRCS should not fund a project if the local sponsor insists on a form of rehabilitation that does not meet these standards.

   Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, section 804 of H.R. 4461, the conference report on the fiscal year 2001 agriculture appropriations bill, provides the Secretary of Agriculture with emergency authority to compensate growers for crop losses due to new and emergent pests and diseases, including watermelon sudden wilt disease. 
   Senator COCHRAN, I want to thank you for including watermelon sudden wilt disease in the list of problems addressed by section 804. This disease, which is characterized by wilting leaves and collapsing vines, often results in the death of mature watermelon plants. The disease became a problem in southwestern Indiana last year and has become a much more serious problem in the region this year. Last year, Indiana farmers grew $11 million worth of watermelons, ranking sixth in the nation. This year production will likely be significantly less. On September 19, 2000 USDA's Farm Service Agency office in Indianapolis estimated that the disease may be responsible for Indiana watermelon losses of up to $4.7 million. 
   Despite ongoing study, scientists at Purdue University have not yet determined what causes the disease, including whether or not adverse weather is a contributing factor. As a result, it appears unlikely that Hoosier watermelon growers affected by this problem will be eligible for assistance under USDA's existing disaster programs or for assistance provided by other sections of the agriculture appropriations conference report. Assistance in these cases is generally limited to weather-related crop losses. As a result, full implementation by the Secretary of Agriculture of the emergency compensation authority provided by section 804 is important. 
   I must note, however, that section 804 permits, but does not require, the Secretary of Agriculture to provide compensation to growers due to watermelon sudden wilt disease and other new and emergent pests and diseases. Is it the intent of the bill's managers that the Secretary of Agriculture fully implement the authority provided by section 804?

   Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to join me in commemorating the 225th birthday to the United States Navy, by passing Senate Resolution 373. Several of the Senate's other veterans of naval service have joined me in sponsoring this resolution and I thank Senator MCCAIN, Senator MOYNIHAN, Senator WARNER, Senator COCHRAN, Senator ROBB, Senator BOB SMITH, Senator MILLER, Senator BOB KERREY and Senator JOHN KERRY. 
   While we like to celebrate on a birthday, we must pause in solemn reflection, for yesterday, the Navy family suffered a tragic loss. I send my heartfelt condolences to the U.S.S. Cole and her extended family. Like thousands of Sailors before them, these brave men and women have made the ultimate sacrifice in service to their country. The loss is felt by the entire nation, and the entire nation grieves with you and expresses gratitude for your sacrifice. 
   October 13, 1775, was the day that the Continental Congress established a ``Naval Committee'' to acquire and fit out vessels for sea and draw up regulations. By the following month the committee procured two ships, two brigs and later two sloops and two schooners. From these modest beginnings, the greatest Navy in the world has grown. Down through the years, the Navy has been central to the history of this nation, and ever-integral to her longevity and prosperity. 
   Mr. President, I had the honor of serving in the Navy. Perhaps my greatest honor during my service as a young naval intelligence officer was working for Admiral Arleigh ``31-Knot'' Burke, when he was Chief of Naval Operations. A heroic WWII destroyer squadron commander, Admiral Burke was truly a man of vision. Under his tutelage I learned valuable lessons about the Navy's place in our history, but also about the key role it plays today in economics, science, politics, and international relations. Then as now, the world was an uncertain place, and the Navy played a vital role in calming the waters. 
   Admiral Burke is the namesake for the class of destroyers to which the U.S.S. Cole belongs. The Cole tragedy brings the spotlight on the Navy and the day-in, day-out honor, courage and commitment of her sailors. At the commissioning of the lead ship in the class, Admiral Burke stated fittingly ``This ship is built to fight, you had better know how.'' A quote reminiscent of Captain John Paul Jones legendary declaration: ``I wish to have no connection with any ship that does not sail fast, for I intend to go in harm's way.'' These are the best ships in the world, manned by the world's best Sailors, but they are not impregnable fortresses, they do sail in harm's way. 
   Many have expressed incredulity at the attack on the warship Cole. But, she was in a vulnerable situation--coming pierside to replenish fuel in a presumed-benign environment. The task that was to occupy Cole and her crew over the next several months--maritime interdiction duty in the Persian Gulf--was more precarious. Ships refuel in foreign ports daily as they have for many years. But this tragedy is a reminder that the peace and prosperity we enjoy is not without cost, nor are the commitments we make to our allies.

   Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I rise to introduce a resolution in support of democracy and drug eradication in Bolivia. I'm pleased that I have been joined by several colleagues in a bipartisan initiative to applaud and support one of the most successful drug-eradication programs in the world. 
   Our resolution recognizes that extraordinary achievements of Bolivia's narcotics elimination program. It urges the Government of Bolivia to continue its program of drug elimination while upholding the rule of law and safeguarding human rights. It also urges the indigenous leaders to cease provocative acts and begin discussions with the Government of Bolivia to resolve outstanding issues. 
   For nearly two weeks now, Bolivia has been confronting one of the worst social upheavals the country has endured in the past two decades. The turmoil has been perpetrated by diverse forces in Bolivia, particularly those who wish to reverse the drug eradication program in the country. 
   A destabilization campaign, initiated by drug traffickers, has resulted in a number of protests that have virtually paralyzed the country. Roads that connect the major cities of the country were destroyed and blockaded and the flow of food to the urban centers has been interrupted. Nearly a dozen people have died and more have been injured by acts of violence. Economic losses are estimated at more than $160 million and growing. 
   The protesters, who are led by coca growers, were demanding the resignation of the President, the suspension of the anti-drug strategy, and the elimination of plans to build a U.S. funded military installation in the Chapare region--the region where most illegal coca has been cultivated. They also demand that the Government allow peasants of the Chapare to replant about 6,000 hectares of coca, which, if that is allowed to happen, would yield roughly 42 tons of cocaine. 
   President Banzer has flatly rejected most demands to changes in the Bolivian drug strategy, the Dignity Plan. He has, nevertheless, agreed to suspend plans for the construction of a new military installation in the Chapare and proposed to refurbish the existing installation instead. 
   Other groups in Bolivia have added a number of unrelated demands which appeared to be coordinated by or to be in concert with the coca leaders. Teachers, for example, have demanded pay raises, inmates have asked for better jail conditions, peasants demanded a modification of laws on land ownership, doctors requested better pay, and agitators exploited the current state of affairs to amplify racial division. Isolated by themselves, these may be reasonable requests but when they are raised or orchestrated by drug traffickers, the goals become more malevolent.  
   The protesters formed a coordinated block with the intent to make the government deal with all the demands together, in the form of a comprehensive package. 
   There is little doubt that the largest risk for the country lies with the ``cocalero'' movement--the peasant coca growers--that is supported by regional drug trafficking interests. The drug traffickers are embarking on a desperate effort to reverse the anti-drug plan being waged by the Bolivian Government and turn back the remarkable progress in drug eradication that has been accomplished in the past few years. 
   Coca leaders and the drug traffickers are aware that their leadership and the ill-gotten riches they derive from illegal narcotics will end if the final 1,800 hectares of coca in the Chapare are destroyed. This helps explain the intransigence of its leaders. During this crisis, the government has demonstrated a steady dedication to seek agreements through dialogue while retaining a respect for human rights. 
   It is important to keep in mind that the current turmoil in Bolivia is occurring at a time when Bolivia is set to complete its program of coca eradication while simultaneously facing a serious economic crisis. Of the 40,000 hectares which have been used for the cultivation of coca, only 1,800 hectares remain. 
   The Bolivian economy have taken a big hit from its effort to combat drug trafficking. The fight against drug trafficking alone has resulted in the loss of 3% of Bolivia's GDP. The fight against contraband and customs reforms have absorbed another 3% of the GDP of Bolivia. This is all the more remarkable because this pan to eradicate drugs has taken place in a country where 7 out of 10 Bolivians live on $2 a day, an income which is very much below the poverty line. 
   For these and other reasons, the Government of Bolivia has called on the international community to do everything possible to ensure that the hard won efforts in the fight against drug trafficking are not turned back. 
   Mr. President, let me conclude by saying that our resolution congratulates the Government of Bolivia for its successful drug elimination program and urges the government to continue its commitment to eradicate illegal coca by the end of 2002. It applauds the government's efforts to pursue its anti-narcotics strategy and urges the government to do what it can to uphold the rule of law and democratic practices, despite the strains the drug traffickers have imposed on the government. The resolution also stresses the view that human rights must continue to be safeguarded and urges the indigenous leaders to terminate provocative acts and negotiate the outstanding issues with the government of Bolivia. 
   I urge our colleagues to take note of the successful drug eradication program in Bolivia and encourage the democratically-elected government in La Paz to sustain its commitment for total coca eradication by the end of next year.

   Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I rise to call attention to report language in the Senate version of the Commerce, Justice, and State, the Judiciary, and related agencies appropriations bill, which directs the National Endowment for Democracy (NED) to spend 20 percent of its budget on ``nation-building'' activities in four war-stricken areas. The language appears in the committee report. Although the language is not mandatory, it sends a strong message that compliance by NED is expected. I believe that the language should be deleted. 
   I would like to commend the work of the chairman and ranking member of the CJS Appropriations subcommittee, Senator GREGG and Senator HOLLINGS, for providing the NED with the resources to conduct its vital work. NED and its four core institutes do an exceptional job in assisting grassroots democrats in more than 80 countries around the world. NED has a strong track record, developed through involvement in virtually every critical struggle for democracy over the past fifteen years. NED supported the democratic movements that helped bring about peaceful transitions to democracy in Poland, the Czech Republic, Chile, and South Africa. NED is also playing an important role in supporting some of the newer democracies, such as Indonesia, Nigeria, Croatia, and Mexico. 
   I am very familiar with the work of NED and its institutes because I serve on NED's Board of Directors. I serve on the Board along with two other Senators and two Members of the House representing both political parties. We  are all concerned about the implications of the committee's report language on the operations and mission of the Endowment. 
   In its report, the committee recommends that NED spend 20 percent of its entire budget to reconstitute civil governments in four seriously troubled areas--Sierra Leone, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Kosovo, and East Timor. I am pleased to report that NED is working in each of these areas on long-term democratic development. The Endowment is helping non-governmental organizations, whose leaders are facing grave danger to their personal safety, as they report on human rights abuses, campaign for peace, and provide independent news and information to the public. 
   We need to keep in mind that NED's mission is not to ``build'' nations or governments, but to help promote democracy. It does this giving a helping hand to those inside other countries through financial and technical assistance to nurture a strong civil society and market economy. NED is successful precisely because it targets its assistance to grassroots democratic groups. 
   I do not support the report language because its implementation would undermine NED's mission while forcing NED to withdraw scarce resources from other priority countries. It would be a mistake to divert NED's modest budget to a handful of crisis situations which are already receiving enormous sums of international assistance. It is unlikely that the funds suggested in the report language could positively impact these war-torn areas, but by consuming 20 percent of NED's budget, the language will hamstring NED's ability to perform its work in many other critical countries. 
   NED is a cost-effective investment that advances our national interest and our fundamental values of democracy and freedom. It is crucial, therefore, that we address the committee's goals in the report language without compromising the ability of NED to carry out its work effectively. 
   I urge the Senate and House conferees on the Commerce, Justice, and State, the Judiciary, and related agencies appropriations bill to delete the report language directing the NED to expend funds for nation-building activities in four troubled conflicts.

   Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the International Academic Opportunity Act of 2000. I'm pleased to be joined by Senators SCHUMER, COLLINS, and FEINGOLD in introducing this important piece of legislation. 
   Our bill attempts to address a gap in U.S. institutions of higher education among undergraduate students who wish to study abroad but who lack the financial means to do so. Specifically, our bill would establish an undergraduate grant program in the Department of State for the purpose of assisting American students with limited financial means to pursue studies abroad. It would provide grants for eligible students of up to $5,000 toward the cost of studying overseas for up to one academic year. These grants would be made available from existing appropriations, so we are not requesting any new funds to administer the program. 
   The program would be administered by the Department of State and funded through the 150 International Affairs budget. Global education is a foreign policy and national security issue, not only an education matter. During the cold war period and now, international education is part of the glue that helps to hold alliances together, that promotes cooperative bilateral relationships, that enhances international trade and business and narrows the psychological distance between counties and cultures. Our target population are the many students who wish to study abroad but who are unable to do so because of financial limitations. Our bill attempts to remedy this gap in American higher education. 
   To qualify for these grants, an individual must be a student in good standing at a United States institution of higher education, must have been accepted for up to one academic year of study at an institution of higher education outside the United States or be in a study program abroad approved by the student's home institution, and must be a citizen or national of the United States. Priority would be given to those who have a demonstrated financial need and who meet these other eligibility requirements. 
   It is my understanding that this proposal has been endorsed by the American Council on Education, the Association of State College and Universities, the Alliance for International Education and Cultural Exchange, NAFSA (Association 
   of International Educators), the Institute of International Education, the American Councils for International Education: ACTR/ACCELS, and other educational associations and organizations involved in promoting and implementing international exchanges and higher education. 
   Mr. President, there are roughly five foreign students studying in the United States for every one U.S. student studying abroad. Only one percent of our total university population in the United States--about 15 million--studies abroad. This imbalance is troubling and should be rectified. 95 percent of the world's population--and all potential trading partners and customers for U.S. exports--live outside the United States. We need to improve the availability and the means for more students, scholars and practitioners to study abroad--in institutions of higher learning, to engage in language studies, to conduct field research, and to participate in international exchanges. 
   There is extensive research which indicates that experience in study abroad programs produces significant measurable language improvement, typically raising students from survival level skills to real fluency. Research also shows that alumni of study abroad programs view that experience as critical to their career choices and to the performances of their jobs. 
   In a globalized economy, our ability to understand, communicate, and conduct international commerce and other forms of cross-national and cross-cultural interactions hinge on our ability to understand and work effectively with other societies. Globalization makes the imperative of knowing and understanding the rest of the world more compelling than ever. The global economic and technology revolutions have helped redefine our nation's economic security. The opening of markets, the expansion of international trade, the extraordinary effects of Internet technology, and the need for American business to compete around the world require a larger global vision that can be advanced through expanded contacts and international education. 
   In order to make our program successful, other countries need to improve their exchange programs to attract American students by making more classroom space available, more and better housing, and improved language capabilities. For our part, we need to do more to encourage undergraduate students to explore the challenges and opportunities of living abroad in another culture, of being exposed to different values and different mores. 
   I believe this bill merits special attention. The costs are minimal, it adds no new funding to the already-strained appropriations for international affairs and it addresses the needs of those undergraduate American students who wish to study abroad but cannot ordinarily do so because they lack the financial means. 
   I hope my colleagues will support this initiative.

   Mr. LUGAR. I would like to ask the distinguished chairman of the Finance Committee, Senator ROTH, a brief question. Mr. Chairman, there are a number of important initiatives and oversight capabilities created in this legislation on PNTR. Not only do we make permanent our trading relationship with China, but we have included monitoring capabilities to ensure that the commitments agreed to in the WTO accession agreements are, in fact, lived up to by the Chinese government.

   Mr. LUGAR. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I would like then to state here that it is the intent of the bill that there be a review of the implementation of the 1992 Memorandum of Agreement between the United States and China on the Protection of Intellectual Property Rights. As you know, this agreement was reached so that American pharmaceutical compound patents issued between 1986 and 1993 would enjoy protection in China. As a number of disputes have arisen from this agreement, I think it is important that we have an independent and objective look at this agreement and then we can determine if additional efforts in this area are warranted.

   Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, today is National POW/MIA Recognition Day. As a Nation we remember and honor all those who were prisoners of war and those who are still MIA. It is altogether fitting that they have this special day where we express gratitude for their service, for their sacrifices, and for the sacrifices of their families. We also take this day to assure the many families who still await the return of a loved one that we have not forgotten. 
   As a former Navy officer, I feel strongly that the United States Government must fulfill its commitments to the men and women who serve in the armed forces. One of these commitments is using every available means to ensure the return of POWs and MIAs at the end of hostilities. We must continue to support the vigorous pursuit of this commitment through on-site investigations being undertaken in Indochina and through a fuller examination of records in the United States, Russia and Asia. I would like us to renew our promise to the families and to the Nation to tirelessly fight for the fullest possible disclosure of information about the many Americans missing or unaccounted for from World War I, World War II, the Korean War, in Southeast Asia, and from the Cold War. 
   As we renew that promise, we can also count some accomplishments. In the past year, the remains of 49 Americans were returned from the war in Southeast Asia; however, 2005 Americans remain unaccounted for from that war--1,511 in Vietnam alone. 
   All year, veterans in Indiana and around the country have been holding commemorative events marking the 50th anniversary of the Korean War. This year has also seen progress in negotiations with the North Korean Government. In June, we witnessed a historic summit between North and South Korea, which could lead to further breakthroughs. Within the past three months, joint United States-North Korean remains recovery operations have returned the remains of 28 Americans. Since 1996, teams from the U.S. Army Central Identification Laboratory in Hawaii have conducted 15 such operations and recovered remains believed to be 68 soldiers. Though many of these MIA files were dormant for years because we had no diplomatic ties with the North Koreans, advances in DNA identification procedures create the hope that all of these remains will be identified. 
   This is a team effort and requires the firm commitments of the Congress, the Administration, the Departments of Defense and State, the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the National Security Agency. I am hopeful that all of us, through continued humanitarian support and dedicated diplomatic endeavors, will gain further information about the servicemen still missing to honor their sacrifice and provide peace of mind to their loved ones.

   Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation to improve the summer food service program, which provides summer meals to poor children. 
   On an average school day in 1999, nearly 27 million children received lunches supported by the national school lunch program. Of that total, over 15 million of these children were poor. Over 7 million children participated in the school breakfast program and more than 6 million of these children were poor. These statistics clearly show that the American people are generous and compassionate regarding the nutritional status of our children, especially poor children who may not have access to enough food at home. 
   However, most of these poor children lose access to school lunches and breakfasts once the school year is over. The Federal Government does have programs to provide summer meals, but only about 22 percent of the poor children who get a school lunch also get a summer meal. Common sense tells us that children's hunger does not go on vacation at the end of the school year. 
   Basically, children can receive federally subsidized summer meals in 2 ways: through the summer food service program; or, if they are in summer school or year-round school, through the regular national school lunch and school breakfast programs. 
   Summer school and year-round school students can get the regular school lunch and breakfast programs. Just as in the regular school year, students can receive free, reduced price or full price meals, depending upon their families' income. In July 1999, 1.1 million children received free or reduced price meals this way. 
   The summer food service program was created to provide summer meals for children who are not in summer school or year-round school. The establishment of a summer food service program site depends upon a local entity agreeing to operate a site. At the local level, the summer food service program (SFSP) is run by approved sponsors, including school districts, local government agencies, camps, private nonprofit organizations or post-secondary schools sponsoring NCAA National Youth Sports Programs. Sponsors provide free meals to a group of children at a central site, such as a school or a community center or at satellite sites, such as playgrounds. Sponsors receive payments from USDA, through their State agencies, for the documented food costs of the meals they serve and for their documented operating costs. 
   The program is targeted toward serving poor children. States approve SFSP meal sites as open, enrolled, or camp sites. Open sites operate in low-income area where at least half of the children come from families with incomes at or below 185 percent of the Federal poverty level, making them eligible for free and reduced-price meals. Meals and snacks are served free to any child at the open site. 
   Enrolled sites provide free meals to all children enrolled in an activity program at the site if at least half of them are eligible for free and reduced-price  meals. Camps may also participate in SFSP. They receive payments only for the meals served to children who are eligible for free and reduced-price school meals. 
   At most sites, children receive either one or two reimbursable meals or a meal and a snack each day. Camps and sites that primarily serve migrant children may be approved to serve up to three meals to each child, each day. 
   Participation in the SFSP and the summer portion of the school lunch program varies widely by State. Comparing the number of low-income children in summer programs to the number who get free and reduced price meals during the regular school year gives a reasonable 
   measure of how well the summer meal needs of low-income children are being met. According to the most recent data supplied by USDA, only about 22 percent of those children who received a regular school lunch also received a summer meal. Again according to USDA, participation ranges from over 53 percent in the District of Columbia to under 3 percent in Alaska. My home state of Indiana serves under 10 percent of these children. 
   In August, I visited the successful summer feeding program implemented this year by the New Albany-Floyd County Consolidated School Corporation in Indiana. I discussed with community leaders ideas to encourage more participation in the program throughout my home state. 
    Mr. President, hunger does not take a summer vacation. We need to examine new means of encouraging local entities to agree to offer the summer food service program in poor areas. In talking with program experts, a recurring problem they mentioned regarding the decision to enter the program was the amount of paperwork necessary to gain USDA approval. 
   That is why we propose today legislation to provide a targeted method of increasing participation in those states with very low participation. This method will be tested for a few years to see if it is effective and, thus, should be extended to all states. 
   Under current SFSP law, sponsors get a food cost reimbursement and an administrative reimbursement of the amounts that they document, up to a maximum amount. Based on the most recent data available, SFSP sponsors document costs sufficient to receive the maximum reimbursement over 90 percent of the time. Some institutions (e.g., schools, parks departments) may not offer the SFSP because they do not want to put up with the administrative burden of documenting all their costs in a manner acceptable to USDA. Under the regular school lunch program, schools do not have to document their costs, but instead automatically receive their meal reimbursements. The extra paperwork burden of documenting all their costs may discourage sponsors from offering summer meals. Public sponsors, such as schools and parks departments, have to meet public accounting standards that make it unlikely that money meant for child nutrition could be siphoned off and used for unlawful purposes. 
   My bill would establish a pilot project to reduce the paperwork required of schools and other public institutions (like parks departments) to run a summer food service program, and thus, hopefully, encourage more sponsors to join the program and offer summer meals. The bill would allow, in low participation states, public sponsors to automatically receive the maximum reimbursement for both food costs and administrative costs. In this way, the SFSP would be identical to the school lunch program. 
   Low participation states would be defined as those states where the number of children receiving summer meals (compared to the number receiving free or reduced price lunches during the school year) was less than half the national average participation in the summer meals programs (compared to the number receiving free or reduced price lunches during the school year). This pilot program would run for 3 years, FY 01 to FY 03. 
   USDA would be required to study whether reducing the paperwork burden increased participation in the program. USDA would also be required to study whether meal quality or program integrity was affected by removing the requirement for sponsors to document their spending. Results of the study will be available for the 2003 child nutrition reauthorization. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.

   Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I rise to join Senator FEINSTEIN and other Members from both sides of the aisle to introduce the Unilateral Palestinian Statehood Disapproval Act of 2000. I am pleased to be an original co-sponsor of this legislation. 
   At the conclusion of the July round of negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority at Camp David, Prime Minister Barak and Chairman Arafat issued a statement agreeing on the importance of ``avoiding unilateral action that prejudices the outcome of negotiations.'' They both acknowledged that progress is best assured if both parties refrain from unilateral actions that would have the effect of undermining the peace process. 
   After the Camp David talks ended, Chairman Arafat announced that he intended to unilaterally declare an independent Palestinian state by September 13 if negotiations with Israel did not conclude in a satisfactory manner by then. Such a statement is harmful to the negotiations and would be disastrous to the peace process. 
   It is important for the Congress to be heard on this issue. A unilateral declaration of a Palestinian state is objectionable and would create an unnecessary rupture in our ability to work with the Palestinian Authority to advance the peace process. It is my hope that Chairman Arafat will listen to the voices of other leaders in the Arab world, and elsewhere, which have counseled caution and urged him to refrain from these unilateral steps toward statehood. 
   Our legislation proposes several targeted limitations and restrictions on the Palestinian Authority should they decide to declare a Palestinian state in advance of a final agreement. It states that if Chairman Arafat unilaterally declares a Palestinian state, the U.S. should not recognize it, that we should work with our friends and allies not to recognize any such state, and that we should downgrade the Palestinian office in the United States to an information office. 
   The legislation places limitations on official U.S. assistance to a unilaterally declared Palestinian state but provides exceptions for cooperation on anti-terrorism and security matters. Our bill also urges the President to oppose membership to a unilaterally declared Palestinian state in the United Nations and to oppose any economic and financial assistance from the U.N., affiliated agencies and international financial institutions. 
   It is my hope that none of these restrictions will have to be implemented. Because we want to insure that the President can use all the tools available to him to assist the parties to succeed in the peace negotiations, we included a presidential national interest waiver authority on those provisions pertaining to economic and financial assistance. 
   I hope my colleagues will agree to support this legislation and the long-standing effort to construct a comprehensive peace in the Middle East.

   Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, the role of unilateral economic sanctions in the conduct of American foreign policy has been part of our debate in the Congress and in the executive branch for the past three years. Attempts to modify or reform the way the United States utilizes unilateral economic sanctions in the conduct of our foreign policy have consumed the attention of several committees, spawned numerous sanctions reform bills--including my own efforts--resolutions and amendments, generated a number of floor debates, stimulated countless discussions within this body and with the administration and prompted many press conferences and news releases. It even moved the distinguished Majority Leader to appoint an ad hoc bipartisan Senate task force to sort through the issue in the hopes of finding a policy path or sanctions that best promotes our national interest. 
   Outside the United States Government, virtually every think tank, university, trade association, and foreign policy association has invested time and resources to studying, analyzing and making recommendations on the subject of unilateral economic sanctions. This is as it should be. The subject is integral to our approach on foreign policy, national security and international trade. 
   I have been pleased that our debate and the large volume of literature have led to considerable re-thinking about the efficacy of unilateral economic sanctions. I have noted that the frequent resort to use of unilateral sanctions to achieve foreign policy goals has declined and that our sophistication about the inter-relationship between unilateral economic sanctions and policy has grown dramatically. One of the most important players in our debate over the past few years has been the unique coalition of some 675 export-oriented companies in the United States called USA*ENGAGE. They have been critical in helping to shape the debate on unilateral economic sanctions, a debate which continues virtually as I speak.  
   I recently read a short speech by Mr. William Lane who serves as the Chairman of the USA*ENGAGE trade association and the Washington Director of Caterpillar corporation titled ``USA*ENGAGE: Lessons Learned: The Cost of Conducting Foreign Policy on the Cheap.'' The remarks were offered at the French Institute on International Relations last month.

   Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, our colleagues have spoken so well about PAUL COVERDELL as a gentleman, as a person who was thoughtful and persuasive. As Senator DOMENICI said, he worked the aisles indefatigably with the ideals that he held. 
   First of all, it is fundamental that PAUL COVERDELL was elected to the Senate. It was a very difficult contest--one not decided on election day, the day of his first election. He was an extraordinarily experienced politician and statesman in the State of Georgia, with remarkable legislative experience as a leader throughout much of his tenure. But those from our party in Georgia have a very difficult time with that, and that was the case for PAUL. It was a very close contest. He won graciously, came to the Senate, and had a difficult reelection contest for which he began to prepare early and in which he asked many of us to participate. But he did it all so gracefully, so thoughtfully, so constructively, that we rarely think of PAUL COVERDELL as a very tough political competitor and someone who was in a difficult arena. It took great courage to make those races to begin with and remarkable tenacity to follow through to success. 
   My own first impressions of PAUL COVERDELL came during the often commented period in which he served as head of the Peace Corps. PAUL COVERDELL was in Latin America and various other places where some of us tried to work for democracy in those days. They were remarkable days--the 1980s--in which all of the countries of our hemisphere finally landed on their feet with democratic institutions. That was true of countries in Asia and countries elsewhere around the world. PAUL COVERDELL's tenure in the Peace Corps is distinguished by the fact that the Peace Corps had matured, literally. 
   Many members of the Corps were now very mature individuals, not young persons out of college, or in some type of transition before they went into another professional career. As a matter of fact, under PAUL's tenure, the Peace Corps evolved into a group of teachers, environmentalists, and farm experts, in addition to, still, a very strong component of young idealistic people. It was this combination of people that gave sustenance to democracy, helped the economy, helped the pushing forward of intellectual pursuits, and likewise forged an increasing friendship and reverence for the United States and for our traditions. 
   Therefore, it was with great excitement that I welcomed PAUL COVERDELL to the Foreign Relations Committee. That is a committee on which he belonged. He made huge contributions on that committee. We focused frequently on Latin America, Central America, South America, and the Caribbean--areas with which he was well acquainted from previous times when he had really been there in the beginning of the evolution of many democratic propositions. I sat next to him in the committee through the markups, through the hearings. He was always cheerful. He was always thoughtful in exchanging views in a very forthright way. I admired and I listened to PAUL. He made a very strong contribution day by day in the work of the committee. 
   But my close association with PAUL came in the Agriculture Committee. I will mention that PAUL was chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee, Subcommittee on Marketing, Inspection, and Product Promotion. He did a great job. We have just four subcommittees in the Agriculture Committee. These are committees that have opportunities to hold hearings 
   independently, or to contribute to the body as a whole as they may wish. PAUL COVERDELL had a broad philosophical view of agriculture that included freedom--freedom for the farmers whom he represented to make decisions with regard to management of their land and their crops and their livestock, and the prospects for their communities. He championed that idea without apology. But he also was very much in tune with the very specific problems of Georgia farmers. 
   They included an interest in peanuts. PAUL and I had disagreements about the peanut program. In fact, it has either been my fate or privilege for many years to suggest reform. PAUL always feared that those reforms would come during his time, and he tried to dissuade me and, having failed in that respect, to at least bring me up to date on what the actual problems of peanut farmers were, how they could be helped, and how the legislation I was suggesting could be brought before the committee and modified, and ways to be helpful to the overall policy and to the constituents whom he saw very much in need of his support. 
   Mr. President, he prevailed in that area. We made reforms. But I think they were reforms that were very heavily influenced by the hand of PAUL COVERDELL. Due to the fact that he did his homework, he was persuasive, and he knew the farmers. He spoke for them. 
   In addition to the peanut situation, which was always with him, in recent years, severe drought--and this is one of those years in Georgia--occupied much of PAUL COVERDELL's time, working with specific landowners and communities, with much of his State in the throes of a very difficult predicament. As I looked at the weather map just last week, I saw how the drought problem has shifted just in a very few weeks in our country from patches that covered much of the area of the United States to very isolated situations. Unfortunately, Georgia is one of those situations. It is especially cruel because the rains have come to the Midwest and to many of the plains States with isolated problems still--in some parts of Nebraska, Iowa, and the Dakotas. 
   But PAUL, in his own way, always made certain we knew about Georgia and the very specific problems there. So when we had the large debates that we were privileged to have on the floor, dealing with risk management, dealing with payments to farmers to supplement their income in a very difficult year, and with specific emergencies, PAUL was very active in that debate. He was successful in that debate. 
   As Senator DOMENICI pointed out in his beautiful statement, PAUL COVERDELL was always one who thanked everybody involved and made certain  that they knew of his care and attention and appreciation. It was my privilege to receive one of those notes after the debate which we had here. It is very difficult to try to think about the representation of that State without thinking of PAUL COVERDELL. He was so good, so faithful and, really, so effective and articulate. He was such a good friend. We will miss him. Our thoughts are with him and with Nancy. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of this amendment aimed at providing tax relief to America's farmers. 
   I want to highlight and share my strong enthusiasm for one provision contained as part of this amendment aimed at encouraging farmers, ranchers and other small businesses to donate food to hunger relief organizations. This language is taken from bipartisan legislation I introduced earlier this year--S. 2084, the Hunger Relief Tax Incentive Act. 
   Current law provides corporations with a special deduction for donations to food banks, but it excludes farmers, ranchers and restaurant owners from donating food under the same tax incentive. This language would address this inequity by extending the deduction to all business taxpayers and by increasing the deduction to the fair market value of the donation. 
   While recently visiting food banks in Indiana, I met a Hoosier apple farmer who donates several hundred bushels of apples annually, despite the lack of a tax deduction for his actions. Because of labor and transportation costs, it would have been more cost effective to throw the food away. This should not be the case. Our tax laws should reward charitable giving, not discourage it. 
   Citizens have moved off of welfare, but not out of poverty. A December 1999 study by the U.S. Conference of Mayors found that requests for emergency food assistance increased by an average of 18 percent in American cities over the previous year and that 21 percent of emergency food requests could not be met. I can personally attest to this increased need after recently visiting the Tri-State Food Bank in Evansville, Gleaners Food Bank in Indianapolis, and Community Harvest Food Bank in Ft. Wayne. 
   This language, which enjoys broad support in the Senate, would be an effective private sector approach to addressing hunger. It has the endorsement of several hunger relief, food, and agricultural organizations, including the American Farm Bureau, the National Farmers Union, the National Restaurant Association, America's Second Harvest Food Banks, and the Salvation Army.  
   I encourage my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to vote in support of this amendment that benefits our farmers and our food banks.

   Mr. LUGAR. I agree that few areas of our education funding can have a more positive impact on education in America than the CSRD. This program is a key tool for helping struggling schools adopt important reforms. Good reform programs are a bargain for our schools and our children when we compare their costs to that of retention, special education and illiteracy. In fact, I filed an amendment to S. 2, legislation crafted to reauthorize the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, that would have more than doubled funding for this important program. Unfortunately, this bill has been set aside.

   Mr. LUGAR. Success for All is an exemplary research-based reform program. I have spent time with Dr. Slavin, who developed this program at Johns Hopkins, and I have been visiting Success for All schools in Indiana. The results in these schools are so promising that I have written to every superintendent in Indiana urging them to take a look at the program. 
   The discipline and accountability of Success for All greatly reduce the possibility that students will fail. By teaching children to read in the early grades, our schools can avoid holding students back, promoting them with insufficient ability or transferring them out of the normal curriculum to special education courses. Referrals to special education in Success for All schools have been shown to decrease by approximately 50 percent. In schools where Success for All is taught, students learn to read by the end of the third grade. By the fifth grade, students in these schools are often testing a full grade level ahead of students in other schools.

    Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce the Grain Standards Improvement Act of 2000. I am pleased that the ranking minority member of the Senate Agriculture Committee, Senator HARKIN, has joined me as a cosponsor. 
   The United States Grain Standards Act was enacted in 1916 as a means of eliminating confusion resulting from the use of many different sets of grain standards applied by different grain inspection organizations operating without national coordination and supervision. Created by this Act and operating within the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), the Federal Grain Inspection Service (FGIS) sets and administers official grain standards and conducts grain inspection services. 
   The Act authorizes FGIS to establish standards of ``kind, class, quality and condition for corn, wheat, rye, oats, barley, flax seed, sorghum, soybeans, mixed grain and such other grains as in the administrator's judgment the usages of the trade may warrant and permit.'' The FGIS administrator is authorized to develop standards or procedures for accurate weighing and weight certification and controls for grain shipped in interstate or foreign commerce. The Act also established certain performance requirements for grain inspection and weighing equipment. The certainty of these standards and the credibility and integrity of the inspection system has allowed our domestic and international markets to flourish as a result. 
   But improvements are necessary to keep up with the changing markets. The legislation that I am introducing today is based on legislation proposed by the Administration earlier this year. The Gain Standards Improvement Act of 2000 will reauthorize the collection of fees, the FGIS Advisory Committee, and funding for FGIS until September 30, 2005. 
   In order to keep up with advances in technology, FGIS needs flexibility in the way that commodity samples can be obtained. Grain marketing patterns, quality attributes, and quality testing methods are changing rapidly. New quality traits developed through biotechnology have increased the speed of change. This Act will provide flexibility needed by FGIS to continue to maintain an efficient sampling system. 
   In general, under current law, only one official federal inspection agency can operate within geographic boundaries. The 1993 amendments to the Grain Standards Act provided for a pilot program that allowed for more than one official inspection agency within a single geographic area at interior locations. These programs were successful in facilitating the marketing of grain without jeopardizing the integrity of the system. This bill will permanently authorize this policy. 
   This legislation is supported by the National Association of State Departments of Agriculture, the Association of American Warehouse Control Officials, the National Grain and Feed Association, the American Farm Bureau Federation, the National Farmers Union and other agricultural commodity organizations. 
   The credibility and integrity of the United States grain inspection must be maintained to allow U.S. producers to continue to feed the world through our marketing system. The Grain Standards Improvement Act of 2000 will help FGIS to continue these high standards and increase the economic efficiency of the U.S. grain marketing system.

    Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I rise before you today to recognize the Belles of Indiana who are celebrating their 45th Reunion this summer. The Belles of Indiana, a choral group comprised of Indiana University students, were the first singing group to perform overseas with the United Service Organizations (USO). The Belles entertained soldiers stationed in Japan and Korea, performing 75 shows in 77 days during the summer of 1955. Their voices and energy brought great joy to all those who heard them perform. These singers displayed strong patriotism for their country and acted as outstanding ambassadors from Indiana. I am pleased to submit their names for the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD because of their great contributions to our soldiers and country. 
   I would like to commend the following members on their participation: Doris Day Block, Robert Bluemle, Vera Scammon Broughton, Dennis Escol, Roberta Ratliff Graham, Sondra Gauthier Harroff, Sally Graham Johnson, Helen Rapp Nefkens, Sandra Pawol Overack, Carolyn Hill Pain, Joyce Harrod Sakakini, Nancy Speed Schultz, Sue Ann Steeves, Cynthia Findley Stewart, Annabelle Baldridge Menguy, Sharlie Shull Stuart, Linda Foncannon Tucker, Ellen Dallas Wiggins, Mary Musgrave Wirts, Joyce Lancaster Voit, and Barbara Lockard Zimmerman. I would also like to recognize those members of the Belles of Indiana who are no longer with us: Eugene and Keitha Bayless, (Choral Director and his wife), Mary Mauer, Irma Batley Corcoran, Mary Sinclair Baron, and Joan Drew Irwin. 
   I am pleased to pay tribute to these great Americans whose positive attitude and high energy boosted morale for our overseas troops. The history of America is replete with stories of its sons and daughters being summoned and responding to their nation's call to duty. It is a proud history of accomplishment, honor, and victory. The Belles of Indiana answered their nation's call to duty and diligently persevered to be emissaries for the families and friends of servicemen who were far away from home. 
   I extend my congratulations to the Belles of Indiana for being the first entertainment group to travel and perform with the United Service Organization. I ask my colleagues to join me today in honoring these courageous  women and men for their valiant service to our country.

    Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I rise today with Senator GRAMM, distinguished Chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, and Senator FITZGERALD, distinguished Chairman of the Subcommittee on Research, Nutrition and General Legislation of the Senate Agriculture Committee, to introduce  legislation to reauthorize the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA), which lapses on September 30th of this year. The Commodity Futures Modernization Act of 2000 would reauthorize the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA) for five additional years and would reform the Commodity Exchange Act in three primary ways. First, it would incorporate the unanimous recommendations of the President's Working Group (PWG) on the proper legal and regulatory treatment of over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives. Second, it would codify the regulatory relief proposal of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) to ensure that futures exchanges are appropriately regulated and remain competitive. Lastly, this legislation would reform the Shad-Johnson jurisdictional accord, which banned single stock futures 18 years ago. 
   Derivative instruments, both exchange-traded and over-the-counter (OTC), have played a significant role in our economy's current expansion due to their innovative nature and their risk-transferring attributes. According to the International Swaps and Derivatives Association, the global derivatives market has a notional value that exceeds $58 trillion and it has grown at a rate exceeding 20 percent since 1990. Identified by Alan Greenspan as the ``most significant event in finance of the past decade,'' the development of the derivatives market has substantially added to the productivity and wealth of our nation. 
   Derivatives enable companies to unbundle and transfer risk to those entities who are willing and able to accept it. By doing so, efficiency is enhanced as firms are able to concentrate on their core business objective. A farmer can purchase a futures contract, one type of derivative, in order to lock in a price for his crop at harvest. Automobile manufacturers, whose profits earned overseas can fluctuate with changes in currency values, can minimize this uncertainty through derivatives, allowing them to focus on the business of building cars. Banks significantly lessen their exposure to interest rate movements by entering into derivatives contracts known as swaps, which enable these institutions to hedge their risk by exchanging variable and fixed rates of interests. 
   Signed into law in 1974, the Commodity Exchange Act requires that futures contracts be traded on a regulated exchange. As a result, a futures contract that is traded off an exchange is illegal and unenforceable. When Congress enacted the CEA and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) to enforce it, this was not a concern. The meanings of `futures' and `exchange' were relatively apparent. Furthermore, the over-the-counter derivatives business was in its infancy. However, in the 26 years since the statute's creation, the OTC swaps and derivatives market, sparked by innovation and technology, has significantly outpaced the exchange-traded futures markets. And along with this expansion, the definitions of a swap and a future began to blur. 
   In 1998, the CFTC released a concept release on OTC derivatives, which was perceived by many as a precursor to regulating these instruments as futures. Just the threat of reaching this conclusion could have had considerable ramifications, given the size and importance of the OTC market. The legal uncertainty interjected by this dispute jeopardized the entirety of the OTC market and threatened to move significant portions of the business overseas. If we were to lose 
   this market, most likely to London, it would take years to bring it back to U.S. soil. The resulting loss of business and jobs would be immeasurable. 
   This threat led the Treasury Department, the Federal Reserve, and the SEC to oppose the concept release and request that Congress enact a moratorium on the CFTC's ability to regulate these instruments until after the President's Working Group (PWG) could complete a study on the issue. As a result, Congress passed a six-month moratorium on the CFTC's ability to regulate over-the-counter derivatives. Despite reservations, I supported this moratorium because it brought legal assurance to this skittish market and it allowed the President's Working Group time to develop recommendations on the most appropriate legal treatment of OTC derivatives. In November 1999, the President's Working Group completed its unanimous recommendations on OTC derivatives and presented Congress with these findings. 
   This legislation adopts much of the recommendations of the PWG report. Our bill contains three mechanisms for ensuring that legal certainty is attained and that certain transactions remain outside the Commodity Exchange Act. The first, the electronic trading facility exclusion, would exclude transactions in financial and energy commodities from the Act if conducted: (1) on a principal to principal basis; (2) between institutions or sophisticated persons with high net worth; and (3) on an electronic trading facility. The second would exclude these transactions if (1) they are conducted between institutions or sophisticated persons with high net worth; and (2) they are not on a trading facility. The third exclusion clarifies the Treasury Amendment language already contained in the CEA. It would exclude all transactions in foreign currency and government securities from the Act unless those transactions are futures contracts and traded on an organized exchange. As recommended by the PWG, the bill would give the CFTC jurisdiction over non-regulated off-exchange retail futures transactions in foreign currency. Another important recommendation of the PWG was to authorize futures clearing facilities to clear OTC derivatives in an effort to lessen systemic risk and this bill incorporates this finding. 
   As part of this legal certainty section, our legislation also addresses the concern that excluding OTC derivatives from the futures laws will invite the SEC to regulate these products as securities. With Senator GRAMM's leadership, this legislation would adopt language that would ensure that these products maintain their current regulatory status and remain healthy and competitive. 
   The second major section of this legislation addresses regulatory relief. In February of this year, the CFTC issued a regulatory relief proposal that would provide relief to futures exchanges and their customers. Instead of listing specific requirements for complying with the CEA, the proposal would require exchanges to meet internationally agreed-upon core principals. The CFTC proposal creates tiers of regulation for exchanges based on whether the underlying commodities being traded are susceptible to manipulation or whether the users of the exchange are limited to institutional customers. 
   The legislation incorporates this framework. A board of trade that is designated as a contract market would receive the highest level of regulation due to the fact that these products are susceptible to manipulation or are offered to retail customers. Futures on agricultural commodities would fall into this category. This bill also sets out that in lieu of contract market designation, a board of trade may register as a Derivatives Transaction Execution Facility (DTEF) if the products being offered are not susceptible to manipulation and are traded among institutional customers or retail customers who use large Futures Commission Merchants (FCMs) who are members of a clearing facility. Lastly, a board of trade may choose to be an 
   Exempt Board of Trade (XBOT) and not be subject to the Act (except for the CFTC's anti-manipulation authority) if the products being offered are traded among institutional customers only (absolutely no retail) and the instruments are not susceptible to manipulation. Our bill would allow a board of trade that is a DTEF or an XBOT to opt to trade derivatives that are otherwise excluded from the Act on these facilities and to the extent that these products are traded on these facilities, the CFTC would have exclusive jurisdiction over them. With this provision, the intent is to provide these facilities that trade derivatives with a choice--if regulation is beneficial, the facility may choose to be regulated. If not, the facility may choose to be excluded or exempted from the Act. 
   The bill's last section addresses the Shad-Johnson jurisdictional accord. In 1982, SEC Chairman John Shad and CFTC Chairman Phil Johnson reached an agreement on dividing jurisdiction between the agencies for those products that had characteristics of both securities and futures. Known as the Shad-Johnson Accord, this agreement prohibited single stock futures and delineated jurisdiction between the SEC  and the CFTC on stock index futures and other options. 
   Meant as a temporary agreement, many have suggested that the Shad-Johnson accord should be repealed. The President's Working Group unanimously agreed that the Accord can be repealed if regulatory disparities are resolved between the regulation of futures and securities. Recently, the General Accounting Office (GAO) released a report that found that there is no legitimate policy reasons for maintaining the ban on single stock futures since they are being traded in foreign markets, in the OTC market, and synthetically in the options markets. Senator GRAMM, chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, and I sent a letter in December requesting the CFTC and the SEC to make recommendations on reforming the Shad-Johnson. On March 2, the SEC and CFTC responded that, although progress had been made, the agencies could not resolve these issues before October. Disappointment with this answer led Senator GRAMM and I to once again ask SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt and CFTC Chairman Bill Rainer to attempt to resolve the problems surrounding lifting the ban. Unfortunately, the agencies were not able to reach an agreement within our time-frame. 
   This legislation would repeal the prohibition on single stock futures and narrow-based stock index futures. It would allow these products, termed designated futures on securities, to trade on either a CFTC-regulated contract market or a SEC-regulated national securities exchange or association. The SEC would maintain its insider trading and antifraud enforcement authority over these products traded on a contract market and the CFTC would maintain its anti-manipulation authority, including large trader reporting, over these products traded on a national securities exchange or association. Margin levels on these products would be harmonized with the options markets. The bill would provide the regulators with one year after enactment to resolve any remaining issues. 
   The goal of this legislation is to ensure that the United States remains a global leader in the derivatives marketplace and that these markets are appropriately and effectively regulated. Due to the shortened legislative calendar in this election year, it will be difficult to pass this bill without momentum and a strong base of support. If Congress fails to enact a bill, we will begin the debate again next year. However, in this technology-driven economy, a one year delay is an eternity. Legal uncertainty for OTC derivatives will remain and our futures markets will continue to lose market share due in part to an outdated regulatory structure. For this reason, it is imperative that Congress enact thoughtful legislation this year when it has a golden opportunity to do so.

   Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I rise to speak about the Agricultural Risk Protection Act of 2000. I am very pleased this legislation is before the Senate today for final consideration after a great deal of work by Senators of both parties and both sides of this Capitol. I am here to testify that there is proud bipartisan support for this legislation, highlighted by the fact that all members of the conference committee for this legislation signed the conference report after our meeting yesterday. 
   This conference report contains several titles. Title I pertains to crop insurance important to so many agriculture producers throughout the country. The fiscal year 2001 budget resolution provided $8 billion over 5 years for crop insurance legislation. This conference report increases premium subsidies to make crop insurance more affordable. The bill also tightens program integrity provisions to limit abuse. It also helps producers of non-insured crops, predominantly specialty crops, by making the non-insured assistance program more readily available to them. Finally, the legislation encourages farmers to adopt a broad array of risk management activities beyond crop insurance alone. 
   Title II of this conference report provides $7.14 billion in economic assistance to farmers as provided in the fiscal year 2001 budget resolution. Included in this conference report is $5.466 for a market loss payment for farmers in this fiscal year based on last year's AMTA payment rate. Five hundred million dollars is provided for oilseed producers. Funds are also provided for specialty crops including funding for purchases of crops that have experienced low prices in 1998 or 1999 and loans for apple producers who are suffering economic and income loss. Finally, funding is provided for purchases of commodities for the school lunch program which benefits school children as well as farmers. 
   Title III of the conference report contains the Biomass Research and Development Act, a bill which I originally introduced in the Senate last year. This legislation establishes a focused, integrated, and innovation-driven research effort to develop technologies for the production of biobased industrial products. The bill also authorizes a biomass research and development initiative to competitively award grants to carry out research and development of low cost and sustainable biobased industrial products. 
   Title IV and V of the conference report consolidates and streamlines existing statutory authorities for plant protection and authorizes civil penalties for harming or interfering with animals used for USDA inspections. Senator CRAIG had originally introduced this legislation in the Senate. 
   I thank Senator HARKIN, the ranking minority member of the committee, and Senator ROBERTS and Senator KERREY for their hard work and that of their staff in finalizing the crop insurance legislation. All members of the conference committee and their staff are thanked for their important contributions to the process. 
   Finally, I also want to thank Congressman COMBEST, the chair of the House Agriculture Committee, and Ranking Minority Member STENHOLM and their staff for their hard work in the past few weeks on this legislation. 
   I am pleased to report the House of Representatives took action on this conference report this morning and passed it unanimously. I am hopeful that we may have a result similar, if not exactly the same as that, this afternoon in this body. 
   Let me simply add that this legislation is of enormous importance to American agriculture. I have tried to summarize as succinctly as possible these five titles. But the consequences of this bill are very substantial. The dollars involved I have outlined. But the confidence, the hope that comes to producers who have had great discouragement in terms of low prices, in terms of export markets that have been withheld due to economic conditions in Asia, biotechnology disputes now in Europe, very great problems in negotiating trade agreements, whether it be the Seattle scene or the Washington scene more recently--this has been a very tough time. 
   The Chair comes from the State adjacent to my own, a State which, like Indiana, must export half of the soybeans we produce and about a third of the corn we produce. There can be no prosperity in American agriculture without vigorous negotiations to knock down these trade barriers and to open up prospects for our farmers to realize the benefits of having the best--the best in terms of quality, the best in terms of price. 
   These economic circumstances do not pertain if there are barriers to exports. But in this interim period, it is appropriate that Congress has understood these unusual international problems and understood we are in transition to more market-oriented farming. The crop insurance title in particular recognizes the possibility of farmers becoming much better marketers, much better business people, which all of us will have to become if we are, in fact, to succeed over the coming generation. 
   I know many Senators will want to speak on this issue. I yield the floor.

   Mr. LUGAR. I appreciate the remarks by my colleague from Idaho, Senator CRAIG. I agree that the Senate Agriculture Committee should review how these growers can recover their economic losses resulting from illegal actions by federal employees. The Department of Agriculture has oversight responsibility for the actions that may have resulted in millions of dollars of losses to these growers. This matter should be fully explored and resolved. As part of committee review, I will continue to receive reports from the office of the Inspector General. It is important that this industry regain confidence in the inspection system that they use. 
   Mr. President, two provisions of the conference agreement warrant some clarification as to how they should be carried out. Section 243(g) allows a third State to expand coverage of the Child and Adult Care Food Program to additional for-profit child care centers serving lower-income children. It should be clear to the Secretary in implementing this amendment that the additional State must meet the criteria for approval at the time of enactment and is one that exempts all of its lower-income families from child care cost-sharing requirements, while allowing fees to be charged on a sliding scale to higher-income families. Section 243(b)(2) requires that a minimum number of site visits to day care centers, homes, and sponsors be conducted. The amendment recognizes that the Secretary can strengthen this measure by requiring more than the minimum numbers called for in the amendment.

   Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senators from Georgia and Kansas. It is a privilege to follow on some of the thoughts of the distinguished Senator from Kansas, as he has discussed multilateral organizations and focused especially on NATO which, in the judgment of many of us, is the most important and successful of these organizations in which the United States is a member. 
   It is axiomatic, at least for many in foreign policy, that Europe counts for the United States. By that I mean simply this: that although throughout our history many have argued that we could get along by ourselves on this continent and that entanglement in the affairs of Europe was often described as nefarious skullduggery statesmanship without scruple, that eventually we come back to the fact that in the small world in which we live now, what happens on that continent matters a great deal to our security and to our prosperity. 
   It is for this reason that the United States stayed in Europe after World War II. To state it very simply, as German Foreign Minister Fischer stated when he visited with our Foreign Relations Committee this week: The United States presence, the decision to stay, made all the difference in the last half century. It made a difference in terms of peace on the Europe continent, which had not had such an era of peace in a whole millennium. 
   It made a very great difference for us, the United States, leaving aside NATO and the security it provided, because of the collective defense of NATO members against the perceived menace of the former Soviet Union and its allies. The fact is that through the Marshall Plan, and through many other economic associations, the European countries grew substantially and so did our markets and so did our prosperity. We tend to take this all for granted, but only in the last 50 years has this been a fact. 
   We came to a point after the breakup of the former Soviet Union in which many argued, and I was not the one who originated the term, but I adopted it in a tour I took of Europe in 1993, that either NATO would go ``out of area or out of business.'' By that I meant simply that the idea of collective defense against the former Soviet Union, which had broken up, made much less sense than it had made before. Some would have said the Soviet Union might revive suddenly and attack hapless European nations, but this became less and less likely. In fact, we found in the Desert Storm war, that our problem was that NATO was not equipped to deal with conflicts out of area. It was a pickup game in which we enlisted various nations. 
   This out of area action had been contemplated at the time of the United Nations Charter in Article 4, which Senator ROBERTS has cited. John Foster Dulles spoke openly and eloquently on that point. It was anticipated that NATO members from time to time would act out of area in their collective efforts and for collective security. So we did that in Desert Storm and the idea was always, from the time of the United Nations Charter and the NATO Charter onward, that nations could freely decide to join in such actions. In the case of Desert Storm they did so. 
   Now that a whole new set of facts began to come forward, in which there were countries--Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, and others--but mainly the first three--in which the point was made: We are a democracy. We are searching for freedom. We are searching for relevance and association with others who want freedom as we do. 
   Some argued the evolution of Europe might have come entirely through the European Union, through the economic union of the members. But most of us noted that was going very slowly. It still goes slowly. Poland is not a member of the European Union as we speak, and it is not contemplated that it will be for several years. This is now a very large country with a functioning 
    economy and a democracy. 
   The point was that collective security meant making certain that the gains, the victories of the cold war, were ensured and were solidified. That was the debate that we had a short time ago with regard to expansion of NATO. Some argued: Why expand if there is no particular threat? Why not wait and see how the threat shapes up? You can always take on new members in the event things are troubled. 
   But many argued, and I was one, that the integration of forces, the building of institutions, takes time. Even in the successful war we fought in the desert, the weapons systems that were employed took 25 years to evolve. It is very probable that the strengths we are now building with new members in Europe, in NATO, will make a difference in terms of their collective security, and I believe in ours. With the crisis over, many persons in the United States and maybe in this body, tend to ask: Why are we involved in Europe? In fact, why can't Europeans run their own affairs? They say it is a troublesome situation to have our forces involved there, meddling and in harm's way. 
   We went through this in a very practical way with regard to the war in Bosnia. As you may recall, in the latter stages of the Bush administration,  there was anxiety on the part of President Bush as to what was happening in the former Yugoslavia. He was strongly advised by European leaders that they knew better what was happening there, that our involvement was really not particularly welcomed. President Bush may have welcomed that advice, for all I know. But in any event, his determination was to leave that problem alone, so the conflict continued to progress badly in terms of the loss of life and displacement of persons and refugees and so forth. 
   President Clinton attacked former President Bush in the 1992 campaign for failing to have a plan for Bosnia. But when President Clinton came into office in 1993 he found out how difficult that situation was. 
   I know from my own experience, traveling with Senator Nunn in 1993, talking on the phone with President Clinton over long distance as he asked what we were finding out and how things were going? He was attempting to evolve a policy. 
   He sent Secretary Christopher to Europe about that time, a trip which was very unsuccessful. The Secretary talked with the British and then the French and gave our views and asked their views. They had all sorts of views, all of them contradictory, and none of them helpful with regard to anything we had in mind. 
   As a result, things drifted. Some may say that was simply too bad. Here are people with intractable views, demagogs. Whatever was happening in Yugoslavia was miserable and unfortunate for those people, and especially for their neighbors, our European allies. But that was their problem--and perhaps it was. But late in the game, Europeans came to us and said: We cannot solve it. It is insoluble without the United States. 
   We might have said, ``Tough luck. You are on your own. This is what you wanted. You made your bed, now sleep in it.'' 
   We could have said that. We could have watched the unraveling of various parts of Europe as refugees and economic difficulties and aggression proceeded. But we took a different view--I think the correct view--namely, we are the leaders in NATO. NATO was relevant to that situation. 
   That was a big step but not all Senators agreed. The point being made in the amendment offered by the distinguished Senator from West Virginia and the distinguished Senator from Virginia is that we have not gone to war very often. We have declared war even less. It is time to stop these informal arrangements in which we get involved in operations without having an up-or-down vote or authorization to spend money or send the troops. 
   That is a good point. I can remember arguing before the Desert Storm war that we ought to do that, and there was great anxiety in the White House about any such vote for fear it might come out badly that Saddam Hussein, therefore, would have a free ride. Ultimately, the vote was very close. 
   I understand the constitutional point very well. It could very well be that historians will argue we misplayed our hand at Rambouillet, that our diplomacy was not as swift as it should have been, that we made threats when we did not understand the military power that would be necessary to make those threats good, and that even having made the threats, we did not have a very good plan once we were tested. I make no apologies for any of what proceeded, but the point is, we finally come back to the fact we are in Europe because it is our security--our security--that is at stake. It could be argued, too, that for the moment the Europeans are not sharing the burden, although they would argue, by this time, that they are shouldering their burden--but that is another debate all by itself. Or they might argue we should not be involved without having up-or-down votes in the Congress on these things in any event, or that many Americans believe we are in Kosovo or in Bosnia purely for humanitarian purposes, not for gut strategic purposes of the United States, but because of ethnic cleansing or refugees or displaced persons. 
   The case will be made that this is not a real war, this is a policing action; it is a structural problem, like that faced by a mayor of a city or police or other situations analogous that can be handled by police, and European policemen rather than American policemen. 
   We keep coming back to this haunting question that President George Bush had to face and then President Bill Clinton when the Europeans said: We cannot make it by ourselves. Ultimately, Europeans might say: We can; we are different now; we have new institutions--whether they be security or economic--and you Americans can go home; we can get along without you; it's been nice to have you around. 
   That is not what they are saying. As a matter of fact, every European statesman who comes to Washington--and the Chair presides over these coffees in our Foreign Relations Committee--we hear every single foreign minister and defense minister vowing how important it is the United States is there, stays there, stays there big, how we must take the lead and help organize the situation. We may say in our impatience: Will they never be able to pull it together? Perhaps not in our lifetime. 
   What are the consequences if we leave? The consequence is the same one the German foreign minister told us this week. We left after the First World War. As a matter of fact, throughout the 1930s, we were not only isolationists, we were glad we were not close to the action, and we suffered for that. We lost a lot of lives. We had a war around the world that was touch and go for some time because we were not prepared to do the difficult work, the tedious work, the actual intervention day by day, the grimy, grubby work of diplomacy country by country, case by case. That is the problem. 
   Duty in Kosovo, duty in Bosnia is not a popular assignment for anybody and never will be. I can think of various other places in Europe in which it is not going to be very pleasant. Yet to keep the peace for over 50 years, to have prosperity for them and for us, to make a difference in terms of stability of the world, that counts for something. 
   On the cheap, we can say, by and large, we did not vote for it, we are tired of paying too much for it. Europeans understand that a little bit, and I give credit to the distinguished Senator from Virginia for trying to urge them to step up to the plate, and they have now demonstrated they are paying more than 85 percent--the lion's share--whether it is the policing side or the economic side, and that we are paying 15 percent, and that is about what we 
    agreed to do. 
   They said, in essence: You fought most of the war, we will pick up five-sixths of the cost. That may or may not be a good agreement, but that is roughly where we have come to in Kosovo. We could say we are tired of paying the 15 percent and, as a matter of fact, our 5,000 or 6,000 troops are tired of being there and, as a Senate, we are tired of debating the issue. We would just like to get a vote on this and get rid of it cleanly. Tell the President, whoever he is, where to go in this situation. It makes no difference whether we have a Secretary of State negotiating over there or not, we know better because we represent the people and we have the power of the purse and we can jerk this thing out immediately. 
   Some will argue whether or not to do that as a matter of fact. The vote would not come for a year. General Clark has testified to this in the letter the distinguished Senator from Michigan just read, that other countries will make their own calculations. We, frankly, do not know what the foreign policy of President Putin of Russia will be. We suspect, as a matter of fact, as we have heard from the Russian Ambassador and from others that the Russians want a zone in Kosovo, maybe ours. Let's say we withdraw and the Russians say: It would be fine, as a matter of fact, if we were there because we could help integrate the Serbs as they want to come back to their homes, or help with a little bridge there; that would be a good thing in terms of integration of Europe as we see it; and we are here as Russians; the Americans have gone home; they were tired of this, tired of the policing action and all the burdens, all the difficulties. That is one possibility. 
   President Milosevic might say: Let's be at ease for a year, wait it out. Kosovo was sort of a contretemps, a bad nightmare. A good many bombs were dropped around the country, there was some difficulties with the power stations and difficulties in terms of  deprivation, but, by and large, that is in the past, and in a year's time, we can be home free. We can begin to operate business as usual. 
   The Albanians noting the situation likewise say: We have a year to prepare for the war to take on the Serbs who are back with perhaps the help of Russian friends and others who come in to fill this vacuum. 
   European allies will be accused frequently of withdrawing people from the country. They will say, by and large, the Americans are a strange leader; they are gone. This is the only war NATO ever fought and some may feel the only one it ever will fight because there was not very much leadership here, not much standing to talk to us about whether we have an independent force, whether it is with NATO or anybody else. 
   We have a very fateful vote coming up, and it comes right to the point we are discussing today: multinational organizations and particularly NATO, the most important security alliance, because Europe counts. 
   I suggest we do reaffirm NATO. 
   As a matter of fact, as the distinguished Senator from Kansas pointed out, I suggested last year at the NATO celebration that we consider carefully new members. There were nine applicants. I say it is imperative that we keep hope alive for all nine. That is the incentive for their reform and for the courage to continue on. 
   As a matter of fact, I hope we will move to adopt new members. I hope we will offer leadership to fill out much more substantially those who have fought for freedom, those who have a lot at stake in the kind of Europe we think would be more secure for them and for us. 
   I think we ought to be devoting more resources to NATO rather than less. It seems to me we have a golden opportunity. Historically, we have been established there for a long time. To abandon or weaken NATO at this point, or to give hints we are going to abandon it, or to give hints that it can be taken for granted, would be an unfortunate policy. 
   By the same token, this debate gives us an opportunity to finally establish, once and for all the question: Does Europe count? Do we care? Can Europe make it without us? I believe it counts. I do not think they can make it without us. I think we have to be there. And if we are going to be there, we ought to lead, and we ought to have the resources that make it count. We ought to expand the operation, as a matter of fact. We ought to be assertive and bold as opposed to timidly pulling back into our tent. 
   I believe that is what the debate ought to be about. It ought to be about the strength of the very best multinational organization we have, about the reasons our allies are important to us, and what we intend to do about it. 
   I thank the Chair for the opportunity to give this address. 
   I thank the distinguished Senators from Georgia and Kansas, again, for inviting me to be a part of the colloquy.

    Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, last week, in a EUCOM change of command ceremony, General Wesley Clark relinquished his position as Supreme Allied Commander Europe, concluding one of his generation's most illustrious and eventful military careers. As he testifies before the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence today, I want to highlight the contributions of General Clark to the national security of the United States and to its friends and allies in Europe and around the globe, and thank him for his service to NATO as Supreme Allied Commander Europe. 
   As NATO Secretary General Lord Robertson put it: Wes Clark has been the right man, in the right place, at the right time. He has been instrumental in bringing a degree of stability to Bosnia-Herzegovina, so that efforts at reconstruction and reconciliation could proceed. General Clark welcomed three new members to the Alliance and has worked tirelessly to integrate them fully--militarily and politically--into the activities and decision-making processes of the Alliance. The General has worked to turn the Partnerships for Peace into stepping stones rather than alternatives to Alliance membership, and he has kept the door open to new entrants, while setting forth high military standards for full integration. 
   But nowhere have General Clark's political and leadership qualities been more evident than during NATO's Kosovo campaign. Having been a key participant in diplomatic efforts seeking a solution to Yugoslavia's ethnic turmoil and disintegration, General Clark changed hats without missing a beat and assumed command of the Alliance strategy to complement diplomacy with military power. General Clark's steadfast pursuit of military victory coupled with the maintenance of political cohesion in Alliance planning cells at NATO Headquarters brought the Western coalition to one of its finest hours in its 50-year history. 
   Equally important, General Clark recognized that military success could not produce peace, prosperity and stability on the ground without an effective civil implementation program that allowed the peoples of the Balkans the tools to address their historical grievances toward one another. He knew that the political unity he helped to forge as a prerequisite to military success must now be sustained and strengthened if the civilianization process is to succeed. 
   Secretary of Defense Cohen put it well at the EUCOM Change of Command ceremony last week in Europe. He said:  
   In General Wes Clark, America found a scholar, a soldier and a statesman: a scholar of unquestioned courage, a bronze and silver star hero who, despite grievous wounds, inspired his unit to survive in the jungles of Vietnam; a soldier of insight who returned to train those who prevailed in Desert Storm. He is a statesman whose influence has been felt from the Americas where he helped to guide the fight against drug barons to Dayton where his counsel helped end the bloodletting in Bosnia.  
   Those sentiments are shared by those of us in the Senate who have benefitted from General Clark's wise counsel over the years. He was never too busy for one more briefing at NATO Headquarters or in the field. When the relevant committees held their hearings, General Clark was on the plane so that he might address Congressional concerns across the table, not across the ocean. 
   Members of both branches of government are now in the process of assimilating the ``lessons learned'' from the Kosovo campaign. General Clark has recently completed his own ``after action'' report. But for the United States, there is one incontrovertible lesson to be learned: If the history of the last year or so in the Balkans were to repeat itself, the United States and the Alliance would be well served by having Wes Clark again at the helm of a coalition of nations intent on defending their common interests.

   Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I have an amendment to the Elementary and Secondary Education Act Reauthorization bill. My amendment would increase the authorization for the Comprehensive School Reform Program from $200 million to $500 million. I believe that there are few areas of this bill that can have a more positive impact on education in American than the Comprehensive School Reform Program. 
   Educators in this country are trying hard to improve the success of their schools. Teachers, administrators, and parents routinely organize and staff tutorial programs, remedial classes, after-school programs, and innumerable other initiatives designed to bolster school performance. But in most cases, achieving breakthrough results requires research-based reform that embraces innovation and instills discipline in both the children and the methods of the schools. 
   School-wide reform programs effectively implemented through the hard work of administrators, teachers, and parents have transformed many struggling schools. Unfortunately, some schools--especially poorer Title I schools--lack the means to pay for these programs. The Comprehensive School Reform Program, CSRP, was established three years ago to help public elementary or secondary schools pay for the initial costs of implementing comprehensive strategies for educational reform. Under CSRP, grants to individual schools are to be at least $50,000 per year (renewable up to three years), in addition to all other federal aid for which they may be eligible. 
   Schools that adopt comprehensive reform plans generally have searched the education landscape for effective methods. They have studied intensively the reform programs that have been developed by educators around the country. And they have chosen the program that they believe will produce the best results in their school. 
   Most schools that adopt a comprehensive reform plan do so based on two premises: first, that significantly improving the performance of their school demands a complete reorientation of its resources, methods, and culture; and second, that the reform plan should be based on a body of sound research and should have a proven record of success.  
   Many reform plans focus on reading, because it is the critical foundation for success in other subjects and in later grades. In most cases, the problems of a student who fails begin early. So must the solutions. We should start by ensuring that all students are able to read by the end of the third grade. Educators widely proclaim that this is a crucial goal. If students have not achieved this standard, they have a very hard time catching up in later grades. The inability to read well handicaps the rest of their studies, and their employment prospects later in life are greatly diminished. In Indiana, as many as a third of all students fall behind by the end of the third grade. Indiana's performance is not unusual--the entire country is failing to meet the challenge of educating all our children. 
   Mr. President, my first elective office was as a member of the Indianapolis Board of School Commissioners in the mid-1960s. At that time, our school board struggled with basic questions of 
   improvements in educational standards, desegregation of schools, and getting children proper nutrition and immunizations. Since that time, as a mayor and as a Senator, I have followed closely the development of education in America. In some areas we have done well. In other areas, our progress has been disappointing. 
   But during that time, few developments have encouraged me as much as the advances in comprehensive school reform. There are many reform programs achieving positive results. But to illustrate the concept, I would like to describe one in particular. This is ``Success for All,'' which was developed by Dr. Robert Slavin at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore. Success for All is a great idea that has proven its value in many schools across the country, including 13 in Indiana. 
   Reading is serious business at a Success for All school. For 90 minutes each day, students are grouped by their reading ability rather than their grade level. This allows students who excel at reading to progress at their own rate, while ensuring that students who fall behind will receive intensive attention to stimulate their progress. To set the tone and importance of the reading period, students proceed silently and purposefully through the hall to their reading group classroom. 
   Once the period begins, there is a rapid-fire of sequential lessons. Each segment is short enough to maintain the interest and attention of even the most distracted student. The lessons are fun but rigorously structured. Teachers read a story. Then students are involved in reading the words to the story in unison, discussing the story with a partner, then answering questions to test comprehension. At the completion of a successful lesson segment, students choose one of many group cheers. This positive reinforcement both encourages children, and fosters group cooperation. 
   During the reading period, every staff person in the school is involved in reading. The art teacher or gym teacher may be tutors, for example. Parents also agree to have their children read to them for 20 minutes each night. If this doesn't happen, adults are available to work with the students during the morning school breakfast period. 
   Because Success for All depends on the commitment of the entire faculty and because it requires such a fundamental change in the way a school operates, Dr. Slavin requires that at least 80 percent of the faculty must approve Success for All by secret ballot. 
   The discipline and accountability of the program greatly reduce the possibility that students will fail. If a student falls behind, tutoring sessions are set up to get the student caught up. By teaching children to read in the early grades, our schools can avoid holding students back, promoting them with insufficient ability or transferring them out of the normal curriculum to special education courses. Referrals to special education in Success for All schools have been shown to decrease by approximately 50 percent. In schools where Success for All is taught, students learn to read by the third grade. By the fifth grade, students in these schools are testing a full grade level ahead of students in other schools. 
   I would strongly encourage each of my colleagues to visit a Success for All school, if they have not already done so. I have had the pleasure of visiting Maplewood Elementary School in Wayne Township, Marion County, Washington Elementary in Gary, and Fairfield Elementary in Fort Wayne, which has had Success for All since 1995. In my judgment, anyone who sees Success for All in action will become a believer. I have contacted every school district in my state to suggest that they take a look at Success for All or another comprehensive school reform program based on rigorous research. 
   Mr. President, the amendment I am offering today would allow more struggling schools to adopt comprehensive school reform programs. These programs are a comparative bargain for our schools and our children when one considers their success at preventing the enormous costs of retention, special education and illiteracy. But many schools need help paying for the start-up costs and the reading materials associated with comprehensive reform programs. 
   Most of the more than 1,500 schools nationwide that use Success for All fund it with the Federal Title I program. Others have tapped private sources. But increasing funding for the Comprehensive School Reform Program is the most direct way to give more local schools the chance to embrace school-wide reform and transform the lives of their students. The program deserves more support because its positive impact on literacy and the ultimate success of students is so demonstrable. 
   Each child must learn to read. The quality of life for that child depends upon that single achievement, as does the economic future of our country. I ask my colleagues to support this amendment.

   Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senator DASCHLE in introducing the Renewable Fuels Act of 2000. 
   In July 1999, an independent Blue Ribbon Panel on Oxygenates in Gasoline called for major reductions in the use of MTBE as an additive in gasoline. They did so because of growing evidence and public concerns regarding pollution of drinking water supplies by MTBE. These trends are particularly acute in areas of the country using Reformulated Gasoline. 
   The Reformulated Gasoline Program (RFG) has proven to be a success in reducing smog and has exceeded expectations in reducing dangerous and carcinogenic air toxics in gasoline. The second stage of the Reformulated Gasoline Program (RFG) will commence this summer and will have an even greater effect in reducing ozone pollution and air toxics. 
   Because of concerns regarding water pollution, it is clear that the existing situation regarding MTBE is not tenable. The Governor of California has called for a three year phase out of MTBE in California and the California Air Resources Board has adopted regulations to that effect. Environmental officials from eight Northeastern States have proposed a phase down and a capping of the use of MTBE in gasoline in their states. MTBE is being found in wells in the Midwest even in areas that do not use reformulated gasoline. 
   The Renewable Fuels Act of 2000 will lead to about five billion gallons of ethanol being produced in 2010 compared to one billion, six hundred million gallons today. Under the Act, one gallon of cellulosic ethanol will count for one and one-half gallons of regular ethanol in determining whether a refiner has met the Renewable Fuels Standard in a particular year. 
   We are going to have spikes in oil that will disrupt our economy. It may or may not be able to be controlled. It will happen before 2010. It may happen again next week. Our problem in terms of national security and the security of our whole economy revolves around our dependence on petroleum-based fuels. We must be able to address this challenge. Finding an environmentally sensitive way to resolve the MTBE crisis is an important part of this challenge. 
   It is clear that MTBE is on its way out. The question is what kind of legislation is needed to facilitate its departure and whether that legislation will be based on consideration of all of the environmental and energy and national security issues involved. 
   The Renewable Fuels Act of 2000 will establish a nationwide Renewable Fuels Standard (RFS) that would increase the current use of renewable fuels from 1.3% in 2000 to 3.3% by 2010. Refiners who produced renewable fuels beyond the standard could sell credits to other refiners who chose to under comply with the RFS. 
   This bill would give the EPA Administrator authority to limit or eliminate the use of MTBE in order to protect the public health and the environment. It also gives states the ability to further regulate or eliminate MTBE use if the EPA does not choose to eliminate it. It would also establish strict ``anti backsliding provisions'' to capture all of the air quality benefits of MTBE and ethanol as MTBE is phased down or phased out. 
   The Renewable Fuels Act of 2000 will be good for our economy and our environment. Most important of all, it will facilitate the development of renewable fuels, a development critical to ensuring U.S. national and economic security and stabilizing gas prices. 
   I hope that my colleagues will examine this bill as well as other legislative approaches that would spur the development of renewable fuels such as ethanol, whether derived from corn or other agricultural or plant materials.

    Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I am pleased to have this opportunity to recognize one of my constituents, Mr. James Kelley of Fort Wayne, Indiana, for his humanitarian work in the country of Moldova. 
   Moldova is a small country located between Ukraine and Romania. Throughout the Cold War it was a part of the Soviet Union but recently gained its independence from the USSR on August 27, 1991. The United States has supported Moldova in its journey toward democracy and sovereignty. 
   I met with Moldovan President Petru Lucinschi last year in Washington. We discussed some of the challenges facing the newly independent Moldova. Our meeting revolved around U.S. security assistance including counter-proliferation training, efforts to combat organized crime and border security training. We also discussed our cooperation to prevent the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. The United States and Moldova have enjoyed a positive  track record of cooperation, and I am hopeful that this relationship will continue. 
   Of the many challenges for this new country, two of the most pressing are economic growth and the health of the Moldovan people. In an effort to create economic growth in the region, Mr. Kelley established a grain business in Moldova's farm communities. With a purchase of a grain elevator he provided opportunity for many farmers to market their crops. This effort to bolster a local economy will assist in relieving the financial burden many families face in these rural communities. 
   In an effort to address the pressing health care needs of this nation, Mr. Kelley recently led a group of Fort Wayne area health professionals to Moldova. The team of trained physicians, nurses and health care professionals performed necessary surgeries, administered treatments, delivered medical equipment, supplies and medicines to the Republican Hospital in Chisinau. 
   I commend Mr. Kelley for his energy and commitment to helping the people of Moldova. His leadership and selfless dedication to helping others have made a difference in this small country. 
   Good relationships between the United States and former Soviet republics, such as Moldova, enhance the security of the United States. I am pleased to recognize the contributions of a fellow Hoosier in this important effort.

   Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Health Care Infrastructure Investment Act. 
   Formerly arcane statistics of interest only to economists, productivity and innovation are now veritable buzz-words in today's much-heralded new economy. Recently released productivity figures drew front page coverage from both the Washington Post and New York Times. Most economists, including Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, attribute the surge in productivity to technological improvements. A host of new and improved technologies, including faster computers and rapid expansion of the Internet, have led to improved efficiencies. The result: workers are more productive, companies continue to grow and wealth is created. 
   Today nearly every industrial sector is involved in a race to apply new technology and management techniques to gain greater efficiencies. Yet one sector that accounts for 13 percent of America's gross domestic product--health care--still uses a patchwork-quilt of outdated technology for the most basic of its transactions. 
   While individual components within the health industry are adopting advanced communication, manufacturing and other technologies but the inner core of health care--a series of transactions between doctor, patient and insurance provider--remains largely untouched by technological advances that would decrease the administrative load accompanying every transaction. 
   At a time when America's growing population is seeking a higher quality of care; when the greying of America means that Medicare enrollment will double by 2040; when new medical procedures are being developed that hold great promise for the treatment and cure of diseases like cancer and AIDS; when prescription drugs are becoming available that extend and improve the quality of life--we have every motivation for adopting into health care some  of the same technologies and ideas responsible for transforming other sectors of the American economy. 
   A robust and modern infrastructure for American health care will enable resources to be shifted to where they are most needed and allow for the dramatic increases in productivity necessary to treat increasing numbers of people at a higher level of care. In this sense, efficiency is not double-speak for additional restrictions placed on the doctor-patient relationship or further regulations on insurance coverage. Instead, greater efficiency means that doctors are free to spend more time treating patients, insurance companies reduce the cost of claims processing and consumers are empowered with a better understanding of treatment and costs. 
   America's interstate highway system is a prime example of a wise infrastructure investment. As a result of a sustained Federal commitment, Americans enjoy an unprecedented degree of mobility while the economy benefits from the low cost and ease of transportation. A similar approach should be applied to health care whose roads for processing information resemble the rutted cobblestone paths of medieval times. 
   The Health Care Infrastructure Investment Act is designed to spur Federal and private sector investment so that a nationwide network of systems is built for health care. A network of systems is a descriptive term that refers to the conglomeration of hardware, software and secure information networks designed to speed the flow of information and capital between doctors, patients and insurance providers. 
   The primary goal of the Health Care Infrastructure Investment Act is to build an advanced infrastructure to efficiently process and handle the vast number of straightforward transactions that now clog the pipeline and drain scarce health care resources. Among the targeted transactions are immediate, point-of-service verification of insurance coverage, point-of-service checking for incomplete or erroneous claim submission and point-of-service resolution of clean claims for doctor office visits including the delivery of an explanation of benefits and payment. 
   When designing a complex system, a first step is to define performance standards that the system must meet. As configured, the legislation mandates broadly defined performance standards for the federally administered Medicare program that will be phased-in over a ten year period. To ensure that improvements in the infrastructure supporting federally-financed health care are matched in the managed care sector, insurers participating in the Federal Employees Health Benefits program 
   will also be required to meet these same performance standards. 
   Also critical will be harnessing the expertise of selection of the Federal agency responsible for the design and implementation of an advanced health care infrastructure. Some of my colleagues have suggested that the Department of Defense or even NASA, two agencies with decades of experience with complex, distributed networks, be assigned a leadership role. Accordingly, the legislation forms a Health Care Infrastructure Commission, chaired by the Secretary of Health and Human Services, and composed of senior officials from NASA, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, the National Science Foundation, the Office of Science and Technology Policy and the Department of Veterans Affairs. Officials named to the Health Care Infrastructure Commission are required to be expert in advanced information technology. 
   The legislation also strives to create a strong partnership with the private sector, as many of the advances in communication technology are driven by companies, both large and small. 
   Many pieces of a truly advanced health care infrastructure already exist. But like a modern-day Tower of Babel, communication is hindered by differences in language and function. Sorely needed is a combination of vision and commitment: vision to design a system that is secure, efficient and flexible and the commitment to dedicate necessary intellectual and financial resources for its design and implementation. 
   America has put a man on the moon, designed advanced stealth fighters and is now enjoying a sustained period of economic expansion stimulated by electronic devices, telephone and Internet. We must now develop and build a health care infrastructure that checks insurance status with the swipe of a card, provides speedy payment to doctors for their expertise in healing and allows a patient to leave the doctor's office with a single statement of treatment and cost. I am confident that we will succeed. 
   I urge my colleagues to support the Health Care Infrastructure Investment Act.

   Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I commend the distinguished Senator from Minnesota for his amendment. On our side of the aisle, we are hopeful that Members will vote for the amendment. 
   I simply add, we do hear loudly and clearly the voices of those who participated in the rally for rural America. This very day, the Senate will take action, we believe, to at least answer a part of the problem of a strong safety net for the income of farmers in our country. Indeed, $6 billion of taxpayer resources will be devoted, given Budget Committee action, to the safety net for our producers in the event we take timely action. I stress the timely aspect of that. 
   As all Senators note, we have tried very hard, working with the distinguished ranking member, Senator HARKIN, with the cooperation of Senator WELLSTONE, concerning those who have pioneered this effort--Senator ROBERTS, Senator KERREY, and others--to bring about something I hope will be almost unanimous.

   Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I rise today in support of H.R. 5, the Senior Citizens' Freedom to Work Act. The passage of this legislation is long overdue. The Social Security earnings test is bad for our economy and bad for individual senior Americans who wish to  continue in the workforce. I am extremely pleased that the Senate is moving to eliminate the earnings test. 
   I am hopeful, however, that passage of this bill will not mark the end of thoughtful policy regarding the role of seniors in the American workforce. Senior workers are an invaluable resource for our nation. As the number of Americans of retirement age increases, the economy's need for senior workers will inevitably increase as well. We should encourage those seniors who wish to continue working by making certain that they are treated fairly by tax and retirement laws. 
   Too often, government policy toward retirees has assumed that all seniors have the same needs, goals, and desires. Mr. President, each individual is different. Many seniors look forward to a leisurely retirement that allows them to pursue activities for which they did not have time when they were working. American seniors have earned this option, and trends over the last several decades that demonstrate the average senior is enjoying a healthier and more prosperous retirement are extremely encouraging. 
   But other senior Americans wish to delay retirement for as long as possible. Many seniors who have communicated with me about this subject simply enjoy the stimulation that a workplace provides on a daily basis. Others are not ready to leave businesses or farms that they have spent their entire lives building. Still others wish to continue to contribute to the income of their families, children, or grandchildren. Regardless of their reasons for wanting to stay in the workplace, no senior should find that government policy is a disincentive or barrier to work. 
   In addition to ensuring basic fairness to individuals, providing further incentives to senior workers makes good sense for our economy. Seniors who stay in the workforce continue to pay taxes on their earnings and continue to provide much-needed experience to the American economy. As our economy grows and the baby-boom generation approaches retirement age, we may experience more frequent labor shortages. Ultimately, a declining number of qualified workers could be detrimental to the economy. Adding incentives that reward older Americans for staying in the workforce could help alleviate such shortages while continuing to improve our economy and standard of living. 
   Last month, with the support of Senators BREAUX and GREGG, I introduced two pieces of legislation that would encourage American seniors to stay in the workforce. 
   These bills, entitled the Retired Americans Right of Employment Acts (RARE I and RARE II), are based on the premise that many seniors want to work and their labor is invaluable to our economy and society. Both bills would repeal the earnings test, as we are seeking to do today. But they would go further by implementing specific tax and benefit changes that would reward seniors who choose to work. 
   Among other provisions, both bills would phase in a formula allowing income earned after the retirement age to be counted in the calculation of an individual's Social Security benefits. Currently, Social Security benefits for most people are based on the average of the top 35 earning years prior to age 62. Allowing income earned after age 62 to be included in benefit calculations would increase the benefits of those seniors who choose to continue working. 
   The two bills offer alternative methods to reduce the taxes of working seniors. RARE I would cut the FICA tax of seniors by 10 percent when they reach full retirement age. As a result, retirees would see their FICA tax reduced from 7.65 percent of their paycheck to 6.885 percent. Because taxes are levied on the first dollar of wages earned, this tax reduction would benefit all income levels of retirees, including those who choose to work part-time.

   Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, 
    today we will debate a matter of special significance and timeliness to agriculture producers throughout the United States, and that is the subject of risk management legislation. 
   During many full committee hearings, a public roundtable and hundreds  of hours of research and public discussion spanning the past year, members of the Senate Agriculture Committee have engaged in active deliberation, considering a host of options in providing risk management assistance to our Nation's farmers. 
   The task has been formidable. Variances in agriculture production, regional considerations of weather patterns, and different perspectives on farm management have contributed to a most complex and yet beneficial discussion. 
   The foundation of our efforts was section 204 of the Concurrent Resolution on the Budget for fiscal year 2000. Six billion dollars was provided over a 4-year period commencing October 1, 2000 for agricultural risk management. The basic rationale was that farm producers could take action to minimize risk, including severe market price fluctuations, and therefore render emergency recovery legislation less necessary. 
   My colleagues Senator GRASSLEY and Senator CONRAD played a major role in the Budget Committee's action on risk management and have advocated crop insurance legislation offered by Senator ROBERTS and Senator KERREY that would increase Federal subsidies for crop insurance premium payments to make Federal crop and revenue insurance policies more affordable for farmers, particularly at the higher levels of coverage. 
   In recent months, I suggested that risk management strategy involves more than crop insurance. Cash-forward contracts, hedging contracts, reduction of farm debt, diversification of crops, conservation, and substantial capital land improvements are important risk management tools also available to farmers, and hopefully will be utilized by farmers. 
   As a result of our extended debate on risk management matters in the Senate Agriculture Committee, more producers are aware or at least reminded of the risk management tools available to them. I am grateful for the support so many have shown to my initiative. 
   Nevertheless, on March 2 of this year the Senate Agriculture Committee acted and approved legislation, principally the legislation offered by Senators ROBERTS and KERREY, that over the next 4 years recommends $6 billion for improving and strengthening the Federal Crop Insurance Program, beginning with the 2001 crop. Included in the bill is a pilot program providing $500 million in direct risk management assistance to farmers who choose to forego crop insurance subsidies in a particular year. 
   A producer would receive a risk management payment for utilizing 2 out of 12 risk management options. The legislation also raises premium subsidies to make Federal crop and revenue insurance policies more affordable for farmers, particularly at the higher levels of coverage. The bill eases actual production history so that farmer insurance coverage is less likely to be artificially suppressed by successive years of bad weather; encourages the development of insurance coverage for specialty crops and revenue insurance on a whole farm rather than a commodity-by-commodity basis; it eliminates requirements of the area-wide loss before disaster payments can be made to producers of currently noninsurable crops; and it reduces the potential for insurance fraud and abuse with strong program compliance provisions. 
   In my judgment, it is very important that the Senate act favorably and promptly on this legislation. It will provide an important safety net component for agricultural producers. 
   Let me mention a practical example of how crop insurance works in my own situation. There may be others in this body who have been purchasers of crop insurance on their farm. The Senator from Iowa, Mr. GRASSLEY, comes to mind. I have utilized crop insurance on my farm. Let me suggest to the Chair the crop insurance that is now available to farmers may insure the yield; that is, take a look at your farm and try to make certain that the yield you believe you would normally get is going to be there through insurance, or at least as great a percentage of that as possible you can insure, and for a premium price you can insure that yield. Or farmers can insure the revenue that might come from yield and price and take out a policy that might cover that situation. Farmers can do both--yield and revenue. 
   There have been in the past catastrophic insurance policies. They contemplated the loss of over half of the crop. A while back, such insurance was required. The requirement was relieved by the farm bill of 1996. This is available to farmers to guarantee income to them, regardless of the weather or other hazards that might come from nature; likewise, hazards that might come from loss of exports as it affects the revenue that comes from that farm. 
   To take a very practical example, last Friday I was in a situation where I was able to make a sale of 2,000 bushels of corn from my farm to a grain elevator in Indiana. A commonsense person would ask: But you haven't planted the crop yet; where did you get the corn to make a forward contract, a promise, to deliver 2,000 bushels of corn? I promised to deliver that corn in March of 2001, and I will receive $2.57 a bushel for that corn. 
   For me, that was a significant contract. That may not be the top of the market, but I point out that in our debates on agricultural pricing last year, the Chair will recall some debaters pointed out that the price of corn had fallen to $1.70 a bushel. Many pointed out that effectively there was a floor through the loan deficiency payment of about $1.96 for corn farmers throughout the country. That was the minimum price for corn in most sections of our country. The current cash price for corn in some elevators around the country is somewhere between $2.10 to $2.15, as of March, if you are going to deliver. 
   I mention this to give some benchmarks. Mr. President, $2.57 is obviously much higher than the floor of $1.96 which would still prevail in the current crop we are speaking about, much higher than the current cash price. That is, obviously, far higher than journalistic accounts of how far the price of corn fell last year. 
   I was able to make that sale because I have crop insurance. Last year, I took out a 65-percent CRC policy, a crop revenue coverage policy. That particular policy means, in essence, I can take a look at the number of acres I want to plant, the average yield from those acres on my farm. The crop insurance people then take a look at the price of corn in the December futures as reflected for a period of 30 days; they take a look at what happened in the past. In essence, I am guaranteed at least that if I want to I can sell my crop in advance and take bold maneuvers with regard to marketing. 
   That is one of the major purposes of crop insurance. What I have described is a fairly simple device used by most farmers; namely, a forward contract, based upon the fact you have something to sell and based upon the fact the price for corn goes up and down. You can look at futures markets. You can look at the trends and make sales. You are not left to wait for the elevator price at the time the corn comes in. An abundant harvest sometimes puts corn and other grains on the ground because elevators cannot handle it or railway cars cannot take it away. 
   I mention this because crop insurance is obviously an extremely vital part not only of a safety net to make sure farmers are going to have a substantial amount of income but as a part of marketing strategy. As a part of this debate, we have talked about marketing strategies because they are going to be required for most farmers in America to make a profit and to do well enough to support their families. It will not work for farmers to plant, as they always have planted, whatever does well on their land, and to hope that the price will be high at the time of harvest. As a rule, price is low at the time of harvest. Unless there is a marketing strategy, farmers do not maximize their income, and many are not doing very well. 
   This is a very important part of the 1996 farm bill legislation. As my colleague, Senator ROBERTS, has pointed out during his chairmanship of the House Agriculture Committee, this is a part of the picture that was never completely filled in. We have an opportunity to do that today. 
   The bill Senator ROBERTS, Senator KERREY, and their staffs have researched, and which I support, calls for higher possible percentages. I spoke of a 65-percent policy which I took out last year, but higher percentages are  possible. Of course, that means higher premiums. 
   The bill before the Senate lessens those premiums to farmers by offering a much stronger subsidy. There is a certain inversion of the subsidies. By that I mean, if farmers reach out for more safety, farmers receive more support from this bill. The point is to try to persuade farmers to take seriously the safety net provided by crop insurance risk management tools. 
   This bill goes a long way to offering those incentives. 
   Let me take, once again, a concrete example anecdotally from my own situation last year. The premium for my crop insurance on my corn crop was $1,700, quoted by the crop insurance salesman out in Indiana. Ultimately, I paid about $700-plus. The subsidy to the policy was about $1,000. That is a very strong inducement to take crop insurance seriously. 
   In my home State of Indiana last year, approximately 44 percent of farmers did take crop insurance seriously, although many at much lower levels--some at simply the catastrophic level, at a very low premium. Therefore, even after we pass this legislation, which I hope we will do, and confer with the House--they have passed legislation that is very similar to this--and enact this so it comes into force prior to the fiscal year that begins the first of October, each one of us will have an obligation to visit with our farmers, to visit with the extension offices of our agricultural universities and others, to explain the possibilities that are there for risk management for a very large safety net provided in the farm bill and provided by the Budget Committee for these next 4 years. 
   This is an extraordinary opportunity. We owe it not only to the country to pass legislation, but we owe it to our farmers to make sure our advocacy reaches a new level of information and education about very constructive legislation. 
   I yield the floor for my distinguished ranking member of the Agriculture Committee. In due course, I know Senator ROBERTS will want to be heard, and should be heard, and Senator KERREY, who have been largely responsible for fashioning portions of this bill.

   Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, let me say that I appreciate very much the words of the Senator from Minnesota. I think his tribute to the farmers who came is certainly appropriate and very moving. The Senator has obviously worked to make certain that meeting was constructively successful. I assure the Senator that the voices in the meeting have been heard and, clearly, we were prepared to move on this legislation. But it is a part of the action that we must take to provide a stronger safety net. I feel that we will do so today. I am confident we will move this bill appropriately. 
   Very clearly, there is much more we need to do. I say to the Senator from Minnesota and my colleague from North Dakota that I know from the income on my own farm last year that it was down. It was down the year before from the year before that. I suspect I am one of the few Members who keeps the books, who tries to settle with the family members. I understand prices and difficulties. I am looking at this from the standpoint of a 604-acre farm, and that is not untypical of many farms in my State and the Senator's State. Our problems are profound but not beyond solution. I look forward to working with the Senator. 
   At this moment, I am prepared to say on our side we accept the amendment, and we certainly want to see it approved by acclamation. Before I make a further comment on that, may I take a moment to say that I am hopeful that the distinguished Senator from Massachusetts, Mr. KENNEDY, is approaching the floor, and likewise, the Senator from Wisconsin, Mr. KOHL, who have statements or amendments for which time has been provided, so we might proceed. 
   I have received word from the majority leader that he proposes that any rollcall votes that might occur with reference to this legislation happen tomorrow morning. At some point, he will be offering a unanimous consent request or make an announcement that would be appropriate on that point. So I am hopeful we will have further debate soon. But for the moment I commend the Senator and I indicate support on our side. I hope his amendment will be taken by acclamation and with praise.

   Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, let me simply respond quickly to the very specific points the distinguished Senator has made. Hunger relief continues to be a top priority for the Agriculture Committee. That will always be the case. 
   One priority should be that States should have the flexibility they need to determine how vehicles are counted under the Food Stamp Program since States know best about the transportation needs of the families. The Senator has mentioned that is one of the points he has. We strongly commend that idea. We look forward to working with the Senator and with others. 
   I wish to take advantage of this opportunity simply to say that in my own State of Indiana I have been visiting food banks, four very substantial efforts in Indianapolis, Fort Wayne, Evansville, and in Lewisville, serving nine Indiana counties. 
   The reason for my doing that is that the demands for food from these food banks and from the food pantries that they serve have increased very substantially during the last year. This is counterintuitive to many Americans, but not to the Senator from Massachusetts who has highlighted that in his remarks today. 
   In part, it comes because of a transition from welfare to work. A number of individual Americans--and a 7-State survey pointed out--these individuals have, in fact, accepted jobs. A majority of those who were on welfare rolls in Indiana have moved into jobs. But for most of these people, the incomes, on an annual basis, are somewhere in the neighborhood of $10,000 to $15,000. 
   Many have substantial families. They have moved from welfare but not out of poverty. The survey found that 50 percent of these families had extended families. They went, as we would, to their kinfolk. They were able to gain food during desperate periods. The other half essentially went to food banks; thus the increased demand. 
   I have offered a modest piece of legislation, which the Finance Committee is now considering--I hope they will consider it carefully--that further codifies the tax exemption given to companies that already are given an exemption for food contributed to food banks but extends that to partnerships or proprietorships, to individual entrepreneurs, restaurants and others, as well as to farmers and ranchers, many of whom make these generous contributions now. It is in recognition of a very substantial need. There has been great support, at least in my State, for meeting the needs of those who have them. 
   Clearly, reforms of the Food Stamp Program are very important in the same regard and for the same reason--the many Americans who face problems of hunger. The Senator is certainly correct; the distribution problem, the equity problems, are profound. But those are ones we must deal with, and I thank the Senator for taking the floor today for this important colloquy.

   Mr. LUGAR. I fully agree with my friend from Massachusetts that hunger relief needs to be a top priority for the Agriculture Committee, and resources should be found to address the problem. I am especially concerned that states have the flexibility they need to determine how vehicles are counted under the Food Stamp Program, since states know best what transportation families need to work and to safely transport their children.

My understanding is that this is not the first time that the Department of Agriculture would be reviewing fish stocks for crop insurance. In the past, there was concern that wild fish can be too hard to track, and that fisheries managers don't really know when the stocks have failed. However, fisheries managers track fish stocks, especially wild salmon, very closely.

   Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, a beloved gentleman, Herman Wells, the former president of Indiana University, has passed away. We are thoughtful about Herman Wells in our State of Indiana, as are all Americans who were touched by this remarkable man. 
   I have mentioned the legion of Hoosiers who have talked about the profound and inspirational influence of Herman Wells on Indiana University and on individual student lives. Herman Wells made a big difference in my life. He chaired the Indiana Rhodes Scholar Selection Committee in 1953, which included, at the same time, President Fred Hovde of Purdue and Byron Trippett, the president of Wabash. This committee sent me to the scholarship finals in Chicago, where ultimately I was successful. 
   During the past 46 years, I visited frequently with President Wells about that selection committee, about our first meeting. He wrote about it in his memoirs. He has been extraordinarily supportive throughout that period of time in all of my aspirations. 
   I thank President Wells for all the opportunities we had to work together for Indiana University and for my State. I thank him for the extraordinary vision he had for this country. I counted on his counsel and his generous enthusiasm. I will miss him very much, as will all Hoosiers.

    Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I wish to say a few words, and perhaps echo some of those of my colleague. I am proud to sponsor this important piece of legislation with Senator LAUTENBERG. I was a co-sponsor of a similar bill in the last Congress, and am glad to join him again in this effort. I also thank my colleagues Senator DURBIN and Senator CHAFEE for their co-sponsorship of this good policy initiative. 
   Let me start by saying that this bill is about health education and responsible individual decision-making. As Mayor of Indianapolis and in the U.S. Senate, I have advocated good health and fitness. I have integrated running into my daily routine and encourage my staff to do the same. In 1977, I founded the annual Dick Lugar Fitness festival in Indiana, which is an event I look forward to every year. 
   A good health and fitness regimen requires an assumption of personal responsibility and an active role on the part of the individual, but it also requires a knowledge of two essential components of good health--proper diet and exercise. I speak on a regular basis on the exercise component, but would like to make a couple of basic points about proper diet that are well within  the scope of the federal government's responsibilities. 
   We have taken great strides in the area of food packaging and labeling, pointing out to consumers vitamin and fat content; caloric and cholesterol facts. We require data on tests done on artificial sweeteners. But, in a product that threatens the life of one out of three regular users, we ignore those basic principles. 
   Mr. President, we all know that in a food product, the discovery of even a single carcinogen can trigger media attack, consumer outrage and FDA regulation. However, under current law, a cigarette package is not even required to list its ingredients despite the presence of dozens of carcinogens. Applying a simple content labeling standard to tobacco in the interest of consistency and public health is overdue considering the massive health problems inflicted by tobacco. 
   As Chairman of the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry, which has jurisdiction over some aspects of tobacco, I believe that our government must speak consistently and clearly about tobacco's risks. That has not always been the case. In the past, our government has sent mixed messages, for example, subsidizing the cultivation of tobacco and including cigarettes in military rations, even as it warned against tobacco's dangers. If public health warnings are to be trusted, they should not be ambiguous. The small, side-panel warnings currently in use on tobacco packages are not adequate in reflecting the risks of tobacco use as we now know them. We can and we should speak the truth with a clearer voice. 
   Prominent labels on cigarette packages in plain English would be a steady reminder of the risks smokers face when they light up. True, almost every smoker understands that cigarettes are bad for health, but fewer know the degree of risk. 
   Many smokers have tried to quit, some more than once. These labels will encourage them in this endeavor and remind them why they should try again. 
   Most importantly, Mr. President, as Senator LAUTENBERG stated, the warnings will be prominent and readily understood by young Americans, thousands of whom light up for the first time every day. 
   This bill does not interfere with an adult's freedom to choose to smoke, it does not raise tobacco prices, and it does not expand government regulatory authority beyond the labeling requirement. It is a modest and conservative step, but a decisive and important step in good public policy.

   Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I rise to recommend that the Senate pass S. 935. 
   At a time when American farmers and rural communities are having a difficult time making ends meet, it is appropriate for the Senate to support this initiative that holds great promise for agriculture, strengthens America's energy security and helps clean America's air and water while dramatically reducing greenhouse gas emissions. 
   Early civilizations relied on plants and trees for all their energy and food needs. With the passage of time and technological advancement, however, an increasing share of the world's energy demands shifted from plants and trees toward fossil fuels. Time and technology march on, and today we witness the beginning of a revolution from non-renewable fossil fuels toward  renewable resources that can help meet the energy demands of a world now numbering six billion people. Ironically, plants and trees are once again being valued as raw material for energy production because they contain an enormous store of energy freely delivered by the sun. 
   Using nature's renewable raw material for production of needed fuels, chemicals and energy is not a new idea. What is new, however, is a better understanding of chemistry and molecular biology which has led to the development of advanced biotechnologies and processing techniques for efficiently converting plants to energy. With these advances, it is now possible to envisage a future where the world's thirst for additional sources of energy is fueled by biomass. 
   Biobased fuels are our best means of reducing American dependence on imported oil. Reliance on the unstable states of the Middle East adversely impacts American strategic security, and massive oil imports skew our balance of payments. Fuels and chemicals derived from biomass will reduce our dependence on Middle Eastern oil without necessitating a rebuilding of the existing gasoline infrastructure. With the need for affordable energy rising as population grows, the Middle East will control nearly three-quarters of the world's oil this century. We have stark options: submit to increased influence of foreign oil cartels; wrangle over pipeline routes to new oil supplies at the ends of the Earth, such as the Caspian region; or, support research that could lead to a revolution in the way we produce energy. 
   In addition to fuels, biobased chemicals have the potential to replace essentially all chemicals currently derived from petroleum, and they are often endowed with superior performance characteristics. The manufacturing of biobased products is generally more environmentally friendly than analogue petrochemical processes. 
   Fuels, cloth fibers, plastics and adhesives are already produced from corn; the new genetic engineering techniques will make it possible to use entire plants, rather than just the tiny portion of edible grains. With sound land use policies, local crops that enrich the soil, prevent erosion and improve local environmental conditions can be planted and then harvested for co-production of food, fuel, chemicals, electricity and materials. Rural communities will be strengthened through the diversification of marketable agricultural products and farmers will have expanded sources of income. 
   Before we are able to reap the outstanding benefits offered through utilization of America's sustainable biomass resource, costs of the new conversion technology must be significantly reduced. Research offers the only systematic means for creating the innovations and technical improvements that will lower the costs of biomass processing. Given the relatively short-term horizon characteristic of private sector investments, and because many benefits of biomass processing are in the public interest, the Federal government has a compelling mandate to fund the necessary innovation-driven research that will result in cost effective technologies for biomass conversion. 
   Although government sponsored research programs have been largely responsible for demonstrating the potential of biomass conversion technology, coordination among key Federal agencies is disjointed and funding levels are declining. The Biomass Research and Development Act is designed to address these shortcomings. America's leading technical experts from universities, national laboratories and the private sector will be brought together in a dynamic research initiative with the purpose of overcoming technical barriers to low cost biomass conversion. 
   At a time when political compromise seems elusive and progress on environmental and energy issues often seems slow, I am convinced that the idea of encouraging human ingenuity to create a sustainable resource for clean fuels and chemicals represents a remarkable opportunity for consensus. Working together we can promote research that will improve our national security and balance of payments, reduce greenhouse gas emissions and strengthen rural economies. 
   Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to thank Dr. Joseph Michels, my science policy adviser, for the excellent advice he has provided me on this issue. Dr. Michels is leaving my staff to assume an important post at Princeton University. I shall miss him. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this bill.

I want to inform my colleague that any action taken by the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry in relation to S. 935 is not an attempt to encroach on the jurisdiction of the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources. Further, the fact that S. 935 was reported from the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry does not affect the jurisdiction of the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources over energy matters, including biofuels and bioenergy. Specifically, USDA biomass research and development programs remain within the jurisdiction of the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry and DOE biomass research and development programs remain within the jurisdiction of the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.

   Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Hunger Relief Tax Incentive Act. The United States is experiencing one of the greatest economic expansions in our nation's history. Our country is in the enviable position of experiencing both strong growth and record low unemployment and inflation. 
   Unfortunately, some families have not shared in this rising economic tide. Last year, America's Second Harvest food banks, our nation's largest hunger relief network, provided food assistance to 26 million needy people. 
   Food banks and other charities are finding it increasingly difficult to meet all of the demand for food assistance. Nearly 1 million needy and hungry people were turned away from food banks last year for a lack of food, according to Second Harvest. Statistics by the United States Department of Agriculture show that up to 96 billion pounds of food goes to waste each year in the United States. If a small percentage of that food could be captured and directed to food banks, significantly more food would be available to those in need. 
   In the past, food banks have gained donations from the inefficiencies of manufacturing. Producing blemished product or manufacturing too much merchandise has provided charities with a steady flow of donations. However, technology has made businesses and manufacturers significantly more efficient. Although beneficial to the company's bottom-line, donations have lessened as a result. Furthermore, the advent of a seconds market, including dollar and value stores, has created additional demand for these over-produced or cosmetically flawed products, placing another strain on this source of food donations. 
   As Chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee, I realize the important assistance provided through federal nutrition programs. During the debate on welfare reform, I fought for our nation's school lunch program, opposing the block granting of such funds in order to ensure that low income children received at least one nutritious meal a day. I also fought successfully to maintain food stamps as an entitlement to ensure access to nutritious food for the nation's poor. In 1997, Congressman Lee Hamilton and I sponsored and passed legislation that gave charities that serve the poor preferential access to surplus federal property. The Hunger Relief Tax Incentive bill I am introducing today will complement these efforts and spur private donations of food products to food banks and soup kitchens around the country. 
   Under current tax law, when a corporation donates food to a food bank, it is eligible to receive a ``special rule'' tax deduction. Congress created the ``special rule'' deduction in the Tax Reform Act of 1976 to provide a special incentive for the donation of food to charities that serve the poor. The ``special rule'' deduction allows a company to deduct the cost (or basis) of the donated product and up to 1/2 the mark-up of the product's fair market value. This deduction is capped to not exceed twice the cost basis. 
   Unfortunately, when the ``special rule'' deduction is applied to most donations, companies have found that they do not even recoup their actual production costs. Moreover, current tax law limits the ``special rule'' deduction to corporations, thus disallowing farmers, ranchers, small businesses and restaurant owners from receiving the same tax benefits afforded to corporate donors. 
   The Hunger Relief Tax Incentive Act will encourage additional food donations with three changes to our current law. First, this bill will extend these favorable tax incentives now afforded only to corporate donors of food to all business taxpayers. That means farmers, ranchers, small business and restaurant owners will benefit through tax incentives for their donations of food to hungry people in their own community. 
   Second, this legislation will enlarge the tax deduction for donated food to the fair market value of the product, not to exceed twice the product's cost (basis). Although most companies will continue to recoup less than the entire cost of production, the enhanced deduction from the donation and the resulting heightened good-will makes donating food a more economically sound proposition. 
   Lastly, this bill will codify the Tax Court ruling in ``Lucky Stores, Inc. v. IRS''. In that case, the Court upheld the right of the taxpayer to determine the fair market value of donated food, rather than the IRS. I agree that taxpayers are in the best position to determine the appropriate fair market value of these products. 
   Mr. President, the Hunger Relief Tax Incentive Act will help in our battle to feed needy Americans and I urge my colleagues to support this measure.

   Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleagues, Senators GREGG and BREAUX, to introduce two pieces of bipartisan legislation intended to encourage older Americans to remain in the workforce. Today more individuals wish to work and are capable of working beyond retirement age. Yet our laws discourage such behavior. Our policies should provide productive older Americans with incentives for staying in the workforce, paying taxes, and strengthening our economy and Social Security System. 
   The American economy, its workforce, and ensuing retirement patterns have all changed dramatically since Congress passed the Social Security Act over sixty years ago. In 1935, when the Social Security retirement age was set at age 65, most workers were employed in physically demanding jobs in either the manufacturing or agricultural sectors. The physical strain of work and the resulting health problems made it difficult for individuals to continue to labor past the age of 65. Furthermore, most individuals were not expected to live much beyond the age of retirement. The life expectancy of individuals born in 1935 was only 61 years. 
   Today's economy and workforce differs greatly from the industrial one that Social Security was designed to augment. The current American employment base is mostly service and technology driven. These sectors do not take as much of a physical toll on workers. Compared with the 1950's that witnessed 20 percent of the workforce in physically taxing jobs, today those figures are closer to 7 percent. 
   The health and life expectancy of older Americans also has improved dramatically since Social Security was enacted. In the past decade, the rate of disability among older Americans has been falling nearly three times as fast as the previous eight decades. Older Americans are living longer and healthier as a result of improvements in medicine and treatment. According to Frank Williams, a professor of medicine at the University of Rochester, the approaching trend for older Americans will be to experience a longer ``health span'' during their retirement years and a brief acute illness before death, rather than years of costly, chronic disability. Other studies have supported these findings. This suggests that older Americans have the physical abilities to continue to work beyond retirement age if they so choose. 
   Unfortunately, laws remain on the books that are designed to penalize older Americans for staying in the workforce past retirement age. We cannot afford to discourage older Americans from working. As our economy grows and the baby-boomers approach retirement, productive workers will be scarce. Tapping into the pool of experienced older Americans will be important to continue to improve our economy and standard of living. 
   The two bills I am introducing today each make four changes to our laws in an effort to encourage older Americans to remain in the workforce. The most significant disincentive for working past retirement age is the Social Security earnings test and both bills I have introduced would eliminate it. In 2000, the earnings test provides that recipients under age 65 may earn up to $10,080 a year in wages or self-employment income without having their Social Security benefits affected. Those aged 65-69 can earn up to $17,000 a year. For earnings above these amounts, recipients under age 65 lose $1 of benefits for each $2 of earnings, and those aged 65-69 lose $1 in benefits for each $3 of earnings. 
   The earnings test was established during a time when our nation pushed older employees out of the workforce in order to make room for a younger generation. Our economy is in need of all productive workers, including the growing pool of experienced older Americans. The antiquated Social Security earnings test remains an onerous work disincentive for older Americans and it should be eliminated. The elimination of the earnings test was one of the recommendations contained in the final report of the 21st Century National Commission on Retirement Policy. 
   The second provision contained in both pieces of legislation would change the Social Security benefit formula to include all earnings years in the calculation of an individual's benefit, including those that occur after retirement. Under current law, the Social Security Administration determines an individual's retirement benefit by using the average of the top 35 earnings years prior to an individual's eligibility age. For most people, retirement eligibility occurs at age 62. This means that for most Americans, those earnings that occur after age 62 are not accounted for in an individual's benefit calculation. This anomaly in the law provides a disincentive to work past retirement age. Our two bills would address this by including all earnings years in the benefit formula. Retirees will be rewarded through a higher benefit for continuing to work and pay taxes. 
   The third provision would make adjustments to the benefit formula for those who retire early and those who delay retirement. The 21st Century National Commission on Retirement Policy recommends adjustments to the early retirement benefit level and the delayed retirement credit to reflect more accurately the value of extra taxes paid if retirement is delayed. Actuarial studies have found that the Social Security benefit formula is currently weighted to favor those individuals who retire early and against those who delay retirement. These bills adjust the benefit calculation to ensure that there is not a bias in the benefit formula that discourages working. 
   Where the two bills differ is in the fourth section, which uses the tax code to induce individuals to work past the retirement age. The RARE Act I would cut individuals' portion of the FICA tax by 10 percent once they reach full retirement age as an incentive for them to stay in the workforce. Retirees would see their FICA tax cut from 7.65 percent to 6.885 percent. Under current law, the Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance (OASDI) is currently funded with a 6.2 percent tax on employee wages up to $76,200 with a matching contribution by the employer. The Hospital Insurance (HI) or Medicare portion is funded through a 1.45 percent tax on all wages with a similar employer match. Because FICA taxes are levied on the first dollar of wages earned, this tax reduction will benefit all income levels of retirees, including those who choose to work part-time after retirement. 
   The second bill, the RARE Act II, takes a bolder tax cutting approach. It would provide individuals who have reached the full retirement age with a tax credit equal to the lesser of 10 percent of the amount of income tax owed or the earned income of an individual. This provision would effectively reward older Americans who continue to earn and to pay taxes past the age of retirement. 
   Mr. President, the Retired Americans Right of Employment Acts are thoughtful pieces of legislation aimed at keeping productive workers engaged in our economy and I urge my colleagues to support these bipartisan efforts.

   Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, in the fall of 1998 our majority leader named a bipartisan group of members to a Task Force on Plutonium Disposition to advise the Senate and the Administration on actions with respect to U.S. policy and approaches to bilateral negotiations with Russia on the disposition of weapons-excess plutonium. I was pleased to be invited to join the group and Senator DOMENICI was chosen to chair the Task Force. 
   Mr. President, Senator DOMENICI has been a pioneer in the area of nuclear weapons material safety, security and elimination. He has spent a great deal of time researching this initiative and engaging our Russian colleagues on the issue. He was instrumental in creating a bilateral dialogue on plutonium disposition that led to the protocol on plutonium disposition signed in September 1998 at the Moscow Summit. This Protocol has led to ongoing negotiations to finalize a bilateral agreement to dispose of large quantities of weapons material. 
   The need for leadership in this area was clear. Unclassified sources estimate that the United States has 100 tons of plutonium and Russia has more than 160 tons of plutonium. Most of this material is in pit form, or classified weapons shape. In other words, the material could easily be returned to weapons status. The U.S. and Russia have each declared that portions of their respective stockpiles are surplus. This material represents thousands of nuclear weapons on each side, including Russian weapons that until a short time ago were pointed at American cities. 
   Mr. President, the United States has been working with Russia to dismantle their nuclear arsenal through the Nunn-Lugar Cooperative Threat Reduction program. All over Russia American firms are cooperating with Russian counterparts in deactivating nuclear warheads and dismantling long-range ballistic missiles, strategic submarines and bombers. The U.S. secured Russian agreement to remove the material from these warheads to safe and secure storage at the Fissile Material Storage Facility under construction at Mayak, Russia. But, the U.S. was still left with the challenge of how to get rid of the plutonium, to ensure that this material would never again threaten the American people.  
   Through Senator DOMENICI's discussions it became evident that a wide gulf separated the views of the Administration and Russian leadership with regard to the appropriate disposition actions. The Russians hold the position that plutonium has great value, and want to ensure that any actions extract the energy resource remaining in the material by using it as reactor fuel. The U.S. was considering both recovery of this resource and immobilization. Immobilization mixes the plutonium with ceramic material and surrounds it with vitrified, high-level waste for long term storage. Some scientists and some Russian leaders have noted that immobilization may be a less secure means of disposition than use as a reactor fuel. 
   Senator DOMENICI encouraged a solution wherein both nations would pursue the reactor fuel option, with so-called mixed oxide or MOX fuel. In addition, the U.S. can use immobilization for some of its less pure materials that would require significant purification to incorporate into reactor-grade fuel. This solution has been embraced in the current negotiations by both countries. Now both nations are moving toward parallel reductions in amounts of plutonium. 
   Our Task Force has been briefed by the Departments of State and Energy on the current status of negotiations on a Framework Agreement to implement a plutonium disposition process in Russia and the United States. A U.S.-Russian agreement to dispose up to 50 metric tons of weapons grade material on each side is proceeding in a very positive direction. I am hopeful that they will soon produce a draft agreement. There are still important issues to be resolved and hurdles to be cleared but it is clear that we would not have enjoyed this significant progress if it were not for Senator DOMENICI's leadership. His efforts in cooperation with Senator STEVENS, the Chairman of our Appropriations Committee, to secure forward funding for the implementation of this agreement was crucial in securing Russian participation. 
   I commend my good friend, the senior Senator from New Mexico, for his leadership in this area and thank him for what I hope will be a tremendously valuable national security program. We will all watch the negotiations proceeding in Moscow and hope for a positive conclusion. When this agreement is finalized and implemented, which I believe it will be, each of us will owe Senator DOMENICI a debt of gratitude for making the world safer for our children and grandchildren.

    Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, the World Conference on Religion and Peace (WCRP) is an organization that is dedicated to promoting cooperation among the religions of the world on behalf of peace while maintaining respect for religious differences. 
   Since its founding in 1970, the WCRP has become a genuinely global movement with over 30 national chapters and members in over 100 countries. 
   Two months ago, in Amman, the capital city of Jordan, the WCRP held its 7th World Assembly, which brought together senior leaders of many of the major religions of the world as well as their civil and political counterparts. 
   The Assembly was held on November 26 and 27, 1999, under the patronage of King Abdullah II and the chairmanship of Prince El Hassan bin Talal, and was attended by some 1,300 delegates from 68 countries. 
   I note that among the participants in the Amman Assembly was our distinguished former colleague, a Member from Indiana for 22 years of the House of Representatives, where he was Majority Whip, and is now President Emeritus of New York University, Dr. John Brademas. 
   Dr. Brademas, who is also Chairman of the National Endowment for Democracy (NED), presided at a discussion in Amman on ``The Shape of the Future as a Challenge to Religion.'' 
   Mr. President, the Assembly also convened a ``Forum of South Eastern European Religious Leaders'' to promote inter-religious cooperation for reconciliation, reconstruction and development in the region. Representatives from more than 25 different religious communities in 10 countries from South Eastern Europe participated in the forum. 
   I am pleased to note that the person who organized and chaired this forum, James Cairns, WCRP Project Director, South Eastern Europe, Sarajevo, lived several years in Elkhart, Indiana, where his father was a Presbyterian Church pastor. 
   As the Secretary-General of WCRP, Dr. William F. Vendley, observed, ``This unprecedented gathering of religious leaders from South Eastern Europe will initiate a process of contact and a dialogue among the religious communities both within specific states and throughout the region to develop concrete inter-religious cooperation.'' 
   Mr. President, together this group of leaders of several faiths, drawing on their diverse traditions and working together, produced a statement calling for the promotion of reconciliation, democracy and the peaceful development of South Eastern Europe, and committing themselves to opening dialogue among their communities.

    Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I take this opportunity to salute the outstanding public service of a conservationist and member of the agriculture community in the state of Indiana. 
   After 42 years of service, Bob Eddleman, Indiana State Conservationist for the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Natural Resources Conservation Service, retired at the end of December. In his role as public servant, Bob set an example for everyone with his steadfast concern for conservation and dedication to the preservation of natural resources of his home state. 
   Mr. Eddleman was born and raised on a farm in Crawford County, Indiana. He was an active member of 4-H and Future Farmers of America and took an interest in activities relating to the conservation of soil and water resources. He received a Bachelor of Science degree in Agriculture at Purdue University and a Master of Public Administration from the University of Oklahoma. 
   His career of federal service began in 1957 as a student trainee for the USDA Soil Conservation Service in English, Indiana. After serving as a soil conservationist, a district conservationist and an area conservationist in Indiana, his career path took him to New York as assistant state conservationist and then back to the Midwest as deputy state conservationist in Illinois. In 1980 Bob returned to the Hoosier state as state conservationist.  
   In his role as state conservationist with the Natural Resources Conservation Service, Mr. Eddleman has demonstrated an exceptional commitment to conserving Indiana's soil and water resources and has devoted himself to building a strong federal, state, and local partnership to provide services to Indiana citizens. He is also a leading advocate for Indiana's soil and water conservation districts. The individual accomplishments of Mr. Eddleman are many, but his years of service reflect his dedication to building working partnerships. As the result of his guidance and leadership, Indiana's Conservation Partnership is recognized as a model for other states to use to increase soil and water conservation practices on the land. 
   Mr. Eddleman served on many state-wide natural resource work groups that have directed conservation actions in Indiana including: the Indiana Lakes Management Group; the Great Lakes Watershed Management Group; the Maumee River Basin Study; the Indiana Water Committee; and the Indiana Natural Resources Land Use work group. Bob has been a 4-H leader for 27 years, has served on the Marion County Extension Board for 9 years, was recognized as a fellow of the Soil and Water Conservation Society (SWCS), and currently serves on the SWCS Board of Directors. In 1995 he received the Distinguished Agricultural Alumni Award from Purdue University in recognition of his professional achievements and dedicated service to agriculture and society. 
   Finally, Bob Eddleman served as a mentor and role model to others in federal service. There are a great number of leaders within the USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service who have gained skills in leadership and partnership building by working for and with Bob. 
   Mr. President, I regret that the State of Indiana and all conservationists will be losing Bob Eddleman. With special thanks, I salute him for his service and wish him well as he embarks upon new endeavors.

   Mr. LUGAR. The history of this situation goes back to the farm bill of 1996. At that time, the dairy provisions were the 
   final issue to be compromised. At that time, the House and the Senate agreed upon a New England dairy compact for 2 years. The 2 years were to end September 30, 1998. During that time, the USDA was charged with the need to reform the entire dairy system and reduce the number of the arrangements for pricing from roughly 38 to 13. 
   USDA acted this year. The Secretary promulgated some reforms that moved toward more of a market system. Likewise, the Secretary did not make further comment about the compacts because, under the law, they were supposed to be gone at this point. Obviously, they have not disappeared. A similar legislative predicament last year gave a wedge for the compacts to continue for another year in New England. Obviously, as the leaders have described it, that situation has occurred once again. 
   Let me say, as chairman of the Agriculture Committee, we would like to reclaim the issue. It is in our jurisdiction. It is not in the jurisdiction of the people who worked this out. They had no right to do this. They have been widely condemned for doing it. There has been no debate on the compacts in our committee or on the floor, except for the ag bill. And they should have been gone by September 30, 1998, under those provisions. Likewise, although the House did decide to disagree with the Secretary of Agriculture, the Senate did not. The Senate did not have debate on this and, the fact is, the leadership of the committee wrote to commend our Secretary of Agriculture in a bipartisan way. 
   Let me reassure the distinguished Senators from Wisconsin and Minnesota that the Agriculture Committee of the Senate will be eager to take up legislation that deals definitively with this situation. It will require a majority of the committee and a majority of this body and, likewise, some cooperation from the House. But that is the proper way to proceed. A suggestion has been made that we ought to be heard as a Senate. I suggest that that is the way we will follow. 
   We will entertain legislation with regard to these issues at the earliest possible time and ask for the support of Senators who are here on the floor involved in this colloquy to help us in that quest. 
   I thank the Chair.

   Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I will vote for this final appropriations package, because I believe that, on balance, it is a good product. However, the situation we are in today is hauntingly familiar to that of a year ago, and my disappointment in the appropriations process continues. Last minute budgeting makes sound decisions increasingly difficult. We should reform the appropriations process to safeguard the interests of taxpayers and achieve a more balanced use of our time and resources. 
   We all know that the appropriations process has grown to an inordinate length. We spend months holding hearings and negotiations, crafting sound public policy, only to scrap it in a hasty year-end scramble when we cobble together a bill negotiated by the White House budget chiefs and a few members of Congress. A 1996 CRS study revealed that budget matters eat up 73% of the Senate's time. I can't imagine we spent much less time on budget matters this year. 
   As I have been recommending since 1993, along with our distinguished Budget Committee Chairman and many other Senators, Congress should adopt a two-year budget cycle, and do the budgeting in non-election years. This would double the time available for non-budget policy issues and for carrying out often neglected oversight duties. Our goal must be to engage in lawmaking in the deliberative manner the Founders intended.

   Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I raise today in support of passage of the Conference Report to accompany S. 900, the Financial Services Modernization Act of 1999. 
   During my first term in the Senate, I served as a member of the Senate Banking Committee. It was a busy time for the Committee: we passed the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, permitted for the first time interest bearing checking accounts, and agreed to the Community Reinvestment Act. During those years, the Committee also undertook the difficult tasks of restructuring the finances for New York City and Chrysler Corporation. I am proud of the work we did on the Committee with these initiatives, and we made sure that the American taxpayers did not have to foot the bill for the restructuring of the debt. 
   I am pleased that after all these years, we are on the verge of passing comprehensive reform that has bipartisan and Administration support. This bill will finally break down inefficient barriers between insurance, banking, and securities and allow United States financial services corporations to compete on an even basis with their European and Asian counterparts. 
   Over the years, through regulation, court cases, and the development of  new financial products, the line separating banking, insurance, and securities has been blurred. In recent years, banks have been selling insurance and mutual funds; brokerage firms have been offering customers money market accounts with check writing privileges. The market was dictating that the laws needed to be rewritten. I have always believed that the laws should be written by Congress, not bureaucrats. It has taken time to fine tune these changes and reach this bipartisan consensus; but Congress has finally met this challenge. 
   Mr. President, over the course of the last five years, a lot of work and hundreds of hours have gone into perfecting this monumental legislation. I want to commend the Members of the Conference Committee, representatives from the Administration and the Federal Reserve, and the financial community for crafting a consensus piece of legislation. It will open competition, while establishing proper safeguards to protect consumer privacy and maintaining safety and soundness standards for federally insured financial institutions. 
   In a free market society, competition lowers prices and raises the level of customer service. I believe consumers will benefit from this landmark bill by giving them the choice of products and services offered by more market participants. I am pleased to have this opportunity to speak in support of the passage of this long overdue legislation. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, the Senate has begun consideration of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. I regret that the Senate is taking up the treaty in an abrupt and truncated manner that is so highly politicized. Admittedly, the CTBT is not a new subject for the Senate. Those of us who over the years have sat on the Foreign Relations, Armed Services, or Intelligence Committees are familiar with it. The Senate has held hearings and briefings on the treaty in the past. 
   But for a treaty of this complexity and importance a more sustained and focused effort is important. Senators must have a sufficient opportunity to examine the treaty in detail, ask questions of our military and the administration, consider the possible implications, and debate at length in committee and on the floor. Under the current agreement, a process that normally would take many months has been reduced to a few days. Many Senators know little about this treaty. Even for those of us on national security committees, this has been an issue floating on the periphery of our concerns. 
   Presidential leadership has been almost entirely absent on the issue. Despite having several years to make a case for ratification, the administration has declined to initiate the type of advocacy campaign that should accompany any treaty of this magnitude. 
   Nevertheless, the Senate has adopted an agreement on procedure. So long as that agreement remains in force, Senators must move forward as best they can to express their views and reach informed conclusions about the treaty. 
   In anticipation of the general debate, I will state my reasons for opposing ratification of the CTBT. 
   The goal of the CTBT is to ban all nuclear explosions worldwide: I do not believe it can succeed. I have little confidence that the verification and enforcement provisions will dissuade other nations from nuclear testing. Furthermore, I am concerned about our country's ability to maintain the integrity and safety of our own nuclear arsenal under the conditions of the treaty. 
   I am a strong advocate of effective and verifiable arms control agreements. As a former Vice-Chairman of the Senate Arms Control Observer Group and a member of the Foreign Relations Committee, I have had the privilege of managing Senate consideration of many arms control treaties and agreements. 
   I fought for Senate consent to ratification of the INF Treaty, which banned intermediate range nuclear weapons in Europe; the Conventional Forces in Europe Treaty, which created limits on the number of tanks, helicopters, and armored personnel carriers in Europe; the START I Treaty, which limited the United States and the Soviet Union to 6,500 nuclear weapons; the START II Treaty, which limited the U.S. and the former Soviet Union to 3,500 nuclear weapons; and the Chemical Weapons Convention, which outlawed poison gas. 
   These treaties, while not ensuring U.S. security, have made us safer. They have greatly reduced the amount of weaponry threatening the United States, provided extensive verification measures, and served as a powerful statement of the intent of the United States to curtail the spread of weapons of mass destruction. 
   I understand the impulse of the proponents of the CTBT to express U.S. leadership in another area of arms control. Inevitably, arms control treaties are accompanied by idealistic principles that envision a future in which international norms prevail over the threat of conflict between nations. However, while affirming our desire for international peace and stability, the U.S. Senate is charged with the constitutional responsibility of making hard judgments about the likely outcomes of treaties. This requires that we examine the treaties in close detail and calculate the consequences of ratification for the present and the future. Viewed in this context, I cannot support the treaty's ratification. 
   I do not believe that the CTBT is of the same caliber as the arms control treaties that have come before the Senate in recent decades. Its usefulness to the goal of non-proliferation is highly questionable. Its likely ineffectuality will risk undermining support and confidence in the concept of multi-lateral arms control. Even as a symbolic statement of our desire for a safer world, it is problematic because it would exacerbate risks and uncertainties related to the safety of our nuclear stockpile. 
   The United States must maintain a reliable nuclear deterrent for the foreseeable future. Although the cold war is over, significant threats to our country still exist. At present our nuclear capability provides a deterrent that is crucial to the safety of the American people and is relied upon as a safety umbrella by most countries around the world. One of the most critical issues under the CTBT would be that of ensuring the safety and reliability of our nuclear weapons stockpile without testing. The safe maintenance and storage of these weapons is a crucial concern. We cannot allow them to fall  into disrepair or permit their safety to be called into question. 
   The Administration has proposed an ambitious program that would verify the safety and reliability of our weapons through computer modeling and simulations. Unfortunately, the jury is still out on the Stockpile Stewardship Program. The last nine years have seen improvements, but the bottom line is that the Senate is being asked to trust the security of our country to a program that is unproven and unlikely to be fully operational until perhaps 2010. I believe a National Journal article, by James Kitfield, summed it up best by quoting a nuclear scientist who likens the challenge of maintaining the viability of our stockpile without testing to ``walking an obstacle course in the dark when your last glimpse of light was a flash of lightning back in 1992.'' 
   The most likely problems facing our stockpile are a result of aging. This is a threat because nuclear materials and components degrade in unpredictable ways, in some cases causing weapons to fail. This is compounded by the fact that the U.S. currently has the oldest inventory in the history of our nuclear weapons programs. 
   Over the last forty years, a large percentage of the weapon designs in our stockpile have required post-deployment tests to resolve problems. Without these tests, not only would the problems have remained undetected, but they also would have gone unrepaired. 
   The Congressional Research Service reported last year that: ``A problem with one warhead type can affect hundreds of thousands of individually deployed warheads; with only 9 types of warheads expected to be in the stockpile in 2000, compared to 30 in 1985, a single problem could affect a large fraction of the U.S. nuclear force.'' If we are to put our faith in a program other than testing to ensure the safety and reliability of our nuclear deterrent and thus our security, we must have complete faith in its efficacy. The Stockpile Stewardship Program falls well short of that standard. 
   The United States has chosen to re-manufacture our aging stockpile rather than creating and building new weapon designs. This could be a potential problem because many of the components and procedures used in original weapon designs no longer exist. New production procedures need to be developed and substituted for the originals, but we must ensure that the remanufactured weapons will work as designed. 
   I am concerned further by the fact that some of the weapons in our arsenal are not as safe as we could make them. Of the nine weapon designs currently in our arsenal, only one employs all of the most modern safety and security measures. Our nuclear weapons laboratories are unable to provide the American people with these protections because of the inability of the Stockpile Stewardship Program to completely mimic testing. 
   At present, I am not convinced the Stockpile Stewardship Program will permit our experts to maintain a credible deterrent in the absence of testing. Without a complete, effective, and proven Stockpile Stewardship program, the CTBT could erode our ability to discover and fix problems with the nuclear stockpile and to make safety improvements. 
   In fact, the most important debate on this issue may be an honest discussion of whether we should commence limited testing and continue such a program with consistency and certainty. 
   President Reagan's words ``trust but verify'' remain an important measuring stick of whether a treaty serves the national security interests of the United States. The U.S. must be confident of its ability to detect cheating among member states. While the exact thresholds are classified, it is commonly understood that the United States cannot detect nuclear explosions below a few kilotons of yield. The Treaty's verification regime, which includes an international monitoring system and on-site inspections, was designed to fill the gaps in our national technical means. Unfortunately, the CTBT's verification regime will not be up to that task even if it is ever fully deployed. 
   Advances in mining technologies have enabled nations to smother nuclear tests, allowing them to conduct tests with little chance of being detected. Similarly, countries can utilize existing geologic formations to decouple their nuclear tests, thereby dramatically reducing the seismic signal produced and rendering the test undetectable. A recent Washington Post article points out that part of the problem of detecting suspected Russian tests at Novaya Zemlya is that the incidents take place in a large granite cave that has proven effective in muffling tests. 
   The verification regime is further bedeviled by the lack of a common definition of a nuclear test. Russia believes hydro-nuclear activities and sub-critical experiments are permitted under the treaty. The U.S. believes sub-critical experiments are permitted but hydro-nuclear tests are not. Other states believe both are illegal. A common understanding or definition of what is and what is not permitted under the treaty has not been established. 
   Proponents point out that if the U.S. needs additional evidence to detect violations, on-site inspections can be requested. Unfortunately, the CTBT will utilize a red-light inspection process. Requests for on-site inspections must be approved by at least 30 affirmative votes of members of the Treaty's 51-member Executive Council. In other words, if the United States accused another country of carrying out a nuclear test, we could only get an inspection if 29 other nations concurred with our request. In addition, each country can declare a 50 square kilometer area of its territory as off limits to any inspections that are approved. 
   The CTBT stands in stark contrast to the Chemical Weapons Convention in the area of verifiability. Whereas the CTBT requires an affirmative vote of the Executive Council for an inspection to be approved, the CWC requires an affirmative vote to stop an inspection from proceeding. Furthermore, the CWC did not exclude large tracts of land from the inspection regime, as does the CTBT. 
   The CTBT's verification regime seems to be the embodiment of everything the United States has been fighting against in the UNSCOM inspection process in Iraq. We have rejected Iraq's position of choosing and approving the national origin of inspectors. In addition, the 50 square kilomater inspection-free zones could become analogous to the controversy over the inspections of Iraqi presidential palaces. The UNSCOM experience is one that is best not repeated under a CTBT. 
   Let me turn to some enforcement concerns. Even if the United States were successful in utilizing the laborious verification regime and non-compliance was detected, the Treaty is almost powerless to respond. This treaty simply has no teeth. Arms control advocates need to reflect on the possible damage to the concept of arms control if we embrace a treaty that comes to be perceived as ineffectual. Arms control based only on a symbolic purpose can breed cynicism in the process and undercut for more substantive and proven arms control measures. 
   The CTBT's answer to illegal testing is the possible implementation of sanctions. It is clear that this will not prove particularly compelling in the decision-making processes of foreign states intent on building nuclear weapons. For those countries seeking nuclear weapons, the perceived benefits in international stature and deterrence generally far outweigh the concern about sanctions that could be brought to bear by the international community. 
   Further, recent experience has demonstrated that enforcing effective multilateral sanctions against a country is extraordinarily difficult. Currently, the United States is struggling to maintain multilateral sanctions on Iraq, a country that openly seeks weapons of mass destruction and blatantly invaded and looted a neighboring nation, among other transgressions. If it is difficult to maintain the international will behind sanctions on an outlaw nation, how would we enforce sanctions against more responsible nations of greater commercial importance like India and Pakistan? 
   In particularly grave cases, the CTBT Executive Council can bring the issue to the attention of the United Nations. Unfortunately, this too would most likely prove ineffective, given that permanent members of the Security Council could veto any efforts to punish  CTBT violators. Chances of a better result in the General Assembly are remote at best. 
   I believe the enforcement mechanisms of the CTBT provide little reason for countries to forego nuclear testing. Some of my friends respond to this charge by pointing out that even if the enforcement provisions of the treaty are ineffective, the treaty will impose new international norms for behavior. In this case, we have observed that ``norms'' have not been persuasive for North Korea, Iraq, Iran, India, and Pakistan, the very countries whose actions we seek to influence through a CTBT. 
   If a country breaks the international norm embodied in the CTBT, that country has already broken the norm associated with the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT). Countries other than the recognized nuclear powers who attempt to test a weapon must first manufacture or obtain a weapon, which would constitute a violation of the NPT. I fail to see how an additional norm will deter a motivated nation from developing nuclear weapons after violating the longstanding norm of the NPT. 
   On Tuesday the Senate is scheduled to vote on the ratification of the CTBT. If this vote takes place, I believe the treaty should be defeated. The Administration has failed to make a case on why this treaty is in our national security interests. 
   The Senate is being asked to rely on an unfinished and unproven Stockpile Stewardship Program. This program might meet our needs in the future, but as yet, it is not close to doing so. The treaty is flawed with an ineffective verification regime and a practically nonexistent enforcement process. 
   For these reasons, I will vote against ratification of the CTBT.

   Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation to help our nation's farmers cope with the risks inherent in production agriculture. 
   My colleagues are familiar with the challenges facing American farmers. Prices are down world-wide. Exports are lower than expected, in large part due to the economic problems in Asia. Weather problems, from droughts to floods, have plagued large portions of our country. 
   The Senate has passed, and a conference committee is considering, an agricultural appropriations bill that contains emergency provisions to deal with these immediate needs. For the intermediate and long term, the Congressional budget resolution contains $6 billion for use in fiscal years 2001-2004 that can be used as direct payments or to help farmers manage risk. Given these available funds, the question for policymakers is how best to help farmers manage the risks that they face. 
   Some suggest that the entire $6 billion should be used to alter the subsidy structure of the federal crop insurance program. I believe that risk management is broader than crop insurance alone. To keep U.S. agriculture competitive, farmers will have to consider a variety of practices including: engaging in sophisticated marketing practices; reducing debt; considering alternative crops; and purchasing crop insurance. An approach to risk management that focuses on the crop insurance program's subsidy structure is too narrow to address the many risks faced by farmers. 
   In crafting my own risk management bill, I was guided by four principles. First, the greatest possible amount of the $6 billion should go directly to farmers. In the crop insurance program, private insurers receive substantial compensation for selling and servicing multi-peril policies on the government's behalf. Overall, the insurance companies receive about one-third of the federal financial support of the program. Farmers get the remaining two-thirds. In my view, farmers should receive more of the new federal spending. 
   Second, the $6 billion should be provided in such a manner so that it does not distort planting decisions. Leading economists believe that crop insurance encourages the planting of crops on marginal and environmentally challenged acreage. Federal risk management spending should not inadvertently subsidize overproduction when world-wide agricultural stocks are already large. Subsidizing overproduction postpones the day when agricultural prices will rebound. 
   Third, the $6 billion should be distributed equitably among farmers and among regions. In terms of eligible 1998 acres insured, farmers' participation by state ranges from a low of 4 percent to a high of 93 percent. Clearly, farmers in some parts of the country do not view crop insurance as a useful risk management tool. By spending the bulk of the increased federal assistance on crop insurance, we are denying farmers in  some parts of the country risk management help. 
   Fourth, farmers should be encouraged to pursue a variety of risk management strategies, including, but not limited to, crop insurance. Within broad parameters, farmers should be able to choose the risk management strategy that best meets their needs. 
   Mr. President, the bill I am introducing today complies with my four principles. First, of the $6 billion in available new spending, over $5 billion is sent directly to farmers. Second, because the money is sent directly to farmers and is based on historical production, it is far less likely to distort planting decisions. Third, because it is not limited only to one form of risk management--crop insurance, it is more equitable among regions. Fourth, in order to better meet farmers' individual needs, it lets farmers choose risk management strategies from a menu of options. 
   The bill directs the Secretary of Agriculture, for the 2001-2004 crops, to offer to enter into a contract with a producer in which the producer receives a risk management payment if the producer performs at least 2 of the following risk management practices each applicable year: 
   1. Purchase Federal or private crop insurance (e.g., private crop hail) that is equivalent to at least catastrophic risk protection, for at least one principal agricultural commodity produced on the farm for which federal crop insurance is available. 
   2. Hedge price, revenue, or production risk by entering into at least one standard exchange-traded contract for a future or option on a principal agricultural commodity (crops or livestock) produced on the farm. 
   3. Hedge price, revenue, or production risk on at least 10% of the value of a principal agricultural commodity produced on the farm by purchasing an agricultural trade option. 
   4. Cover at least 20% of the value of a principal agricultural commodity (crops or livestock) produced on the farm with a cash forward or other type of marketing contract. 
   5. Attend an agricultural marketing or risk management class. This includes, but is not limited to, a seminar or class conducted by a broker licensed by a futures exchange. 
   6. Deposit at least 25% of the risk management payment into a FARRM account, or a similar tax deductible account. 
   7. Reduce farm financial risk by reducing debt in an amount that reduces leverage, or by increasing liquidity. 
   8. Reduce farm business risk by diversifying the farm's production by producing at least one new commodity on the farm, or by significantly increasing the diversity of enterprises on the farm. 
   A producer's annual risk management payment will be based on his or her Federal Crop Insurance Corporation (FCIC) average actual production history (APH) established for the 2000 
   crop for each Federally insurable agricultural commodity grown by the producer. Under existing FCIC procedures, the average APH for a commodity for crop year 2000 is based on a producer's documented production and acreage history from at least 4 of the 10 immediately preceding crop years. 
   Let me give a hypothetical example of how this would work at the farm level. Suppose a farmer produces corn, soybeans, and apples for the fresh apple market on a total of 525 acres somewhere, let's say, in the eastern half of the country. Corn and soybeans are federally insurable throughout the country and apples are federally insurable in most areas that have significant apple production. Let's further suppose that this hypothetical producer has never purchased federal crop insurance before. 
   Under my bill, this grain and apple farmer would be eligible for risk management payments for each of the 2001 through 2004 crops based on his average actual production history for corn, soybeans, and apples for the four crop years covering 1996, 1997, 1998, and 1999. He could document more than four years of production history, but FCIC procedures require a minimum of four consecutive years. Let's suppose the producer's average production is 30,000 bushels of corn based on 250 acres; 10,000 bushels of soybeans based on 250 acres; and 11,548 bushels of apples based on 25 acres. The producer's average APH would be valued at the 1997-1999 average FCIC established price level for each crop. This price is $2.38 per bushel for corn and $5.80 per bushel for soybeans. The apple price varies by region. For this example, I will use a fresh apple price of $4.17 per bushel (42 pounds/bushel) which would be the applicable price for fresh apples in one of the eastern region's major apple-producing states. At these prices, the value of the producer's average APH across all crops (rounded to the nearest dollar) would be $177,554. 
   The amount of the producer's annual risk management payment would be based on a percentage payment rate determined by the Secretary of Agriculture based on $1.275 billion for each of the 2001 through 2004 crops for a cumulative total of $5.1 billion. Preliminary estimates suggest that the payment rate will be somewhere between 1 percent and 2 percent of production value if 100 percent of the eligible farmers sign up for risk management payments. Thus, a reasonable estimate is that the percentage payment rate will come out at 1.5 percent of production value. If this estimate turns out to be correct, our hypothetical grain and apple farmer's annual risk management payment (rounded to the nearest dollar) would be $2,663. The 2001 payment would be available to the farmer on or after October 1, 2000, approximately one year from today. 
   In order to qualify for his risk management payment each year, the farmer would have to certify with the Agriculture Department that he had obtained or used 2 of the 8 risk management practices each year. He could do this in a large number of ways. For example, he could qualify by purchasing crop multi-peril crop insurance on his 2001 corn or soybean production and cash forward contract at least 20 percent of the 2001 corn or soybean crop. Alternatively, he could qualify by entering into a marketing contract with a buyer for at least 20 percent of his 2001 apple production and purchase exchange-traded options to hedge price risk on his 2001 corn or soybean crop.

    Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, Friday, September 17th was National POW/MIA Recognition Day. On this day, we remember, give tribute to, and stand in solidarity with the loved ones and families of the thousands of Soldiers, Sailors, Marines and Airmen who became Prisoners of War and Missing in Action. 
   These Americans swore an oath to support and defend the Constitution and carried that promise through to great sacrifice for their nation. While thousands died, many others endured years in starved, tortured, isolated misery before regaining their freedom. Their perseverance, integrity and heroism are shining examples of the core values on which this nation was founded and became great. 
   As a former Navy officer, I feel strongly that the United States Government must fulfill its commitments to the men and women who serve in the Armed Forces. One of these commitments is ensuring the return of POWs and MIAs at the end of hostilities. The vigorous pursuit of this commitment must continue through on-site investigations being undertaken in Indochina and through a fuller examination of records in the United States, Russia, and Southeast Asia. 
   Through much diligence and hard work, and gradually improving relations with various nations since 1973, 529 American servicemen, formerly listed as unaccounted-for, have been recovered, identified and returned to their families. However, 2054 Americans remain unaccounted-for from the war in Southeast Asia, with 1,530 in Vietnam. We have focused, and rightly so, many of our efforts on Southeast Asia, but we must also honor those who were held prisoner and who are missing in action in other remote parts of the globe. More than 80,000 Americans remain missing and unaccounted for from World War I, World War II and the Korean conflict, and countless others from the Cold War. 
   Since the end of the Cold War, I have visited Russia and other states of the former Soviet Union on several occasions. During meetings with high level Russian government personnel and members of the Russian military. I have made it clear that Russian cooperation in these areas is a necessity. 
   I am hopeful that American efforts will lead to information and/or evidence of the fates of U.S. servicemen still missing from conflicts during the Cold War. I likewise encourage my colleagues who interact with officials of Laos, Cambodia, Korea, Vietnam and others to press for the same commitment from those officials. 
   Headway is being made, but there is still a long way to go before we have the fullest possible accounting of all POW/MIA personnel. Our great and free Nation owes eternal gratitude to all POW/MIAs and their families for their supreme sacrifice, but we in the Senate shall not rest until all are accounted for. I urge you the administration, the Departments of Defense and State, the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the National Security Agency to redouble our efforts.

   Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Access to Children's Health Insurance Program Act. Joining me in this effort is my colleague from Indiana in the other body, Representative JULIA CARSON.  
   Congress created the S-CHIP program in the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 as a new federal-state partnership to expand health insurance coverage for low-income children not eligible for Medicaid. Under S-CHIP states may cover children in families up to 200 percent of the federal poverty level or, in states with Medicaid income levels for children already at or above 200 percent of poverty, within 50 percent over the state's current Medicaid income eligibility limit. Congress provided over $4 billion annually to match state expenditures for this program. 
   Implementation of the S-CHIP program has been slow. States have faced both normal start-up problems as well as other obstacles to identifying and enrolling eligible children. There are an estimated 11 million children who are uninsured with 7.5 million who could be eligible for the S-CHIP program. Congress envisioned that 5 million children would receive services under S-CHIP. As of July 1999, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation, only 1.3 million children were enrolled on S-CHIP, less than half the projected enrollment in 1999. 
   The federal child nutrition programs of school lunch, child care feeding and WIC are important sources of information on potentially eligible children as well as a contact point with their parents. Typically these programs collect income information that can be used to identify eligible children, and even enroll children into federal health insurance programs. However there are limits on the disclosure of school lunch data. While state and local health programs and other means-tested nutrition programs may receive this data, Medicaid and S-CHIP may not. 
   Our bill will expand disclosure, subject to privacy provisions, to the state health agency running Medicaid and S-CHIP. As an added protection, both the State and local education authority must agree to this new disclosure. 
   The bill will also expand on a demonstration basis the use of WIC administrative funds. With the new authority, WIC clinics will be able to take a more active role in the identification and enrollment of children onto the S-CHIP and Medicaid programs. However, since funding for WIC is discretionary and funds for required program activities are tight, the number of sites will be limited. The General Accounting Office will be required to determine the added cost of the program. 
   Finally the bill will fund demonstration grants to states. The demonstration projects will integrate nutrition program grantees (schools, child care centers and WIC clinics) and other social service programs with the federal health care programs for low income children. States will form comprehensive informational and enrollment projects to be eligible for the funding. 
   Mr. President, this bill removes bureaucratic barriers so that more poor children may receive the health care they need. It does this by allowing one government entity to share information it possesses with another government entity responsible for health care. I urge my colleagues to support this bill.

   Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I want to discuss the two amendments which have been offered by my colleagues, the distinguished ranking member, Senator HARKIN of Iowa, and the distinguished chairman of the Agriculture Subcommittee on Appropriations, Senator COCHRAN. But I want to do so in the context in which Senators may be thoughtful about what type of action is appropriate, given not only the problems of agriculture but likewise the general problems that we have in this country that we are trying to address. 
   I note, for example, that the President of the United States, in his speech to the Nation on agriculture on Saturday, indicated that there are a number of things at stake here. I quote the President:  
   I am committed to working with Congress to provide the resources to help our farmers and ranchers by dealing with today's crisis and by fixing the farm bill for the future. But we must do so in a way that maintains the fiscal discipline that has created our prosperity that now makes it possible for us to save Social Security, strengthen and modernize Medicare with a prescription drug benefit and to pay off our national debt guaranteeing our long-term financial prosperity. These things are good for America's farming and ranching families, too, and they're good for all Americans.  
   I quote the President because the administration has been asked a number of times for an opinion on what type of emergency spending, if any, is appropriate at this point, on August 2, for a harvest that, by and large, is not yet in and with conditions that must, of necessity, be unknown. The administration has been reticent to address this situation with any figure, in large part because the administration and, for that matter, many 
   people in this Senate have been arguing over how the surplus we believe will come after September 30 should be spent or the surplus for future years. There have been a number of strong contending ideas which include the rescue of Medicare and Social Security reform, tax reduction, prescription drugs for those in Medicare who do not have that, and the various other things the President has cited. 
   I make this point because usually on this floor we are into that kind of debate about our future and about how to use our resources. But from time to time, we have a debate on agriculture, and everything else is suspended. It is as if the money we are talking about today, the $10.8 billion, for example, that Senator HARKIN addressed, does not pertain to any of the above--tax reduction, Medicare, Social Security, the surplus, and what have you. It is deemed emergency spending, outside the budget, outside the budget caps, outside of our general consideration. 
   If we are to do emergency spending of that amount or any amount, there must be some requirements to show the criteria for what is required. That is what I want to review with the Senate this evening. 
   I suggest the Department of Agriculture, in its most recent summary of where agriculture stands, points out that with low commodity prices in 1999, the year we are in, net farm income will be $43.8 billion. They point out that will fall below the revised estimate of $44.1 billion for 1998, last year. That means the estimate for this year is $300 million, or less than a 1 percent change, from the net income in 1998. 
   I make that point because, as I have listened to the debate, Senators appear to be describing a loss that is substantially greater than that, but USDA in estimates made just last week, plugging in the low prices and plugging in also sometimes low inputs--that is, for feed costs and various other things agriculture people will need--have come to a conclusion the net change is only the difference between $44.1 billion and $43.8 billion. 
   Beyond that, the average net income of the last 5 years has been $46.7 billion, which means this year's figure, if it comes out this way, is $2.9 billion less than the 5-year average. The average for the 8-year period covering 1990 through 1997 is $45.7 billion, so this year's result is 1.9 less than the 8-year average, or approximately 4 percent. 
   I am not making a claim it is higher; I am saying it is going to be lower. It is going to be lower by $300 million as  opposed to last year and at least $2 billion to $3 billion less than the 5-year and 8-year averages. 
   As I have been listening to the debate and Senators have described this as a depression, a circumstance, Senators must take a look at the parameters of what is the actual set of facts. Let me point out historically the high water mark for agricultural income in the last 10 years was $54.9 billion in 1996. That followed the low year in 1995 of $37.2 billion. Low of 37, high of 54.9. Average: 45, 46 for the 5-year/10-year situations. This year: 43.8, close to 44 billion. 
   That is the range. This is net income, not net loss. Agriculture had a substantial net income never below $37 billion and never higher than $54.9 billion in this 10-year period of time. 
   We are taking a look at a situation that shows loss, but we ought to quantify that loss. These are the official USDA projections as of last week. 
   Senators will recall that 1998's net farm income of $44 billion included $12.2 billion of direct Federal Government payments. About $9 billion was provided by the farm bill and the remaining $3 billion was made available by the October 1998 emergency appropriations bill. But this year, already, before this legislation comes to the floor, Federal payments are projected to be $16.6 billion. 
   Let me point out how this can be true. The safety net provided by the current farm bill--that safety net--provides for an annual transition payment, a so-called AMTA payment, of $5.1 billion. That is provided for by the farm bill, and to be paid to all farmers according to formula at the times that are prescribed. But loan deficiency payments for corn, wheat, soybean, and other crops eligible for marketing loans are estimated at $6.6 billion. This is a safety net provided by the current farm bill. 
   It has been suggested a number of times that the current farm bill, in its emphasis upon market economics, has no safety net. But I am pointing out $5.1 billion in AMTA payments and another $6.6 billion in so-called loan deficiency payments, still another $4.8 billion to be paid out in conservation and crop loss disaster payments, with $2 billion of that authorized by the 1998 October emergency appropriations bill. 
   It is important to note that most of the farm debate has focused on low prices, and charts have been given to the Senate indicating how prices have tended downward over the years. But, nevertheless, the more important figure would be price times yield; that is, the income that comes from an acre. 
   If, in fact, the price is low but the yield is high, the product of the two may still be a reasonable return for that acre in that year. There is an even more important fact that I suspect that many Senators have not thought through clearly. An article that I saw on the front page of USA Today talked about a farm meeting the distinguished occupant of the Chair attended in Illinois. That particular article mentioned low prices and pointed out the depression and the fall of those prices. 
   But if the price of corn--as has been sometimes suggested--has been quoted at elevators at $1.75 or $1.70 per bushel, the good news is that a farmer will receive, at least if he is a farmer in the central part of Indiana, $1.95. That is price guaranteed through the loan deficiency payment in that part of the state. 
   How does this work? Let's say the farmer brings the corn in and the market price is $1.70 per bushel at the time of harvest. At the Beach Grove elevator in Indianapolis, that farmer will receive what amounts to 25 cents a bushel more, bringing that $1.70 up to $1.95. The same is true for soybeans at Beach Grove, IN. The soybean loan rate will be $5.40. In some parts of the country it may be $5.26, I am advised, but it is not $4 or $4.50 or $4.60 or $3.75 or various figures that have been quoted. 
   This is a tough concept to try to get across because even after you make the point again and again, people talk about a $3.75 market price for soybeans. What I am saying is that every bushel of soybeans the farmer brings into the elevator, he is going to get $5.26 to $5.40 because the government's loan deficiency payment will provide him with a payment equal to the difference between his market price and the local county loan rate. That is very different. 
   This is not a question about how low the prices are going to go. If they go lower, the loan deficiency payment is higher. That is why the Federal Government will be paying out at least $6.6 billion to make up the difference. It was the same for wheat. In many parts of the country, the wheat harvest has already come in. But the government guarantees at least $2.58 for wheat at many elevators around the country. 
   I make that point because that is the safety net of the current farm bill. It is a pretty strong safety net. It will provide a very substantial amount of income as the harvests occur, as the grain comes in, as the loan rates are established. It will amount to $6.6 billion that has not yet been received but will be received by farmers. Hopefully, that will take the debate away from a comparison of how low the prices are going to go to the concrete figure of what the loan deficiency payment will be--specifically, as I say, again, in most parts of the country, at least $1.89 for every bushel of corn, $2.58 for every bushel of wheat, and $5.26 for every bushel of soybeans. At many elevators it will be a higher figure than that, including the one in Indianapolis that I cited. Farmers receive that even if the quoted market price is much lower. 
   Let me mention some other statistics the USDA has pointed out that may give you some idea about the parameters of our discussion. 
   In the same report last week of USDA giving estimates on net income, USDA also went into the question of farm assets and farm debt and farm equity. If you had heard the entirety of the debate today--or maybe for some time--on this issue, the Chair might logically believe that land values in this country are going down if they pertain to agriculture; that the net worth of farmers collectively in this country is going way down. That, in fact, is not the case. 
   The Agriculture Department points out that farm equity, which was $825 billion in 1996, rose to $857 billion in 1997. It is estimated to go up to $865 billion this year. That is an increase of approximately $9 billion more, or a 1-percent increase in net worth. The farm real estate figures are $802 billion for this year as opposed to $794 billion last year, and $783 billion the year before, and $746 billion the year before that. 
   It does not mean every acre of land in every county all over America is going up. As a matter of fact, the Federal Reserve Board statistics for my home State of Indiana indicate an estimate that in the first quarter of 1999, real estate values in agriculture may have gone down by 2 percent. As a matter of fact, that was true of a number of States. But in a fair number of States, obviously, the estimate is that agricultural land is going up. The aggregate, the total, for America is the land values are higher. Furthermore, the net worth is higher because farm debt will decrease from $172 billion to $171 billion. 
   Once again, listening to the debate you would say, how can that be? If we are in a depression circumstance, how can you be arguing that real estate on farms is going up, that net worth is going up, that debt is coming down? Because that is what is occurring. You can give any number of statistics about prices falling, but the fact is that net income is going to fall by $300 million. And that will still be within $2 to $3 billion of a range for the last 5 or 10 years of time. 
   Let me try to bring clarity to the argument in still another way. 
   The distinguished Senator from Iowa, Mr. HARKIN, has mentioned, in a fact sheet that he released and he gave some of these figures again today, that there will be a 29-percent drop in agricultural income, but Senator HARKIN correctly says this is a drop in principal field crops, not all of agriculture, but principal field crops. 
   I have noted that situation on my own farm. The distinguished Senator from Iowa, Mr. GRASSLEY, is on the floor. He has a family farm and could cite statistics from his farm if he were inclined to do so. 
   On my farm, Lugar farm in Marion County, IN, our net income in 1998 was 18 percent less than in 1997. That was true principally because our major income sources were soybeans and corn. My guess is that our net income in 1999 may have a similar reduction, although I hope not so great as the 18-percent that was suffered the earlier year.  
   Obviously, it makes a very great deal of difference, when you come to the net income situation or the difficulty of a farmer, whether the farmer has debt. Our situation is one in which we do not have debt. We are able to finance our operating loans, our operating expenses, without loans and out of retained capital. So that gives you a big headstart. For those farmers who have extended themselves to buy the adjacent farm or have never quite paid off the family mortgage and who must borrow each year to put a crop in the field, the interest costs are very substantial. Those are reflected still in the overall aggregate statistics of net farm income in this country. 
   As you take a look at ag statistics, the fourth that do the best as opposed to the fourth that do not do as well, very frequently the same amount of land is involved, same weather was involved. The question of debt intrudes and makes a big difference in the bottom line figure; likewise, the sophistication of the marketing plan. Even in the midst of the crisis we were talking about last week, I was able to make a sale of 1,000 bushels of corn to an elevator in Indianapolis at a figure higher than the loan rate, the government's guaranteed minimum price. That prospect was available to each farmer in America, I suspect, that day. We sold that corn for $1.97 for fall delivery. That is not a high price, but that is corn that will not be receiving a loan deficiency payment, corn sold in a market which is still out there. In weather-driven spurts, farmers have been able to market corn and soybeans even under these dire circumstances. 
   I make that point because those who made sales forward contracts last February and March were able to sell their corn and their soybeans at prices that were substantially higher. Many farmers do these sales; some farmers do not. We are attempting to deal with a situation of a total aggregate, those that did very well and those that did not do so well. 
   Finally, it seems to me it comes to a basic decision the Senate must make. That is, should the Senate say that agriculture, farmers in America, ought to be made whole, at least to the extent their income is raised to, say, the average level of the last 5 years or the average level of the last 10 years? Is it the goal of the Senate to say no, that is not good enough? What we ought to do is make certain that 1999 is one of the best years agriculture has ever had. 
   The proposals before us today will not boost the $44 billion more or less of net farm income to $54.9, although they come very close. If the Democratic amendment was adopted and, literally, you added $10.8 billion to the estimate of 43.8, you come up to 54.6, which is just 300 million short of the all-time record for net farm income. In short, not a rescue operation but an idea, I suspect, that this is a good time to, if not set a new record, at least come very close to that through additional Government payments. That may not be the intent of the Senate. 
   My guess is most Senators understand that farm income is down 
   and they would like to make farmers whole, at somewhere around an average level, which would appear to mean a payment of $2 or $3 billion. Neither of the proposals before us is of that nature. 
   I have pointed out in colloquies with the press during the past week that there is before the Agriculture Committee now a risk management bill that would, in fact, provide about $2 billion a year for each of the next 3 years if passed, and that would pretty well fill the gap, if that was the intent of the Senate to do that. 
   I conclude that Senators finally will take a look at this entire situation and reach some overall judgments. Let me offer at least some reasons why some payments might be justified. 
   First of all, farmers or the rest of America could not have anticipated the Asian crisis that hit about 2 years ago. The last year, in 1998, probably took away 40 percent of the demand of Asian countries for American agricultural products. That probably took away 10 percent of our entire market last year, which means that demand fell overnight by 10 percent, whereas supplies for the last 3 years have not only been ample but around the world the weather has been mighty good and the amount of supply abundant, really throughout that period of time. So a 40-percent hit in terms of the Asian export demand hit very hard. It hit suddenly. Within a 90-day period of time we realized that difficulty. 
   Let me also mention, in addition to the Asian situation and the oversupply situation, the abnormally good weather in China, in Europe, in Brazil, in Argentina, Australia, major sources of food throughout the world, that the American farmers have run up against the problem of genetically modified organisms in European debate, which means that Europeans are rejecting corn and soybeans that come with the roundup ready genetic changes. 
   As we all know in America agriculture, in order to get rid of the weeds in the field, it is a much simpler process. It strengthens, certainly, the soybean and corn plants, if a gene is changed in the corn or soybean plants that rejects the herbicides that kills all the weeds but leaves the corn and the soybeans standing. We believe that not only is corn and soybeans from such situations safe, but as a matter of fact, our yields have increased. The health of the plants has increased, and we felt all over the world people might want to benefit from these breakthroughs. Not so in Europe, and a debate rages as to whether there is something fundamentally wrong with our genetically modified seeds to the point we are finding it very difficult to export a single bushel of corn or beans to the European market. That debate is going to go on for awhile, and it has not been helpful. 
   We are on the threshold of a World Trade Organization meeting in Seattle that comes up in October. We must have fast track authority. That is, the President must be able to negotiate on behalf of the administration with other countries, knowing this body will vote up or down on the treaty without amendment, because amendments by all of us attempting to influence the situation to benefit our particular States or crops or so forth could be matched by amendments all over the world and the treaty negotiations collapse. 
   We don't have fast track authority. We have tried in this body several times to obtain that. The House of Representatives had similar difficulties. It will require enormous leadership by the President and by many of us, but we cannot make a new treaty that knocks down trade barriers, that increases our exports in the way that all Senators want, without doing the basic steps. Fast track authority is one of them, as well as a determined will that agriculture will not be left off the wagon, that agriculture is an integral part of what our Nation must do at the WTO meetings. 
   I make this point because we talk, often glibly, about the need for exports. Of course, we have a need for exports. But they will not happen in the quantities that we need to have happen without lowering tariff and nontariff barriers, and the Seattle meeting is where that does or does not get done. If we don't have fast-track authority, it will not occur during this administration. That is a long time. 
   So for all these reasons, farmers have taken a direct hit, largely because of worldwide demand and in the case of many fields in the State of Illinois, or in my State of Indiana, or the State of Iowa, as much as a third to a half of all our acreage literally results in yields that must be exported, or we have it coming up around our ears. We know that and yet, as a Nation, we have not moved aggressively to make the difference that has to occur. 
   So for all these reasons, the Senate might come to a conclusion that some compensation is required for farmers in order to keep their cash flow going. I made the point earlier that, as a matter of fact, loans will be reduced this year. But cash flow will be reduced, also. And for those farmers who have the need for operating loans, who are genuinely in danger because of debt situations, the situation could be dire and family farms could be lost. 
   In the event that we are to make payments, the so-called AMTA payments, put money into the hands of farmers quickly, directly, and certainly--we had a pretty good demonstration of that last year. The Senate, in its wisdom, at the very end of the session as the large appropriation compromise came together, appropriated as part of a package about $6 billion for American agriculture. It came as a surprise to many, but the  form of it came as a surprise that was even more difficult. About $3 billion of it came in AMTA payments. Those were made immediately. They were received by farmers in the first week of November, after passage late in October of the appropriation bill. 
   I make that point because if we are serious about money actually arriving in the hands of farmers, then we must be serious about the distribution method. The AMTA method gets the money to farmers. It does increase cash flow. It is seen as equitable. The ratios were long ago worked out on the basis of crop history and the signatures for the farm bill. The other half of the $6 billion was for so-called disaster payments. They were ill-defined then, as they are ill-defined now in the legislation in front of us. 
   The USDA struggled and, as a matter of fact, finally made payments in June of this year--not in November or October of last year--and it did so after exploring not only disasters of 1998 in some States, but '97, '96, '95 and '94--multiple years, all mopped up with some type of distribution and equity found among all sorts of contending parties in various States and counties. 
   Mr. President, money is not going to get to farmers very fast in distribution methods that suggest that type of procedure, however humane the motivation may be. As a matter of fact, payments aren't going to go to any farmer very soon from this legislation because the House of Representatives is not prepared to act upon this. So, therefore, whatever we are doing with urgency now is going to be a matter for September, or if the appropriation bills do not pass for October or November, or whenever a grand compromise occurs. 
   I make that point because farmers listening to this debate might feel there is some possibility as of tomorrow or the next day a vote by the Senate could lead to money coming to them. But it will not come to them very soon, whatever our result may be on the floor. Therefore, last week, I suggested that we have 3 days of hearings before the Senate Agriculture Committee, in which on the first day the Secretary of Agriculture would come before the committee and, hopefully, respond to our questions as to what the administration's recommendations are, given all that the President 
   and the Secretary have said about the overall budget condition, about taxes, about Medicare, about Social Security, and given the administration's view of what is appropriate farm or agricultural legislation. 
   And if you follow this with other groups in our society who would respond to Senator's questions about this, the committee will hold a markup in the first week of September so that the Appropriations Committee that must now struggle with this legislation would have a fairly clear roadmap of what the compromises were and what considerations have been given. 
   Furthermore, the September debate would give us a pretty good idea of what the yields actually are going to be for a number of our major crops. I suspect that, even as we speak, as people now begin to talk about a different problem in agriculture--namely, drought--a whole slew of new considerations are going to come into the picture. The price might go up and the yield might go down. Once again, the product of the two is the critical element, rather than the new per acre. 
   Mr. President, obviously, we are in this debate because the occupant of the chair and, more particularly, the distinguished floor leader has indicated that we need to get on with this. I accept that fact. We will have tomorrow morning in the Agriculture Committee at 9 o'clock an appearance by the Secretary of Agriculture. We will ask him for his testimony and we will ask him for the administration's point of view, which I think is relevant to what we are discussing here. 
   I know it is relevant on the basis of last year's experience because we passed an agriculture appropriation bill, and it had considerable benefits for farmers. But it was vetoed by the President. And, as a result, the benefits did not accrue very rapidly, and we got into what I would say was a bidding war again. That is not advisable if it can be avoided in some normal framework. So I am hopeful that we will have a hearing, and at least that it will provide some benefit for the debate we are now having before us, and certainly for the debate we shall have again. We will have it again because the Appropriations Committees will have to come back with conference reports, and we will have to judge the adequacy or inadequacy of what we have done at that point. 
   Mr. President, I finally make the point that the previous speakers have stated there is an emergency to be met, an immediate need for income. But, fundamentally, we must debate the entire farm bill when we come back--not simply a question of adequate income for farmers, but the fundamental law of the land. 
   I am prepared for that debate, but I simply say that before Senators get engaged in the debate, it is well to gauge at least the benefits that come from the current farm bill. There are, to date, $16.6 billion this year, which is just $100 million short of an all-time record of farm payments. That is a substantial safety net. I make the point that the farm bill recognizes that point and, in fact, provides fairly amply when that occurs. But it also provides freedom to farm, and that is very important to most farmers in this country--the ability to determine how to manage their land, how many acres of corn, or beans, or cotton, or rice, or whatever the farmer wants to plant, or not to plant at all. The AMTA payment comes to a farmer who does not plant at all, because this is a transition from the date of supply control to a day in which we move into market economics and the farm area more completely. The thing the world dictates presently is that market economics is the important way to go. Our country testifies to that in almost every other debate. 
   I hope we will continue to testify in behalf of that when it comes to American agriculture. 
   I thank the Chair for this indulgence; likewise for other Senators. 
   I am hopeful that before action is taken on either of the two amendments, there will be testimony by the Secretary and then very thorough analysis by each Senator as to what our obligations should be to American agriculture both to encourage and enhance it and, likewise, that our obligation is to all the taxpayers of the country and the other major objectives that lie before our country. 
   I thank the Chair.

   Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I wish to state the purpose of my amendment. The purpose of the amendment is to restore funding for the National Endowment for Democracy. I am pleased to be joined by Senator GRAHAM and Senator MACK, who serve with me as members of the Board of Advisors for the National Endowment for Democracy. We are proposing funding the NED at $30 million, which is $2 million below the President's request and $1 million less than this year's funding level. It is also $1 million below the authorization level that has already been approved by the Senate. 
   Our amendment proposes to shift $30 million from the Capital Investment Fund in the State Department title of the bill. I regret very much having to propose this shift because I, like the chairman of the subcommittee, believe the Capital Investment Fund is important to the effective operation of the Department of State and that the account is underfunded. But if we are successful in making the offset, I will work with the chairman and others to try to help find the moneys to help restore that funding to the Capital Investment Fund. 
   The problem the subcommittee faced was a serious problem. There is simply inadequate funding in the 150 function of the International Affairs Account. That scarcity of funds forced difficult choices about priorities and required much give and take. In my judgment, the National Endowment for Democracy must be a high priority. There is no funding for the National Endowment in the bill before us. That is why we are compelled to propose the amendment I have just introduced. 
   The reason for proposing the amendment is that the appropriations bill provided no funds--none at all--for the National Endowment. The Endowment did not even merit a mention in the bill; it is completely ignored. This zero-funding decision was made even though the Senate approved a straight-line funding level of $31 million in the State Department authorization bill, which we considered earlier this year, and even though successive administrations and successive Congresses have supported full, or near full, funding for the NED year after year. 
   It is a unique phenomenon perhaps that the NED has enjoyed strong bipartisan support since 1983 when it was created by the Reagan administration. The NED has consistently gained the support of both Republican and Democratic administrations since then and of every Republican and Democratic Congress over the past 15 years. But not in this bill. 
   The committee report accompanying the bill does recommend that funds for the NED be found among other divergent State Department accounts. This simply is not a good idea. Funding directly from the State Department would make the NED a grantee of the State Department and make it an arm of the Department. This would eliminate NED's line item, destroy its independence, and undermine its ability to gain access to grassroots organizations fighting for freedom and democracy in other countries all over this world--the very heart of NED's effectiveness. 
   For this reason, former Secretaries of State have written of the importance of retaining the independence of the NED in a 1995 letter. They wrote:  
   We consider the nongovernmental character of the NED even more relevant today than it was at NED's founding twelve years ago.  
   NED's effectiveness comes in good part because it has an independent status, functions as a nongovernmental organization, and has a board that operates as an independent board of advisers. We have faced and confronted challenges to the NED numerous times in the past. The Senate has debated funding for the NED six times since 1993. Two years ago, we faced a comparable effort to slice and dice the NED. I proposed an amendment at that time to restore funding, and it was approved by the Senate by a vote of 73-27. A few weeks ago, in another challenge to NED, this time proposing a different manner by which NED allocates its internal grant-making funds among the four core institutes; the amendment was defeated by 
   an almost identical vote of 73-26. That has been the pattern, fortunately, over the years. 
   Let me just say I am sympathetic to the extraordinary difficulty facing the managers of the bill. There are so many critical issues in the various titles of the appropriations measure, and the NED is a very small item by comparison. But this is just the point. The NED has been a very cost-effective vehicle for promoting democracy, human rights, and civic society around the world. Given its presence in some 90 countries, many on the threshold of democratic breakthroughs and others struggling with the transition to a more open society, NED's relatively small funding level is a genuine bargain. It is an exceptional investment in security for the United States of America. 
   We often speak in broad generalities about promoting democracy, expanding democratic values, and promoting human rights around the world. The point that must be made is that doing  so is very much in our national interest. These are not whimsical ideas. Securing strong democracies should be one of the most effective means of combating and deterring the spread of terrorism, coping with the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, promoting market economic practices and principles and creating opportunities to expand our markets, supporting fair labor practices, and forestalling the destabilizing effects stemming from refugee flows. 
   None of these goals comes easily, and, as a Nation, we have decided it is in our national interest to encourage and to assist those in other countries who share the same ideals as we do in the United States. The NED is a key instrument in achieving these democratic goals and values. 
   Over the past 15 years, the NED and its four core institutes have worked openly with willing counterparts in other countries to spread the ethos of democracy around the world. The four core institutes working with the NED itself are each affiliated with domestic American institutions. They are: A, the International Republican Institute, the IRI, and B, the National Democratic Institute, the NDI, which help build political parties, help to ensure free and fair elections, and strengthen governing institutions and civic society. They are loosely affiliated with the Republican and Democratic Parties. Then, C, the Center for International Private Enterprise, CIPE, which promotes the growth of private enterprise in a democratic process, is affiliated with the Chamber of Commerce, 
   and (d) the American Center for International Labor Solidarity, which has links to AFL-CIO and supports the development of independent trade unions. The Solidarity Movement in Poland was an early grantee, for example. The NED itself funds grassroots organizations that promote independent media, human rights, civic education and the rule of law in other countries. 
   Testimonials on behalf of the NED have poured in from former Presidents, former Secretaries of State and former national security advisors, from grantees and non-grantees alike. These testimonials represent a veritable Who's Who in the world movements for democracy and human rights. These names include His Holiness the Dalai Lama; Harry Wu, the Human Rights Activist; Elena Bonner, Russia civil rights advocate; Clement Nwankwo, Chairman of the Transition Monitoring Group in Nigeria; Vaclav Havel, President of the Czech Republic; Lech Walesa, leader of the Solidarity movement in Poland; and countless others from some 80 to 90 countries in every region of the world. 
   Mr. President, I had hoped to avoid a debate on this issue this year. I had hoped that some agreement or arrangement could be made so that we could move ahead without delaying this appropriation bill. That certainly has been my intent. I regret that this has not been possible. 
   The amendment is now before the Senate. 
   I simply say that in the early 1980's when clearly it was the intent of the United States to push for democracy and human rights that the means of doing that were not at all clear to President Reagan and our Secretary of State. As a matter of fact, many felt it was inappropriate that the President and the Secretary of State sought to intervene in the affairs of other countries around the world suggesting changes of government, although this is clearly what we wanted to see. 
   The changes in Eastern Europe could not have occurred without Lech Walesa, and Lech Walesa's movement which were heartily adopted by the AFL-CIO of this country. Through informal but very effective means of finance and organization, that fledgling labor movement in Poland was given not only strength but legitimacy throughout the world as a democratic movement of change, an alternative to a government which at the time seemed very solid. 
   At the same time, from my own recollection and experience, I recall the efforts of the Roman Catholic Church in Central America and in the Philippines, and of American businesses who were farsighted and who understood the interests of our country laying freedom for people and democracy in contract law and the rule of law--the same principles we debate now with regard to Russia, as we have worked with Russians. 
   How do you establish these situations, and do so without violation of diplomatic principles? Because our Nation, our President, our Secretary of State, must deal with leaders as they are constituted now and with their foreign ministers and defense ministers. 
   But a very unique organization came from these considerations. It was called the National Endowment for Democracy. 
   It included Republicans, Democrats, labor officials, Chamber of Commerce people, and a check and balance so that our own American view had four dimensions. This was not ideological, not official, but arose from the best grassroots leadership of this country. And it was effective. 
   The changes in the world we now take for granted--the celebration we had at the 50th anniversary of NATO, the accession of Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic into NATO--we take for granted that democracy there came forward. 
   The point I am making is that it did not come forward because our State Department advocated that and brought it about, although clearly they support the shift to democratic systems. There was no official governmental way of bringing about those responses, which require money, fledgling newspapers, grassroots organizations, a how you print ballots, and how you register voters. All the nitty-gritty of politics we take for granted, but which could not be taken for granted in those countries which had not enjoyed those options. 
   The issue before the Senate, very frankly, is that some Members I suspect may have become weary of the democracy business. They may think that was important then and this is now. 
   I would just suggest that at the NED board meetings which I attend regularly there are routinely 80 to 100 proposals in which the National Endowment for Democracy and its core groups debate on these principles. We take seriously the idea of democracy and human rights. We think that is still a very important subject in this world. This is not routine. It is not freely dismissed as something that was lost in the budget. It was not mentioned, but the State Department might find if it came to their attention. 
   We believe that the statement by the Senate ought to be clear--that we stand for democracy and the National Endowment for Democracy is a very good way to achieve democracy, and to do so year by year in a systematic and effective way. 
   I point out that it is important, I suppose, to have this debate each year as a wake-up call. There may come a time when we become so blase and so routine about our functions that we forget human rights. But I hope that will never be the case. 
   I suspect that those who are still struggling in parts of southeastern Europe--certainly in many Asian countries--those who are considering democracy in China, those in Latin America and Africa and those who are still trying to make it work out in various provinces of Russia welcome our help. They welcome labor leaders and business leaders from this country. They welcome Senators like JOHN MCCAIN, who heads up the Republican Institute; or ORRIN HATCH, who was there at the beginning of the National Endowment. 
   Senator CONNIE MACK of Florida, one of our board members now, and Senator BOB GRAHAM of Florida, one of our board members now, have both been so effective in Latin America and Central America, and not just in the 1980's when we were all going down for inspection of elections, trying to help people find out how to campaign, and how to count votes successfully. 
   A lot of that heavy lifting still needs to be done. 
   Although this is a debate that I wish did not occur annually, but so be it. It is a time really for Senators to stand up and be counted on whether they feel passionately, as I do, and I think many of us do, about democracy and human rights and what we can do about it effectively. 
   I am simply making the point that the State Department cannot do that by force. We as American citizens working through grassroots organizations and through informal means can  get the money and the organization to make a difference, which ultimately our President can recognize and our Secretary of State can bless. 
   I point out, parenthetically, that the incumbent Secretary of State, Madeleine Albright, has served on the Board of the National Endowment for a number of years as has Zbigniew Brzezinski, as distinguished members of the Democratic Party. We now have Paul Wolfowitz, a distinguished American diplomat and scholar, as one of the Republicans, serving on the board. 
   This has been a case of people giving of their time and their substance in private life even as they go back and forth into the public sector and serve our country in that way. 
   I finally make the point that we are indebted to excellent editorials that appear in major newspapers in the last few days. 
   I simply quote a sentence from the New York Times editorial of yesterday in which they call for a vote for democracy abroad, a leading editorial. They say:  
   It is hard to think of a dictatorship whose opponents have not benefited from the endowment.  
   That I think is an important point. 
   As you name the dictatorships of this world, they knew what hit them. In most cases it was the Endowment for Democracy and its advocates, and its supporters that made the difference. 
   There may be all sorts of theories why these governments rose and fell. But I suggest that those of us who suggest it through the ballot box initiative really had to have a horse to ride on, and the means at least of making those alternatives effective. 
   I cite, for example, the current discussion in Serbia where many persons believe--starting with our President--that President Milosevic would not be a suitable candidate for reelection or for a continuation. But the press keeps pointing out, What are the alternatives? How do habits change, if it is to occur in a democratic way? 
   Where are the fair procedures? In fact, where has the United States been in terms of actively boosting those who wanted freedom, who wanted a different kind of Serbia, who espouse those values in this country but had no effective vehicle? 
   Those are the missions that lie ahead. I hope we will be worthy of the task. I advocate the adoption of the amendment. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, it would be remarkable for any American to celebrate his or her 75th birthday by sky-diving, but it is even more remarkable when that person is the former President of the United States. I would expect no less however, of former president George Bush. 
   From the South Pacific to China to the White House, he has been as brave and bold in honorably serving his country as he has been in his private life. His leadership in holding together the international coalition during the Gulf War seems even more remarkable in recent years, as other attempts to hold together a Persian Gulf alliance have failed. 
   Mr. President, I am pleased to join the Senator from Connecticut, Mr. LIEBERMAN, in bringing attention to a wonderful story by the indefatigable White House Correspondent, Trude Feldman. Few people could provide such insight in profiling President George Bush on the occasion of his 75th birthday.

    Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I rise today to join Senator BAYH in introducing legislation to bestow a Congressional Gold Medal on Reverend Theodore M. Hesburgh, C.S.C., president emeritus of the University of Notre Dame. 
   In 1952, at the age of 35, Father Hesburgh became the fifteenth president of the University of Notre Dame. He served in that position for a remarkable 35 years. At the time of his retirement in 1987, he had the longest tenure among active American university presidents. Father Hesburgh's leadership and vision, together with the hard work of faculty, staff, alumni, and students, built Notre Dame into one of the premier universities in the United States. 
   In you ask any Golden-domer, they will tell you that Father Hesburgh's contributions to the University of Notre Dame are as big as the 13-floor library that bears his name. Notre Dame grew exponentially in research funding and in endowment during Father Hesburgh's presidency. When he assumed the office in 1952, Notre Dame served fewer than 5,000 students. Today it is an internationally recognized university of nearly 10,000 students engaged in every imaginable academic discipline. 
   More importantly, through his example and direction, Father Hesburgh inspired the university community to pursue not only academic excellence and international prominence, but also justice and spiritual meaning. Few universities have succeeded at creating an environment so committed to public service and so rich in its dialogue between the intellectual and the spiritual. 
   As Father Hesburgh worked to build the University of Notre Dame into what it is today, he simultaneously answered the call to serve his nation and the world. His career has embodied the principle of public service that he espoused at Notre Dame. 
   Father Hesburgh has held a remarkable 15 Presidential appointments over the years, covering such diverse topics as the peaceful uses of atomic energy and campus unrest. He was a charter member of the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights, created in 1957, and he chaired the commission from 1969-1972. 
   All the while he remained a national leader in education, serving on many commissions and study groups. He chaired the International Federation of Catholic Universities from 1963 to 1970. In this position and through his writings, he was instrumental in redefining the importance of international studies in higher education and the nature and mission of a contemporary Catholic university. Father Hesburgh also served four Popes as a Vatican representative to the International Atomic Energy Agency and other international assemblies. 
   The problems of underdeveloped nations have been a special interest of Father Hesburgh. He joined the board of the Overseas Development Council in 1971. His fund-raising work as Chairman helped avert mass starvation in Cambodia in 1979 and 1980. He also chaired the Select Commission on Immigration and Refugee Policy between 1979 and 1981. The recommendations of the Commission became the basis of legislation five years later. 
   Father Hesburgh's lengthy list of awards include the Medal of Freedom, bestowed by President Johnson in 1964. He is also the recipient of 135 honorary degrees, the most ever awarded to an American. 
   In retirement, Father Hesburgh has become a best-selling author. He still plays a major role in the development of higher education through the institutes he was instrumental in founding at Notre Dame, including the Kroc Institute for International Peace Studies and the Kellogg Institute for International Studies. Father Hesburgh chairs the advisory committee for both institutes. 
   Despite his innumerable accomplishments, Father Hesburgh has always remained grounded in the campus life of Notre Dame University. He continues to frequently lecture and preside at mass. He talks with everyone who approaches him and still loves having lunch with students daily to discuss their views on the courses and programs he has been so instrumental in advancing. 
   Mr. President, Father Hesburgh's life stands as an example of the type of service, dedication, and faith that the Congressional Gold Medal was meant to commemorate. I encourage my colleagues to join Senator BAYH and myself in supporting this legislation.

    Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, over the Memorial Day weekend, a series of events and memorial services were held in Indianapolis honoring our nation's Medal of Honor winners. Nearly 100 of all of the living Medal of Honor recipients came to Indiana to participate in the ceremonies as honored guests. In addition to paying tribute to these heroes and celebrating their remarkable accomplishments with a healthy dose of Hoosier hospitality, a new memorial to the Medal of Honor winners was dedicated. This memorial is only one of its kind in the nation. All of this was made possible by countless numbers of volunteers who worked tirelessly to carry out this program that was initiated and undertaken by IPALCO Enterprises of Indianapolis. 
   Following this remarkable weekend. I received a letter from Major General Robert G. Moorhead, USA (Ret.), who through his words captured the sentiments of many of my State who were a part of these historic and moving events.

   Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I rise to oppose the amendment of the distinguished Senator from Wisconsin. 
   The National Endowment for Democracy for the last 18 years has made grants to organizations all over the world to boost democracy in the most critical areas. It came about during the Reagan administration, in which the genius of the plan, of pulling together representatives of the Republican Party, the Democratic Party, the National Chamber of Commerce, and AFL-CIO, brought checks and balances within our own political spectrum but  outside the State Department, outside the Government. For the last 18 years, these grants have not been politicized. As a matter of fact, as there are areas of concern that come to the board of the National Endowment, each of the four groups is asked to meet the challenge, to offer alternatives competitively for peer review, and then review by staff, and finally votes by members. 
   I have been privileged to serve for the last 8 years on the board of the National Endowment for Democracy. At each meeting I have examined over 100 of these grants. They come, each time, with really superior effort by four entities we can count on, the two party institutes in the Chamber and the labor people of this country. 
   I see no need to amend that process. It is a process that has worked well. It is a process that has not been politicized. It has a good track record. If the Senator's amendment is adopted, we will inevitably have a fairly large bureaucracy of people sifting through grants from all sources. 
   Grants do come from some 250 different entities and formulate at least a third of the grants that are awarded by the board. Some of these are worthy and some are not so worthy, but we can count upon quality of response, and I think that is important. It is a situation of trying to fix something that is not broke, and I hope Senators will resist that impulse. There is not a compelling need for change. The amendment did not have any type of airing in a hearing for examination and for testimony by witnesses on either or all sides.

   Mr. LUGAR. I thank the Chair. 
   I rise to oppose the amendment of the distinguished Senator from Wisconsin. He clearly is a strong proponent and advocate of democracy and has stimulated discussion on these issues as a valued member of the Foreign Relations Committee. The National Endowment for Democracy which was founded in 1983 included the so-called four ``core'' groups from the Republican Party, the Democratic Party, Organized Labor, and the Chamber of Commerce. 
   That foundation was deliberate. It was not a question of a strange arrangement in which four groups in Washington sequestered the funds for their own benefit. Very clearly, President Reagan and a bipartisan majority of the Congress found that the checks and balances inherent in that debate were very important in making certain that the National Endowment for Democracy was not politicized. 
   Let me mention that to have competition in which as many as 250 groups interested in democracy compete for money, almost guarantees a substantial bureaucracy to vet all of the points of view and applications. Furthermore, under the worst of circumstances, it does not necessarily bring about a strong bipartisan scrutiny of each other's proposals, quite apart from the scrutiny that organized labor might get from the Chamber of Commerce and vice versa. In fact, the system has worked remarkably well. 
   I have served as a member of the Board of the National Endowment for Democracy during the past 8 years. I have witnessed the process in which the Board--which is not divorced from the debate in Washington--thinks through those areas of the world that need specific emphasis. 
   Each of the four core groups is charged with finding proposals and finding specific groups, often in countries that are emerging democracies, to bring forward ways in which democracy might be enhanced. Sometimes it is under very arduous and dangerous circumstances. It is only after the core groups make their proposals, having reviewed them thoroughly, that the staff of the National Endowment for Democracy scrutinize them, ask for amendments, suggest changes, delays or rejection. 
   Specific members of the Board who have particular expertise in various areas of the world spend a great deal of time pro bono taking a very careful look at those proposals. But finally, each one of us, as Board members, must pass on each and every single one of these grant applications. 
   On occasion we reject a fair number during a meeting, quite apart from whether a quota of grants has been allocated specifically to the four. Each of the four ``cores'' has the ability and the talents to bring forward remarkable proposals for the advancement of democracy. That has been occurring for the past 16 years. 
   The Foreign Relations committee has not held hearings on this proposal. It comes literally out of the blue. It may have some merit for another organization at another time, but for this organization the genius was in its initial inception--an opportunity to bring forward proposals that were not coming from the U.S. Government, from the State Department, from the White House, or the National Security Council. 
   It brought forward proposals from well-defined institutions in our society that are broadly based--members of the Democratic and Republican parties, often elected officials, responsible to their constituents, who are well aware of political currents in the country, and the institutions that characterize our national Chamber of Commerce and the AFL-CIO. 
   As a matter of fact, the Solidarity movement found resonance with the AFL-CIO. It was the labor movement of our country that 
   brought forward one of the most significant sets of proposals and advocacy. 
   It is a fact that at the recent 50th anniversary NATO celebration, one of the great honors paid in this city was by the National Endowment for Democracy to Lech Walesa. In many ways, Lech Walesa's leadership, courageous as it was at a turning point in history, was a hallmark of the work of the National Endowment. The checks and balances were at work, because other groups took a look at the labor/Solidarity situation in Poland and wondered whether it was appropriate for the United States Government to be appropriating funds that led to the change of government in that country. On balance, our Government appropriated those funds but the National Endowment did make the decisions. 
   They were outside the bureaucracy of the Federal Government, outside the politicization that occurs when one party or another gains dominance and  a particular type of preferential structure. 
   I make these points because I believe this is an arrangement that works well. If the wagon isn't broke, we should not try to fix it. The situation is clearly one that does not require any fixing. 
   There may be institutions in our society that wish we had established a different sort of endowment. I suspect that if Members are prepared to vote for this amendment, it will be a very different National Endowment for Democracy. But I caution Members about the dangers of making these changes. Therefore, I ask for careful consideration by Members. I ask, in fact, consideration of the remarkable work that is now being done by the National Endowment for Democracy and the 16 years of very solid achievement by many great Americans who were outside of our Government, but who participated in boosting democracy through this vehicle. 
   I ask, therefore, for the defeat of the Feingold amendment. I am hopeful that as the votes are counted tomorrow, the National Endowment will receive a vote of endorsement. 
   I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.

   Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, Secretary of Agriculture Glickman recently announced reforms for the Federal milk marketing order system. These reforms were authorized by the 1996 farm bill in an effort to modernize and streamline an out-dated and arcane structure for pricing the nation's milk. As was the case with other commodities, the farm bill intended that Federal dairy policy be more modern and market-oriented to reflect innovations in the milk industry and to position the United States to become a major trader in world markets. In announcing the reforms, Secretary Glickman said, ``These reforms will help make sure that America's dairy farmers receive a fair price and that American consumers continue to enjoy an abundant, affordable supply of milk. Our changes will also simplify the wholesale milk pricing system, making it more market-oriented and more equitable.'' The changes are positive  steps toward accomplishing the goals stated by the secretary. The new structure is more market-oriented, more beneficial to consumers and more equitable to farmers across the Nation. 
   During consideration of the 1996 farm bill, Congress could not agree on a policy to modernize milk marketing orders. The task of designing a consumer-friendly and market-oriented program was turned over to the Department of Agriculture. The Secretary was given until 1999 to design this new policy. In the interim between 1996 and 1999, Congress allowed the northeast region of the country to set up a dairy compact in which producers could receive a higher price for their milk. Authority for the compact was scheduled to end with the implementation of the new milk marketing order policy. 
   On January 2, 1998, as Secretary Glickman prepared to consider changes to federal dairy policy, I wrote to him suggesting several ways to make dairy policy more consumer friendly and market oriented. Included in my recommendations was an overhaul of Class I differentials which set the prices that farmers receive for fluid milk. Shortly thereafter, USDA released its proposed rule for milk marketing order reform. The proposed rule contained seven different options for pricing structures and noted Secretary Glickman's preference for the more market-oriented ``Option 1B'' for pricing Class I milk. On February 25, 1998, I again wrote to Secretary Glickman in support of his commitment to a more market-oriented approach and made recommendations for other changes that modernize federal dairy policy. 
   The contents of the final rule were highly controversial. No one interested in dairy policy--producers, processors or consumers--was satisfied. Contradictory bills to amend portions of the final rule were introduced in both chambers of Congress. If I had written the final rule, I would have made some changes also. 
   However, we should reflect on the entire rule and the process that led to its promulgation. Because of the complexity of, and controversies surrounding, dairy policy, Congress, in the 1996 farm bill, gave USDA the responsibility to draw upon its expertise, consult with the public and design a thoughtful milk marketing reform policy. USDA spent three years formulating the reforms contained in the final rule. During this process, the department received more than 8,000 comments from interested parties. The final rule, though not perfect, is more equitable to all the nation's dairy farmers and pro-consumer. It is a good first step toward a policy that places the nation's dairy industry in a position to better meet the challenges of the global markets of the new century. 
   When we begin deliberations on the next farm bill, we will have an opportunity to review and develop additional market-oriented reforms for dairy policy. But, I am convinced that the Congress cannot improve upon the department's good-faith, balanced effort either in committee or on the Senate floor. If dairy farmers approve the new policy in referenda in their order areas, we should allow the final rule to be implemented on October 1, as scheduled, without intervening legislation and I will work toward that end.

   Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce the USDA Information Technology Reform and Year-2000 Compliance Act of 1999. This legislation aims to centralize all year 2000 computer conversion and other information technology acquisition and management activities within the Office of the Chief Information Office of the Department of Agriculture. Centralization is the most efficient way to manage the complex and important task of ensuring that all critical computer functions at the department are operational on January 1, 2000. It is also a wiser and more cost-effective way to construct an information technology infrastructure to enable USDA's hundreds of computer systems to interoperate, which unfortunately they cannot now do. 
   The Department of Agriculture is charged with enormous responsibilities and its year 2000 readiness is crucial. It has a diverse portfolio of over 200 Federal programs throughout the Nation and the world. The department delivers about $80 billion in programs. It is the fourth largest Federal agency, with 31 agencies and offices. The department is responsible for the safety of our food supply, nutrition programs that serve the poor, young and old, and the protection of our natural resources. Since more than 40 percent of the non-tax debt owed to the Federal Government is owed to USDA, the department has a responsibility to ensure the financial soundness of taxpayers' investments. 
   Responsibility for keeping the mission-critical information technology functioning should clearly rest with the Chief Information Officer. The decentralized approach to the year 2000 issue at USDA led to a lack of focus on departmental priorities. Each agency was allowed to determine what services, programs, and activities it deemed important enough to be operational at the end of the millennium. This decentralized approach also led to a lack of guidance, oversight and the development of contingency plans. Efforts to rectify this situation are well underway. I am pleased that Secretary of Agriculture Glickman has pledged his personal commitment to the success of year 2000 compliance and has made it one of the highest priorities for USDA. 
   In fiscal year 1999, USDA plans to spend more than $1.2 billion on information technology and related information resources management activities, including year 2000 computer compliance. The General Accounting Office has chronicled USDA's long history of problems in managing its substantial information technology investments. The GAO reports that such ineffective planning and management have resulted in USDA's wasting millions of dollars on computer systems. 
   Last year, I introduced S. 2116, a bill to reform the information technology systems of the Department of Agriculture. It gave the Chief Information Officer control over the planning, development, and acquisition of information technology at the department. Introduction of that bill and similar legislation in 1997 prompted some coordination of information technology among the department's agencies and offices. However, component agencies are still allowed to independently acquire and manage information technology investments solely on the basis of their own parochial interests or needs. This legislation is needed to strengthen that coordination and ensure that centralized information technology management continues in the future. 
   This legislation further requires that the Chief Information Officer manage the design and implementation of an information technology architecture based on strategic business plans that maximizes the effectiveness and efficiency of USDA's program activities. Included in the bill is authority for the Chief Information Officer to approve expenditures for information resources and for year 2000 compliance purposes, except for minor acquisitions. To accomplish these purposes, the bill requires that each agency transfer up to 10 percent of its information technology budget to the Chief Information Officer's control. 
   The bill makes the Chief Information Officer responsible for ensuring that the information technology architecture facilitates a flexible common computing environment for the field service centers based on integrated program delivery. The architecture will also provide maximum data sharing with USDA customers and other Federal and state agencies, which is expected to result in a significant reduction in operating costs. 
   Mr. President, this is a bill whose time has come. Unfortunately, USDA's problems in managing information technology are not unusual among Government agencies, according to the General Accounting Office. I commend the attention of my colleagues to this bill designed to address a portion of the information resource management problems of the Federal Government and ask for their support of it.

   Mr. LUGAR. Madam President, I thank the distinguished sponsor of this legislation, Senator MCCAIN, for yielding to me. I congratulate him on the resolution. I will advocate that the Senate should affirm the McCain resolution. Certainly, we should not table the resolution. 
   Madam President, a week after the war began, I wrote in the Washington Post:  
   We are losing the war in Kosovo. President Slobodan Milosevic and his Serbian Armed Forces are killing Kosovar political leaders, expelling Kosovars from their homes, and causing a flow of refugees into countries with few resources to care for them. The United States and NATO have the capacity to reverse this situation, but this will require presidential leadership and a commitment to taking the hard steps necessary to win.  
   I wrote, additionally, in the same column:  
   President Clinton still has the chance, as our Commander in Chief, to produce victory, even if what he advocated was based on a hopelessly incomplete vision of the end game and a dubious strategy to reach even severely limited aims.  
   Madam President, I wrote that on April 1--a month ago--and the situation is identical to that which I described then. We have an opportunity to win the war. We have an opportunity to come to the limited objective the President has listed, but this will require very, very substantial Presidential leadership, hard decisions on the part of our President, and support of those decisions by the American people, as represented by this Congress. 
   I come today not to argue procedure. I regret, as others do, that we are in a predicament of a 4-hour debate, and a tabling motion was announced in the national press. The leadership of both parties will advocate tabling and disposing of this resolution, thus ending the chapter until, presumably, a more appropriate time to discuss Kosovo. But I come not to lament that fact. It is part of our circumstances, and we shall have the vote in due course and I will vote ``no'' on the motion to table. 
   I come today not to argue whether we should specifically authorize the President to use air power, as they have done in the House by a 213-213 vote, to temporize on that issue, not on the issue of ground forces, nor whether we have to be consulted before there are ground forces, or any other forces. 
   We are presently talking about a situation in which the President has set forth some very limited objectives. In my 
   judgment, we have very little hope of meeting those limited objectives, and that translates into defeat for the United States of America, and for NATO. People talk about whether this is the right war, the war we were preparing for, whoever that may have been. We are in a war. It is a big war. It is the only war NATO ever had. It is an occasion for the North Atlantic treaty alliance to work, or for it to fail. 
   While we can fault our President and others while putting NATO at stake, and we can fault the President for failing to have the resources prepared; for a faulty diplomacy that produced one threat after another, which required some follow-through for credibility; for failure to say from the beginning we have to plan for every potential use of our resources, and we are doing so because we are intent upon coming to the right result. 
   All of that might have occurred. But, it did not. As I pointed out on April 1, it had not happened then, and it hasn't occurred since. But what has occurred is a very clear statement of objectives, and they are: the retreat, the withdrawal, the end of Serbian forces in Kosovo--out, all 43,000 of them, whether they are police, special police, regular armed forces, or paramilitary forces--these are the people, these particular Serbians, who, in fact, are killing people in Kosovo and expelling those they do not kill from their homes and their country. So, the first objective is all of these forces must leave Kosovo. 
   The second objective is the Kosovars must be allowed back in. There must be a condition in which people who have lost their loved ones, who have watched atrocities, who have suffered grievously and lost their identities, their bank accounts, their houses, to go back into their country where there has to be an international security force in which they believe--not in which we believe or that we temporize with others, and say a little bit of this or that country, a little balance here and there. The question will be: Do the Kosovars believe in it? Will they go back? If they do not, they are going to be in Macedonia, Albania, and increasingly in Italy, Germany, everywhere, spilling out all over Europe, hundreds of thousands of souls who require support--expensive people, people who could destabilize the economies and the governments of the host countries that have been so generous. 
   We have barely a month of humanitarian relief, and we understand how tragic it is for those people, how expensive and dangerous it is for the countries in the surrounding area. That has  already happened. You cannot walk away from that. We can take a resolution today and say this wasn't our war and we are tired of it or that we are bored with it or, as a matter of fact, we don't even want to participate anymore. But for the suffering people that are a consequence of this conflict, there is no walking away, and the consequences for us, for Europe, for NATO, for our Armed Forces morale, for civilian leadership intersecting with the Armed Forces, are very great. 
   So I am saying that you have to have an international force that gives confidence enough to the people who have lost almost everything to go back. There has to be money to pay for the houses they go back to, for the lights and the water, and the possibilities of making a living, and of some safety net of economic support while all that is happening. 
   Who will pay for that? Congressional leaders asked the President. He said the Europeans will take the preponderant share of that. I hope that is true. I hope the President has worked that out, or has broached that, or at least has some assurance of exactly how burdensharing will go--for humanitarian purposes or military purposes. This is terribly important and very expensive, and lying directly ahead, either in Kosovo, in Macedonia, Albania, or other countries. 
   Madam President, after these expelled people get back and the money is spent--and we hope to do much of this before the cold weather comes--as the President has pointed out with regard to the bombing raids in September and October--then at this point, negotiations proceed on the tortuous path on what kind of democracy in Kosovo, within the constraints of an autonomous province of Serbia but protected by an international force sufficiently strong, armed, and credible to the Kosovars so that they will come back and try to rebuild their country. That will be a very difficult negotiation. 
   If you were a Kosovar who had gone through all of this--and there are people advocating independence--the siren song of independence is pretty strong. Yet European countries all around are advocating no independence; that is not on the table. As the President has outlined our objective, independence is not on the table. It is autonomy, where people think about self-government within constraints. 
   Those are the objectives, narrow as they may be. Madam President, we had all better be giving a lot of thought as to how they might be met. 
   I believe that the McCain resolution is important because it says to the President, ``Mr. President, take all necessary ways and means to win, to find your objective, the objectives now shared by 18 other NATO allies.'' It is important that the President do that. 
   Normally, there might be a situation in which the President had planned for several months before the war in Kosovo to preposition equipment, to consider ground troops in Europe in addition to air resources, and other provisions, including provisions for humanitarian fallout that might occur. Ideally, all of that might have happened. But it didn't happen. As a matter of fact, the nation's attention was not on Kosovo, except from time to time throughout this period of time. And certainly there were no Presidential messages to the American people indicating the gravity of the situation, and very little debate here on the floor of the Senate. So that planning might have happened. But it did not. 
   We are now in a predicament where we are in a very large war, where the consequences are very great. We have limited objectives, but, in my judgment--I have expressed this candidly and personally to the President--we do not have the means to achieve those objectives. We have not had the means from the very beginning of the operation. 
   In his defense, the President stoutly affirms that the bombing campaign will do it, that you can get to those objectives with the bombing campaign alone. He would also add, some helpful information getting into a Serbia--some better control of that situation will be helpful. So would help by the Russians--and help by anybody, for that matter. But, nevertheless, the President from the beginning said no ground forces. He has followed up and said, ``I am not even planning for ground forces.'' He has almost taken pride in saying there will be no planning for ground forces; it is the bombing campaign. 
   I have said to the President respectfully, ``Mr. President, you have to have at least plan B. There has to be a safety net. We cannot suffer failure. You cannot suffer failure.'' There may be some Members of Congress--we read about these people in the paper who say, ``This is President Clinton's war, and when he falls flat on his face, that is his problem. He deserves it, having ill 
   prepared for this, having very little strategy that seems to be relevant to getting the job done.'' 
   Madam President, we got over that very rapidly. This is not the President falling on his face. It is not a personal failure of the President. We are in a war. The United States is at war--not President Clinton. 
   I think what Senator MCCAIN, Senator HAGEL, Senator BIDEN, and others have been saying in essence is, ``Mr. President, we need a much broader strategy. We need more options.'' 
   I have said specifically we need, at a minimum, a public declaration that we are planning ground options--lots of them. We don't know what the situation will be on the ground 5 months from now, but we had better have some options, and it had been better be apparent we are doing that, for our own credibility. 
   Furthermore, we could preposition supplies and equipment conspicuously so forces can get there, as opposed to constantly saying it will be weeks or months before we can do anything as an excuse for not doing so. 
   I am advised that the American people in various polls have a low tolerance for casualties. Some people have crassly suggested: What if 100 Americans lost their lives? Would you still be in favor of the war? Would you be in favor of ground forces? How about 200 or 500? At what point do you say, after America loses, we leave; that is an unacceptable set of circumstances? 
   In polls, however, it may test the political courage of the President, or any of us. If the President is failing even to say, ``I will think about planning for the ground option,'' because he is reading polls that say that is very unpopular, very unacceptable, then the President needs to get over that too, as we do here on the floor of the Senate. 
   We are talking now about the fate of our country--our credibility with regard to foreign policy and the Armed Forces. We can say, regardless of Kosovo, we are ready for the real war, or the big war, or whatever war comes along. But, Madam President, with what? What kind of political will? What kind of ability to pull this country together, and Congress, and the people? What kind of ability to keep the alliance together with some credibility that we are for real, and that when we go to war, we go to win? And having set the objectives, knowing very clearly what they are, we have to get to the point of winning. 
   The McCain resolution is tremendously important, because it simply says, ``Mr. President, you have got to do more--a lot more. You have to lead. You have to have a strategy that finally says to whomever--President Milosevic and anybody else--we are going to win, we are going to prevail, the United States means it.'' 
   If we are not prepared to give the President that support, if our debate degenerates into the fact that: ``Mr. President, we would like for you to win. We would like for the alliance to be credible. But do we think everything doesn't really work? We certainly don't want to do the ground forces option. We are not really sure about the money, the humanitarian relief, if the Europeans don't do their share. And we haven't worked it out with them. As a matter of fact, we don't know why we are there and why we got there, and we don't really want to know. We are tired of hearing about the history of this part of the world over the past thousand years. What we really want to know now is specifically, how do we get out of a bad dream?'' 
   As Senators, we are not movie critics. We are not taking a look at a scenario which is a bad dream. We have a responsibility, and the responsibility today is to vote no. The responsibility is to say that it is not simply the President who is responsible--the President's war, the President's plan, the President's request that, if somehow he is inadequate, we simply affirm  that and say how sad that he is inadequate. 
   Madam President, if we lose the war, the fact is, the Congress is inadequate. We also are elected by the people. We also have a constitutional responsibility and, when it comes to war, a responsibility to win. If the President needs shoring up, that may be our job. If the President needs concerted advice and support, we ought to provide it. 
   There could be other resolutions today, but we have in front of us a big one. 
   It does not come as a surprise that Senator MCCAIN's resolution has been well debated throughout the country, even if not here. What will be a surprise today, Madam President, is if Senators, Members of this body, are prepared to take some responsibility as opposed to arguing, as I have already heard, that the resolution is too broad, too sweeping, a blank check for a President in whom many Senators are not certain they have confidence to prosecute the war. 
   These are useful rationalizations before a war but not in the middle of one. It is a war, not just an exercise; however divorced it may be from our lives, that is not the case for those who are involved. 
   I am hopeful we will vote no on the tabling motion. I propose that we leave the options open to the President. I propose that as opposed to proscriptive motions--that, in the future we offer advice as to how we can help the President and we try to affirm that certain things should be done, as opposed to taking off the table the necessary means that he may need. 
   In response to my colleague from Pennsylvania, I am happy to yield for a question.

   Mr. LUGAR. I respond briefly to my colleague that I believe the President must begin to offer that leadership, that he must begin to offer the strategy. I find it unacceptable if we were, as critics of the President, simply to note that he has failed to do so. 
   In other words, it seems to me there is about this war a sense of unreality. Clearly, if we had been in the so-called cold war period and we were at war with another country at that point, and 
   the President apparently did not have an adequate strategy and we were losing, it would not be a useful question to ask why the President hasn't asked for what he needs. We have to say at that point that the President needs to ask. 
   We respectfully request the President to accept some advice and to accept some strategy that we have a responsibility to offer. 
   Simply left to an inadequate President, history would condemn him, but we would lose and the country would suffer grievous harm. That is our predicament in this situation. The President clearly hasn't asked for the authority, the arms, or whatever he needs. We are saying he needs to ask, and he needs to do so rapidly. We cannot sit around and simply wish that he did so and then lament that he failed to ask. We have a responsibility to act along with him. I hope and pray that he will do that. 
   I think the President, in this conversation the Senator cited, indicated he could ask General Shelton and General Shelton could produce a plan. In fact, allied armed services could be over there about 5 months and the President felt that might win the war. 
   We need to define very carefully, if that is the case, what the ground forces' objectives are, where they come in, and include all the options. In other words, that was a rather sweeping statement, but it has gone through the President's mind and what we are suggesting might have some impact. 
   I hope this debate pushes that forward. 
   I thank the Senator for his question.

    Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I rise to introduce The National Sustainable Fuels and Chemicals Act, with the goal of advancing biotechnologies likely to offer outstanding benefits in terms of strategic security, reduction of greenhouse gases and healthier rural economies. 
   At the heart of the National Sustainable Fuels and Chemicals Act is a novel research Initiative, jointly administered by the Secretary of Agriculture and the Secretary of Energy, that authorizes research for the purpose of overcoming technical barriers to low cost biomass conversion and gives priority funding to consortia composed of technical experts from academia, national laboratories, Federal research agencies and industry. By enhancing creative and imaginative approaches toward biomass processing, the Sustainable Fuels and Chemicals Research Initiative will serve to develop the next generation of advanced technologies making possible low cost biobased industrial products. 
   Innovative in both purpose and structure, the Initiative will promote integrated research partnerships as the best means of overcoming technical challenges that span multiple academic disciplines while also leveraging scarce Federal discretionary spending. 49 million dollars per annum is proposed for the Sustainable Fuels and Chemicals Research Initiative; funding is authorized for six years, through 2005. Given the potential benefits in improved national security, rural development and greenhouse gas reductions, this expenditure represents an investment in America's future and is in line with recommendations from a report of the President's Committee of Advisors on Science and Technology (PCAST). 
   The legislation will also coordinate and focus Federal research in cellulosic biomass processing through creation of the Sustainable Fuels and Chemicals Board consisting of senior representatives from the National Science Foundation, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Department of the Interior and the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy. Co-chaired by designees of the Secretary of Agriculture and Secretary of Energy, the Board shall coordinate research, development and demonstration activities relating to biobased industrial products between the Departments of Energy and Agriculture which are the two principal agencies for biotechnology research on fuels, chemicals and power. The Board will also serve to coordinate research activities across the many Federal agencies that are involved in research, regulation and policy formulation of fuels, commodity chemicals and power. 
   To advise the Secretary of Agriculture and Secretary of Energy on the technical focus and direction of the request for proposals issued under the research Initiative, a Sustainable Fuels and Chemicals Technical Advisory Committee is established. Modeled on the National Defense Sciences Board, the Advisory Committee consists of experts from academia, prominent engineers and scientists, representatives from commodity trade organizations and environmental or conservation groups. As an independent panel of technical experts, the Sustainable Fuels and Chemicals Technical Advisory Committee will serve an important role in the strategic planning and oversight of research carried out under the Initiative. 
   The case for promoting technology that will supply fuels, notably ethanol, chemicals and power from cellulosic biomass can be made independently of whether the world will continue to enjoy cheap oil. However, a wealth of scientific data indicates both that the world's supply of conventional oil is nearly half exhausted and that with each passing year, the demand for petroleum-derived energy increases. History gives us a clear warning that individual oil wells, oil fields, and national petroleum outputs have all shown a decline in production rates when the level of reserves reaches 50 percent. Balanced against both such `common sense' and Malthusian theory are optimists, including the late economist Julian Simon, who uses energy supplies as one example when arguing that natural resources have become more available rather than more scarce. 
   I would suggest that cellulosic biomass offers a unique opportunity for consensus between these seemingly unalterable opposing views. No longer is the debate centered on the delicate political and international issue of how best to divide the shrinking pie of world resources. Rather, application of the limitless supply of human ingenuity will be used to create a new and sustainable resource. In this regard, nature offers us the hint of a solution by demonstrating its own methods for harnessing power from the sun, nutrients in the soil and water, in support of a vast array of plant life. 
   Following nature's elegant example, engineers and scientists have developed biotechnologies 
   capable of breaking down nearly any form of plant, tree or grass into their constituent chemical building blocks, principally in the form of complex sugars. From this intermediate step, a wide variety of biobased industrial products including feed, fuels, chemicals, materials and power can be produced. With this capability, plants, trees, grasses and agricultural residues assume a new significance as a potential source of biobased industrial products. Significantly, cellulosic biomass is the only foreseeable sustainable source of organic fuels, chemicals and materials that find ubiquitous use in any modern economy. 
   Consider that biobased industrial chemicals can provide functional replacements for essentially all organic chemicals currently derived from petroleum, and have clear potential for product life cycles that are much more environmentally friendly than their fossil fuel counterparts. The new cellulosic conversion technology under development will contribute towards growth of what is now a fledgling industry centered on biobased products--including chemicals, lubricants, plastics, adhesives and building materials--with a market worth an estimated $300 billion per year in its infancy. 
   Biobased fuels such as ethanol have clear potential to be sustainable, low-cost and high performance, are compatible with both current and future transportation systems, and provide near zero net greenhouse gas emissions. The impact of bioethanol on greenhouse gas emissions is particularly significant because the transportation sector accounts for one-third of the total greenhouse gas emissions. Of the many contributing factors to possible climate change, the transportation sector is our most difficult challenge because of the ubiquitous dependence on greenhouse gas producing fossil fuels. Cellulosic ethanol, a renewable fuel derived from grasses, plants, trees and waste materials, offers a positive long-term approach to the problem of global warming that does not assume a shift from the automobile culture or increased costs for American employers and consumers. 
   Cellulosic ethanol is a versatile, liquid fuel and consequently will be able to use much of the existing infrastructure built over the last century in support of gasoline and internal combustion engines. The compatibility of water with biomass derived products,  including ethanol, is an important environmental consideration and a powerful demonstration of green chemistry. As my friend Jim Woolsey is fond of saying, ``If a second Exxon Valdez filled with ethanol ran aground off Alaska, it would produce a lot of evaporation and some drunk seals.'' 
   By providing farmers of the world the possibility of additional commodity products, whether dedicated crops or income from collection of agricultural residues, biomass processing can lead to healthier rural economies. A major strength of the new technologies for breaking down cellulosic biomass is that almost any type of plant, tree, or agricultural waste can be used as a source of fuel. This high degree of flexibility allows farmers the possibility of a cash crop simply by collecting their agricultural wastes. Local crops that enrich the soil, prevent erosion and improve local environmental conditions can be planted and then harvested for fuel. My firm belief is that innovations in biotechnology enabling the co-production of food, fuel, chemicals and materials from the sustainable supply of cellulosic biomass, are vital to the future of agriculture. 
   While undertaking this effort, I remain mindful that biofuels must be produced in ways that enhance overall environmental quality. Sound land-use policies must be followed to protect wildlife habitat and biological diversity concerns. But professional land-use techniques should readily accomplish this. 
   Providing an alternative fuel that will power the internal combustion engine of the automobile will help reduce our dependence on Middle Eastern oil without necessitating a rebuilding of the massive infrastructure built in support of gasoline. Reliance on the unstable states of the Middle East adversely impacts American strategic security, while massive oil imports skew our balance of payments. With the need for affordable energy rising with increasing population, and the transportation sector fueled almost exclusively by fossil fuels, the Middle East will control something approaching three-quarters of the world's oil in the coming century, providing that unstable region with a disproportionate leverage over diplomatic affairs. At a time when the United States confronts an ill-defined and confused drama of events on the international stage, including an increasingly assertive China, and nuclear and missile technology proliferation to North Korea, it seems clear we should dedicate a relatively small amount of money toward research that could lead to a revolution in the way we produce and consume energy. Or as presented by a distinguished panel of scientists and industrial experts in a recent PCAST report, ``. . . the security of the United States is at least as likely to be imperiled in the first half of the next century by the consequences of inadequacies in the energy options available to the world as by inadequacies in the capabilities of U.S. weapons systems.'' The report succinctly concludes, ``It is striking that the Federal government spends about twenty times more R&D money on the latter problem than on the former.'' 
   Before we are able to reap the significant benefits offered by biobased industrial products, the cost of the new conversion technology must be significantly reduced. Research and development is the only systematic means for creating the innovations and technical improvements that will lower the costs of biomass processing. Given the relatively short-term horizon characteristic of private sector investments, and because many benefits of biomass processing are in the public interest, industry is ill-equipped to fund the necessary fundamental research that will result in cost effective technologies for biomass conversion. 
   Research activities carried out by the Department of Agriculture, Department of Energy and other Federal agencies are a principal reason for much of the progress witnessed in biomass processing and underscore the future promise if new technology is developed. Nonetheless, coordination among the Federal agencies is disjointed and the research tends to be driven by institutional missions rather than by an overarching strategy to develop cost-effective technologies for biomass conversion. The National Sustainable Fuels and Chemicals Act is designed to overcome these shortcomings and raise the level of the Federal commitment to biotechnologies that are already demonstrating potential as powerful new alternatives to the traditional practices of the past. 
   In this effort, I am asking for the support of President Clinton and Vice President GORE who have indicated their commitment to the development of sustainable resources. On this issue we can develop a consensus for undertaking research that will improve our national security and balance of payments, reduce greenhouse gas emissions and strengthen rural economies in America and around the world. Working together we can promote the type of innovation-focused research essential for improvements in the utilization of America's biomass resource. It is my firm belief that future Americans will enjoy a rich return on our investment in the promise of a green revolution.

    Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I rise today to honor Hoosier and American veterans of Exercise Tiger. Exercise Tiger began as a top secret naval ``dress rehearsal'' for the impending Allied Invasion of Normandy. In the early morning of April 28, 1944, German warships attacked eight American tank landing ships (LST's) without warning during the exercise in the English Channel. Two American LST's were sunk, and a third was crippled. Of the 4,000-man force, 749 were lost in this short battle. 
   On April 23, Exercise Tiger veterans will be honored at Crown Hill Cemetery in Indianapolis, Indiana in commemoration of the 55th anniversary of the engagement. Tom Glynn, a retired US Navy veteran of Exercise Tiger, will lay a wreath at the grave of Frederick C. Carr, US Navy, LST-531, who died in the operation at Slapton Sands. The toll of a US Navy ship's bell will bring the ceremony to a close, ringing once for each of the eight ships involved in Exercise Tiger. 
   Because of the sensitive nature of the mission, veterans of Exercise Tiger were not properly recognized after the operation. Today's ceremony in Indianapolis is the first tribute in Indiana to honor the memory of fallen heroes of the battle. I ask my colleagues to join me today in honoring these courageous servicemen for their valiant service to the United States of America.

    Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, later this week NATO will honor its 50th anniversary at a Summit here in Washington, D.C. The leaders of the 19 NATO member nations and the heads of state of many Partnership-for-Peace participants will participate in meetings to discuss the successes of the NATO Alliance and its future in the post-Cold War world. 
   The more distant we become from the days of the fall of the Berlin Wall and the collapse of communism, the clearer it becomes that we have entered a new era. But dangers still abound in post-Cold War Europe. The ongoing conflict in Kosovo is a stark reminder that threats to the security of NATO's members still exist. The revolutions of 1989 not only led to the collapse of communism but also to the end of the peace orders established after two world wars. What is at stake today is order and stability in Europe as a whole. And that is why American interests are involved. 
   Mr. President, NATO cannot by itself solve all of Europe's problems. But without a stable security framework, we run the risk that reform and democracy in Eastern Europe will not persist but will instead be undercut by destructive forces of nationalism and insecurity. The failure of democracy in the East could not help but have profound consequences for democracy in the continent's western half as well. 
   The resolution that I submit today on behalf of Senators ROTH, LOTT, LIEBERMAN, DEWINE, VOINOVICH, and HAGEL sets forth three goals for the United States to achieve in discussions over the future of the NATO Alliance: (1) the enforcement of Article 10 of the Washington Treaty to remain open to the accession of additional members and a formal review of all applications for memberships; (2) expansion of the primary focus beyond threats from the east; and (3) the upgrading of our allies' ability to project power and to operate ``out of area.'' 
   NATO's ``open door'' policy toward new members established by Article 10 of the Washington Treaty, has given countries of Central and Eastern Europe the incentive to accelerate reforms, to peacefully settle disputes with neighbors, and to increase regional cooperation. Hopes of future membership in NATO has been a tremendous driving force of democratization and peace in Eastern and Central Europe including former Warsaw Pact nations. 
   To retract the ``open-door'' policy, as some have suggested, would risk undermining the tremendous gains that have been made across the region. The result of a ``closed-door'' policy would be the creation of new dividing lines across Europe. Those nations outside might become disillusioned and insecure and thus inclined to adopt the competitive and destabilizing security policies of Europe's past. 
   NATO's decision to enlarge in stages recognizes that not all new democracies and applicants in Europe are equally ready or willing to be security allies. Some states may never be ready. 
   The selection of future NATO members should depend on: (1) a determination by NATO members of their strategic interests; (2) NATO's perception of threats to security and stability; and (3) actions taken by prospective members to complete their democratic transitions and to harmonize their policies with NATO's political aims and security policies. 
   To reinforce the benefits of Article X, I believe a comprehensive review of the qualifications of the nine current applicant countries should be conducted under the guidelines laid out in the 1995 NATO Study on Enlargement. A review of this type would further demonstrate that NATO is actively considering a continuation of the enlargement process. Some believe that the Alliance is not interested in further enlargement; a formal review of the type I am suggesting would go far in reassuring NATO and non-NATO states of the Alliance's plans. Furthermore, a review would provide NATO aspirants with additional incentive to continue democratic, economic and military reforms. This is in the national security interests of the United States and NATO and should be encouraged. 
   These actions would also serve to clarify the security expectations of non-NATO members. It would make clear that it is the intention of the United States that NATO remain a serious defensive military alliance and not slip into a loose collective security society. It would suggest that enlargement will be a careful, deliberate process, with consideration of all security interests. Finally, it would draw again on the principle of reciprocity, both to encourage prospective members to align themselves with NATO's values and policies and to signal that threats levied against would-be members will be counterproductive. 
   A second goal enunciated in this resolution concerns the need to broaden NATO's focus. For nearly 50 years, NATO was oriented and organized to defend and respond to an attack from the East. An invasion by Soviet and Warsaw Pact forces was the primary threat facing the Alliance. Since the collapse of the Soviet Union, new threats have replaced the nightmare of Soviet armored divisions crashing through the Fulda Gap. The proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, rogue states, terrorism, ethnic strife, and other potentially destabilizing elements now threaten the Alliance. 
   It is a basic American interest that the Alliance not only enlarge to help stabilize Eastern Europe but that enlargement be part and parcel of a broader transformation that turns Europe into an increasingly effective strategic partner of the United States in and beyond the continent. 
   I believe this includes an improvement in the ability for NATO to operate outside the borders of its members. This is not a new mission. The potential for these types of endeavors has been present since NATO's inception. The true core of NATO has always been collective 
   defense, but Article 4 of the Washington Treaty suggests that NATO will consult and can act if the security of any of the Parties is threatened. This interpretation was reinforced by John Foster Dulles in May 1949 during Senate consideration of the Washington Treaty. Secretary of State Dulles testified that the occasions for consultation under Article 4 are not merely attacks in the Atlantic area dealt with by Article 5, but threats anywhere to any of the parties since the parties have interests and possessions throughout the world. So we are not talking about new NATO responsibilities; these types of actions were considered by the members of the Alliance and are supported by language in the treaty ratified by the Senate in 1949. 
   It is important to remember that participation in non-Article 5 missions is not obligatory and each NATO member is free to make an independent decision regarding participation in those missions. The United States and other NATO members are able to decide on the basis of their interests and an independent assessment of the situation whether to participate. This is as it should be. 
   A third goal set forth in this resolution deals with NATO members' capabilities. The collapse of the Soviet Union and the Warsaw Pact have altered the strategic and military landscape in which NATO forces will operate in the future. The potential for massive tank battles over the plains of Central Europe has been reduced. Instead military strategists believe the conflicts of the 21st century will require NATO members to rapidly deploy forces over long distances, sustain operations for extended periods of time and operate jointly with the United States in high intensity conflicts. 
   NATO developed a truly credible capability to defend itself from threats emanating from Central Europe and the former Soviet Union. But our allies have not moved far enough or fast enough to improve their capabilities to defend against newly emerging threats. In many cases these threats cannot be readily distinguished as either Article 5 or Article 4. 
   Today NATO faces threats to its southern borders and forces. For example, Turkey's borders are directly threatened by rogue states to its south. NATO has a credible plan to reinforce Turkey in the event of hostilities. Unfortunately, this plan relies heavily on  U.S. forces. If the U.S. were unable to provide the military apparatus necessary to implement this plan because of its involvement in operations elsewhere, the reinforcement blueprint would be in jeopardy. European forces lack serious power projection capabilities for demanding Article 5 missions, in addition to the potential for meeting Article 4 contingencies. 
   We must maintain and improve NATO's military force capability to respond to all conceivable missions. Our goal must be to enlarge NATO by enhancing NATO's strategic strength and military effectiveness. The need for improved European power projection capability becomes self-evident when one considers that the U.S. currently contributes only about 20% of NATO's total conventional forces, but provides about 80% of NATO's usable military capability for power projection missions. 
   We must reconfigure NATO to deal with the threats of the 21st century by requiring improved allied power projection forces for operating in a seamless web of situations including within NATO's enlarging borders, inside Europe including on its periphery, and outside Europe when the Alliance's vital interests are at stake.

   Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I rise today to join with my colleague from Indiana as a cosponsor of this Senate resolution commending the Purdue University women's basketball team on winning the 1999 National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) basketball championship. 
   The Lady Boilermakers this year have made Indiana history in becoming the first women's sport to bring home a national championship title for Purdue University. They are also the first women's basketball team in the Big Ten Athletic Conference to win the NCAA title. 
   This resolution is a fitting tribute and a deserving honor for Coach Carolyn Peck and the team members who persevered throughout the long season and the playoffs to win the national title. Their commitment and dedication to this tremendous effort is demonstrated by their winning record of 34 games--including a string of 32 consecutive victories. Throughout this storied season, the Lady Boilers' skill and dedication was matched only by the grace and dignity with which they carried themselves as a team en route to the national title. 
   For departing seniors Ukari Figgs and Stephanie White-McCarty, this victory is truly special as they complete their studies at Purdue and look toward the future. Winning the NCAA title is an historic and special occasion--placing this team among a select company of national champions. Their triumph will be remembered at Purdue and throughout our State for years to come. 
   The dedication and sportsmanship demonstrated throughout the season by the Lady Boilers reaffirm our strong basketball tradition in Indiana. The team's competitive spirit and commitment to excellence make them deserving recipients of the accolades of the nation and the honor of this special Senate resolution.

   Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce the ``Sanctions Policy Reform Act of 1999,'' a bill that would establish a more deliberative, commonsense approach to U.S. sanctions policy. I am joined by nearly thirty colleagues from both sides of the aisle. A companion bipartisan bill was introduced in the House of Representatives on March 24, 1999. We introduced a similar sanctions reform bill in the 105th Congress and gained thirty-nine co-sponsors in the Senate. 
   Our interest in reforming U.S. economic sanctions policy stems from a number of compelling and disturbing findings. The net effect of our self-imposed economic sanctions is that they deny access to U.S. markets abroad, reduce our trade balance, contribute to job loss, complicate our foreign policy and antagonize friends and allies. Unilateral economic sanctions are truly a blunt instrument of foreign policy.  
   Unilateral economic sanctions have become a policy of first use, rather than last resort, when pursuing a foreign policy objective. Sanctions are tempting alternatives to careful diplomatic negotiations and to the use of force to accomplish foreign policy goals. Unilateral economic sanctions have become more frequent in recent years and have been used against more countries, both friends and adversaries, for an increasing variety of actions which we find offensive. 
   Unilateral economic sanctions can give a competitive edge to foreign companies by precluding U.S. companies from exporting. Over time, foreign competitors will establish trade connections with a U.S. sanctioned country, solidify their trade ties and make it difficult for U.S. companies to re-enter those markets. This is costly to the U.S. economy, to American exports, to American jobs and to our overall foreign policy. 
   There have been a large number of studies on unilateral economic sanctions and they provide startling estimates of the sanctions' costs. The report of the President's Export Council, for example, cited 75 countries representing more than half of the world's population that have been subject to or threatened by U.S. unilateral economic sanctions. In another study, the Institute for International Economics concluded that, in 1995, alone, economic sanctions cost U.S. exports between $15-19 billion, and eliminated upwards to 200,000 U.S. jobs, many in high wage export sector. More recently, the administration revealed the results of its internal inventory of U.S. sanctions and found that there are now more than 280 identifiable sanctions provisions that are either in force or in law. 
   Unilateral economic sanctions rarely succeed in accomplishing their stated foreign policy objectives. Unilateral economic sanctions sometimes do more damage to our interests than to those against whom they are aimed. For this reason alone, we should re-think the way in which we manage our sanctions policy. 
   Mr. President, a cardinal principle of foreign policy is that when we act internationally, our actions should do less harm to ourselves than to others. Unilateral economic sanctions, unfortunately, often fail this crucial test of public policy. 
   In fact, Mr President, unilateral economic sanctions often impose long-term adverse effects on the U.S. economy. Once foreign competitors establish a presence in international markets that are abandoned by the United States, the potential losses can magnify. Over time, the cumulative effect of sanctions will not only include the loss of commercial contracts, but also the loss of confidence in American suppliers and in the United States as a reliable business partner. The frequent resort to unilateral economic sanctions to achieve foreign policy goals, however meritorious these goals may be, runs the risk of weakening our export performance which has contributed so greatly to our economic prosperity. 
   Mr. President, unilateral economic sanctions give the illusion of action by substituting for more decisive action or by serving as a palliative for those who demand that some action be taken--any action--by the United States against a country with whom we have a disagreement. Yet, the evidence is powerful that they rarely attain the foreign policy goals they are intended to achieve. 
   The bill we are introducing today includes a number of changes from last year's bill which we believe will strengthen the cause of sanctions reform. These new provisions include language that would provide the President more flexibility in meeting procedural requirements he would otherwise have to meet when considering new unilateral economic sanctions. The bill includes a permanent waiver authority on the Nuclear Prevention Proliferation Act of 1994, the so-called Glenn Amendment, which mandates the automatic imposition of sanctions on countries which detonate a nuclear device for weapons development. We also included an additional procedural ``speed bump'' to improve the deliberative process in the Congress. 
   Mr. President, our legislation is prospective. With only one exception, our bill does not affect existing U.S. sanctions. The only provision in our bill which reaches back to current unilateral economic sanctions gives the President permanent authority to waive the sanctions in the Nuclear Proliferation Prevention Act, the Glenn Amendment. Our bill applies only to unilateral sanctions and to those sanctions intended to achieve foreign policy or national security objectives. It would exclude, by definition, U.S. trade laws that have well-established procedures and precedents. The bill does not address the complex issue of state and local sanctions designed to achieve foreign policy goals. 
   Our proposed legislation does not prohibit unilateral economic sanctions or prevent a vote in the Congress on any proposed new sanction. There are situations where other foreign policy options have been exhausted and where the actions of other countries are so outrageous or so threatending to the United States and national interests that our response, short of the use of force, must be firm and unambiguous. In such instances, economic sanctions may be an appropriate instrument of American foreign policy. 
   Our legislation seeks to establish clear guidelines and informational requirements to help us improve our deliberations and to understand better the consequences of our actions before we implement new economic sanctions. We should know before voting or imposing any new sanctions what the costs and gains to the United States and our friends and allies are likely to be. There should be an analysis of the impact of any new sanctions on our reputation as a reliable supplier, the other policy options that have been explored, and whether the proposed sanctions are likely to contribute to the foreign policy objectives sought in the legislation. Comparable requirements are also mandated in the bill for those new sanctions contemplated by the President under his authorities. 
   If the Congress and the President decide to implement new sanctions, our bill requires periodic evaluations from the President detailing the degree to which the sanctions have accomplished U.S. goals, the impact they are having on our economic, political and humanitarian interests, and their effects on other foreign policy goals and interests. 
   The bill provides for more active and timely consultations between Congress and the President. It provides Presidential authority to permit the President to waive the procedural requirements he must otherwise meet if he exercises his current authorities to impose a new sanction. The waiver authority can be exercised if the President determines that it is in the national interests to do so. 
   Our bill includes a sunset provision which means that any new unilateral economic sanction must expire after 2 years duration unless the Congress or the President acts to re-authorize them. Too often sanctions have lingered on the books long after anyone remembers and long after they are having any effect. 
   It includes language on contract sanctity to help ensure that the United States is a reliable supplier, but it also includes appropriate exceptions to protect against contracts that might otherwise be illegal or contrary to U.S. interests. 
   Our bill gives special attention to American agriculture because American 
   farmers and ranchers face a disproportionate burden from U.S. economic sanctions. Agricultural commodities are our most vulnerable exports because they are the most easily replaced by other exporters. American exporters lose access to some fourteen percent of the world rice market, some ten percent of the world wheat market and some five percent of the world corn market due to our sanctions. 
   Because of this, we included discretionary authority in the bill to provide for compensatory agricultural assistance if agricultural markets are severely disrupted by the imposition of unilateral economic sanctions. No new appropriations would be required for this authority. The bill opposes the use of food and medicines as a tool of foreign policy, except in the most severe circumstances, and urges that economic sanctions be targeted as narrowly as possible on the targeted country in order to minimize harm to innocent people and humanitarian activities. 
   Let me reiterate that nothing in this bill prohibits new unilateral economic  sanctions or prevents a vote in the Congress on proposed new sanctions. The steps detailed in this bill provide for better policy procedures and more informed analysis so that proposed new sanctions are preceded by a more deliberative process by which the President and the Congress can make reasoned and balanced choices affecting the totality of American values and interests. 
   Mr. President, I feel strongly about this bill and this issue. It goes to the heart of the manner by which we conduct our commercial relations abroad and the way we manage our overall foreign policy. We need to do a better job on both. This legislation is designed to do just that. 
   I hope my colleagues will join me and the other original co-sponsors by taking a close look at this legislation and the reforms that we are attempting to accomplish. I welcome their support and believe that if we deal with the unilateral economic sanctions issue in a careful and systematic manner, we can make a significant positive contribution to the conduct of American foreign policy and to our national interest.

   Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill that will permit local school officials the opportunity to waive the cost requirements of foreign students studying in our public high schools in the United States on F-1 visas. The law now mandates that all foreign students who are not in a government-funded exchange program pay or reimburse the local school district the cost of their education. 
   In those public school districts flooded with foreign students who pay no taxes, this requirement makes good sense. However, in those school districts which enroll a small number of foreign students or experience little or no burden, there may be no desire for tuition reimbursement. The decision to enroll and to require cost reimbursement should be made at the local level. Current law, however, does not permit this local discretion. The bill I am introducing today will allow local school districts the chance to waive the requirement that foreign students pay for the cost of their education. The decision to waive or not waive this requirement should be made at the grassroots level where the problem, if any, exist, not in Washington. My bill seeks to preserve this principle. It would amend the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (IIRIRA). 
   Foreign exchange students bring knowledge, cultural exposure and understanding to American students, schools and communities. I have been a proponent of cultural and educational exchanges and have supported most international exchange programs over the years--both those which bring foreign visitors here and those which send American students, scholars and practitioners abroad. Most recently, my office participated in the Congress-Bundestag program. An intern from Germany worked in my office for several weeks and learned about how a Senate office functions. I remain committed to these exchange programs. They bring enormous benefits to our country as well as to the individuals. 
   In 1996, I supported the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act. This law states that as of November 30, 1996, IIRIRA prohibits any alien from receiving an F-1 student visa to attend a public elementary school, grades K-8, or a publicly-funded adult education program unless they pay the unsubsidized, per capita cost of their education in advance. My bill would not change current law relating to elementary schools or adult education. It would not pertain to students on 
   formal, government-funded international exchanges such as those managed by the State Department, the USIA and many other federal government agencies. It would simply allow high school officials to waive the cost of the education of high school-level foreign students if that was their own choice. 
   Several municipalities have ``Sister City'' arrangements between American cities and cities in foreign countries. One valuable component of these arrangements is an exchange program for high school students enabling American youth to spend a year in a foreign high school while students from abroad spend a year in a high school here. No tuition is generally exchanged under the sister city agreement, but current U.S. law states that visitors to our country must pay the unsubsidized cost of their education, even though American students attending schools abroad are exempted from the cost requirement. 
   Along the Alaska-Yukon, Alaska-British Columbia and U.S.-Mexican borders there are schools serving very remote communities on both sides of the border. After enactment of the 1996 law, Canadian or Mexican students were no longer eligible to enter the United States to attend local public schools even though governments and the local school districts agreed to enroll the students. 
   Many school districts choose to enroll one or two exchange students a year. Reciprocal exchange agreements are beneficial and host families enjoy these students in their homes. American exchange students attending schools in Germany, for example, are not subjected to the same tuition requirements for their schooling, yet they gain an understanding of German history and culture and benefit from their travels. Currently, U.S. law requires foreign students to pay their tuition before they arrive in the United States. The extra paper work, the up-front costs and the extra burden these requirements place on foreign students tend to undermine the purpose of cultural exchanges. 
   I remain mindful to past abuses of F-1 visas and am sympathetic to the burden that large enrollments of foreign students place on American public schools. My purpose in introducing this bill today is not to weaken the law as it currently reads, but to provide an outlet for our schools to have an opportunity for enrolling international exchange students. 
   Last year, I was successful in getting similar legislation passed in the Senate. Unfortunately, it was dropped in conference. This bill has the support of many Senators, of the Department of Education, Department of State and the USIA as well as most U.S. non-governmental organizations interested in immigration, student exchanges, public education. It is my hope that the Senate will once again pass this bill. 
   Mr. President, I ask that the bill be included in the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD.

    Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA). I'm pleased to be joined by Senators MCCAIN, GRAMM, HAGEL, DEWINE and GRAMS as original cosponsors. Our bill is designed to provide a broad U.S. policy framework towards the nearly fifty countries in sub-Sahara Africa. Specifically, the bill seeks to develop active partnerships with African countries through a set of trade and investment initiatives and incentives in exchange for a commitment from those countries to make the transition to market economies. 
   For decades U.S. policy towards Africa was based largely on a series of bilateral aid relationships. Our involvement in Africa was influenced by strategic considerations inherent in the cold war. Our assistance programs targeted humanitarian crises and natural disasters and they helped nurture a variety of health, nutritional, educational and agricultural programs. As important as these programs have been, they have not promoted much economic development, fostered much self-reliance or promoted political stability for the vast majority of the people of sub-Sahara Africa. Nor have they particularly benefitted the American economy. For these reasons, it is long past due that the United States re-evaluate this policy. That is the purpose of our bill. 
   Last year, a similar bill was introduced and passed in the House of Representatives but did not reach the floor of the Senate. The bill has been introduced last month in the House and the House committees have been active. Already, the bill is scheduled to be reported by both the Ways and Means and International Relations Committees very soon. I understand that it is scheduled for a floor vote in the House in the next several weeks. 
   The Administration supports this legislation because it mirrors its own initiatives on Africa. Indeed, President Clinton cited the initiative and the bill in his last two State of the Union addresses before the Congress. Virtually all African Ambassadors have endorsed this bill and are committed to working to pass and enact it this year. Our bill enjoys support within the American business community and among many non-governmental organizations involved in Africa. 
   Mr. President, the AGOA is intended to promote greater economic self-reliance in Africa through enhanced private sector activity and trade incentives for those countries meeting eligibility requirements and wishing to participate. The bill authorizes the President to grant duty-free treatment to certain products currently excluded from the GSP program, subject to the sensitivity analysis of the International Trade Commission. It extends the GSP program for Africa for 10 years, a provision which is important for long-term business planning. 
   The bill also would increase access to U.S. markets for African textiles and other products. It would remove U.S. quotas on African textile imports which now amount to less than one percent of our worldwide textile imports. The bill includes unusually strong transshipment language that is the toughest ever proposed. The U.S. International Trade Commission estimated last year that reducing tariffs on textiles from Africa would have a negligible effect on our economy but would give a high boost to Africa's fledgling manufacturing base. The jobs and foreign exchange earnings that would be gained in Africa under this initiative will enable Africans to purchase more products from the United States. 
   In my judgement, the AGOA is a modest bill which, if adopted, could have immodest results in Africa. It takes a long-term view and provides a policy road map for achieving economic growth and opportunity. It will take some time for the initiatives embedded in this legislation to have a measurable impact on economic growth in Africa. Nonetheless, we need to look ahead over the next 
   decades and to assist wherever possible in the development of those areas that have not been successfully or fully integrated into the world economy. Much of Africa falls into this category. My bill is intended to help facilitate that transition. Strategic planning now will help create a better, more productive and prosperous future. 
   Mr. President, our bill includes a number of other attractive provisions. It includes two new private sector financed funds--an equity fund and an infrastructure fund both of which would be backed by the Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC). If successful, these funds will lead to improvements in such areas as African roads, telecommunications and power plants each of which can accelerate economic activity in Africa. It includes provisions for enhanced visibility for Africa in our international deliberations on trade and finance and increased technical assistance for economic management. It establishes a Forum to facilitate high level discussions on trade and investment policies between the U.S. and Africa. 
   Most importantly, our bill signals the start of a new era in U.S.-African relations based less on bilateral aid ties and more business relationships, less on paternalism and more on partnerships, and one that builds upon the long term prospects of African societies rather than on short-term, reactive policies. 
   Many African societies have been undergoing impressive political and economic transformations. Africa's economic potential is substantial. There are more than 600 million people in sub-Sahara Africa, but Africa's share of foreign annual direct investment commands less than two percent of global direct investment flows. Much of that capital comes from Europe which has an established market and investment presence in Africa. Nonetheless, several African countries enjoy sustained economic growth at or above 6%, despite the strains in the global economy that began in Southeast Asia and spread to other parts of the world. Indeed, U.S. Trade with sub-Sahara Africa exceeds our trade with all the states of the former Soviet Union combined and the potential for expansion will grow as these economies expand and mature. 
   The enhanced trade and private investment benefits in the bill will be available to all African societies but especially to those countries which undertake sustained economic reform, maintain acceptable human rights practices and make progress towards good governance. These standards are similar to those applied in other parts of the world. Indeed, without these standards the private sector would be unlikely to invest in Africa. 
   The United States can play a significant role in helping promote Africa development. We have a historic opportunity to help integrate African countries into the global economy, to re-think dependency on foreign assistance and to help strengthen civil society and economic and political institutions. No one believes this bill is a panacea for Africa, but it is very much in our interests to play a constructive role in the evolving economic transition in Africa. If the United States has the vision to be a major player in Africa's economic and political improvement, we will also be a major beneficiary. If we are successful, Africa will provide new trade and investment opportunities for the United States. It will also improve the quality of life for a broader segment of the people of Africa, a goal we must all support and applaud.

   Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, during the Cold War, the United States co-existed with the Soviet Union in a strategic environment characterized by high-risk but low-probability of a ballistic missile exchange between the two countries involving nuclear, chemical and biological weapons. 
   Today, however, with the dissolution of the Soviet Union and the end of the cold war, the opposite is the case--we live in a lower-risk but higher-probability environment with respect to ballistic missile exchanges. In other words, even as the probability of a large-scale nuclear exchange between the United States and Russia has mercifully declined, the probability that one or several weapons of mass destruction might be used to attack the American homeland or American forces at home or abroad has increased. 
   Indeed, absent a U.S. response to the proliferation of ballistic missiles and weapons of mass destruction that is as focused, serious, and vigorous as America's cold war deterrent strategy to protect the American homeland and the West, Americans can anticipate the threatened as well as the actual use of diverse weapons delivery systems to attack the U.S. homeland in the future. 
   Missile defense must be a part of that response. For that reason, I am pleased to be an original cosponsor of the legislation before us and commend Senator COCHRAN for his leadership on this issue.  
   Let me explain my strong support for this bill. 
   Missile defense is not a silver bullet that, by itself, can adequately protect the United States from the enhanced threats posed by ballistic missile proliferation and the spread of weapons of mass destruction. But it is an important component that gives added credibility to the other elements of our strategy. 
   I approach the response to these threats to American security through the prism of ``defense in depth.'' There are three main lines of defense against emerging ballistic missile threats and weapons of mass destruction. Together, they help form the policy fabric of an integrated defense in depth. 
   The first line of defense is preventing proliferation at potential sources abroad. The second is deterring and interdicting the flow of illicit trade in these weapons and materials. The third line of defense is ``homeland defense'' and involves programs that run the gamut from preparing domestically for WMD crises to protection against limited ballistic missile attacks. 
   With respect to the initial line of defense, the United States is implementing programs that address the threat posed by weapons of mass destruction at the greatest distance possible from our borders and at the most prevalent source, the former Soviet Union. While much more remains to be done, the Nunn-Lugar Scorecard is impressive. Nunn-Lugar has facilitated the destruction of 344 ballistic missiles, 286 ballistic missile launchers, 37 bombers, 96 submarine missile launchers, and 30 submarine launched ballistic missiles. It also has sealed 191 nuclear test tunnels. Most notably, 4,838 warheads that were on strategic systems aimed at the United States have been deactivated. All at a cost of less than one-third of one percent of the Department of Defense's annual budget. Without Nunn-Lugar, Ukraine, Kazakstan, and Belarus would still have thousands of nuclear weapons. Instead, all three countries are nuclear weapons-free. 
   The second line of defense against these threats involves efforts to deter and interdict the transfer of such weapons and materials at far-away borders. Nunn-Lugar and the U.S. Customs Service is working at the borders of former Soviet states to assist with the establishment of export control systems and customs services. In many cases these nations have borders that are thousands of miles long, but local governments do not have the infrastructure or ability to monitor, patrol, or secure them. These borders are particularly permeable, including points of entry into Iran on the Caspian Sea and other rogue nations. 
   We must continue to plug these porous borders abroad. These nations are seeking our help and it is in our interests to supply it. Secure borders in this region of the world would strengthen our second line of defense and serve as another proliferation choke-point. 
   The third line of defense involves the United States preparing domestically to respond to these threats. That is the purpose of the 1996 Nunn-Lugar-Domenici Defense Against Weapons of Mass Destruction Act. This law directs professionals from the Department of Defense, Federal Bureau of Investigation, Department of Health and Human Services, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, and others to join into partnerships with local emergency professionals in cities across the country. The Pentagon intends to supply training and equipment to 120 cities across the country over the next four years. To date, 52 metropolitan areas have received training to deal with these potential threats. 
   We must take those steps necessary to protect the American people from these threats and Nunn-Lugar and Nunn-Lugar-Domenici make powerful contributions to our efforts. We have made significant progress in reducing these threats and constructing a defense-in-depth. But a complete defense-in-depth must include protection from missile attack. 
   I was pleased to see this common-sense, bipartisan approach to the missile defense issue embodied in the Cochran bill. The bill states: ``It is the policy of the United States to deploy as soon as technologically possible a national missile defense system capable of defending the territory of the United States against limited ballistic missile attack.'' 
   This bill offers a new approach to the missile defense policy debate. It does not specify a specific system architecture or deployment dates which have bogged down previous legislative proposals. 
   The national missile defense system promoted both in this legislation would not be capable of defending against thousands of warheads being launched against the United States. Rather, we are planning a system capable of defending against the much smaller and relatively unsophisticated ICBM threat that a rogue nation or terrorist group could mount as well as one capable of shooting down an unauthorized or accidentally launched missile. 
   At minimum, the recent revelations over Chinese nuclear espionage suggests that China is intent on building its military capabilities to a point that exceeds the projections and assessments of the U.S. military and intelligence community. The Cox committee findings have done for American appreciation of the potential Chinese nuclear threat what the Rumsfeld Commission did for our knowledge of North Korean and Iranian capabilities. And like the latter, the former may highlight the need to review the impact of such enhanced nuclear capabilities on our existing assumptions and requirements with respect to a limited ballistic missile defense system. Illicit acquisition and testing of the design for the W-88 nuclear warhead strongly suggests that the Chinese are modernizing their strategic force and using such tests to develop mobile missiles to possibly penetrate missile defense. 
   Acquisition of United States nuclear warhead technology will give China a major boost in its strategic capability when added to other recent improvements to its long-range missiles. Indeed, possession of the design of the W-88 would have helped China advance toward key strategic goals. Equally important, China's possession of the design of advanced United States warheads poses a proliferation risk. Such warheads have features that could prove useful to aspiring nuclear weapons states. In brief, if China shared W-88 warhead design information with nations like North Korea, Pakistan, or Iran, they could develop and deploy a more potent nuclear force in a shorter period of time. 
   Lastly, lighter, smaller warheads in the Chinese nuclear arsenal will increase the range of Chinese missiles and make it easier for submarine-launched ballistic missiles to hit the United States. And this, in turn, could make a strategic difference if the United States and China were once again to come to odds over Taiwan. Certainly, it could have an impact on the efficacy of any American plans to include Taiwan--or Japan for that matter--in any regional missile defense system. 
   In short, these recent revelations should force us to reconsider a number of the 
   assumptions and resulting requirements that underlie our thinking both on theater as well as national missile defense. The recent report by the Rumsfeld Commission raised serious doubts about the core assumptions that undergird administration policy for developing a national missile defense systems and for considering amendments to the ABM Treaty. The Cox committee report not only called into question other core assumptions but also the requirements for an effective, if limited, national missile defense system. 
   The Rumsfeld Commission took an independent look at the critical question of warning time and not only dissented from the intelligence community's estimates but struck at the core of the administration's ``3+3'' policy by finding that a ballistic missile threat to the United States could emerge with little or no warning over the next 5 years. 
   Even before the Rumsfeld Commission issued its report, Senator COCHRAN, along with Senator INOUYE, introduced the legislation before us. It directs the deployment of effective anti-missile defenses of the territory of the United States as soon as ``technologically feasible.'' By making a missile defense deployment decision dependent on technical readiness as opposed to intelligence estimates about emerging threats and warning time, this legislation appeared to many to take an approach to missile defense that is fundamentally different from  the administration's policy. Indeed, critics of the Cochran bill have gone out of their way to try and paint major differences with the administration's policy. 
   The Cochran bill attempts to determine whether and how our current policy on national missile defense should be changed in light of the growing disutility of warning time and intelligence estimates as triggers for deployment decisions. While critics may argue that the Cochran bill neither provides a clear answer to that question or a clear policy alternative to that of the administration, it does propose that a deployment decision rest on more than whether a national missile defense system simply is ``technologically feasible''. The Cochran bill also sensibly insists that the national missile defense system be effective ``against limited ballistic missile attacks (whether accidental, unauthorized, or deliberate)'' before it is deployed. 
   The Cochran bill is a statement of intentions, not a policy map, and it represents not an escape from but rather a recognition of the difficult intelligence and policy problems with respect to the kinds of emerging ballistic missile threats, the time-frame for their emergence, and what we should do about them. 
   So the Cochran bill recognizes that there will remain the tough policy and intelligence questions that cannot be ducked. The 1972 ABM Treaty was intended to preclude the kind of nationwide missile defenses that could undermine the credibility of a large second strike deterrent, using measures based on technology over 25 years ago. In 1999, both the threats and the technology have changed. The threat posed by the proliferation of ballistic missiles is clearest, ant the ABM Treaty should not be allowed to interfere with programs to deploy effective defenses. 
   Equally important, there is nothing in the Cochran bill that would prevent us from engaging the Russians in discussions about modifying the ABM Treaty to permit effective national defenses against the kinds of missile attacks that should constitute the post-cold-war threat of concern to both countries. If these exchanges are not successful, then consideration can be given to withdrawing from the agreement. 
   Finally, critics of the Cochran bill complain both about the timing of the bill as well as the message its sends to the Russians. Three points are worth making. First, for the critics there is never a good time to take up missile defense and in this they are joined by the Russians. And to the great surprise of absolutely no one, the Russians have announced that the Duma might be prepared to take up START II again. With Russian Prime Minister Primakov on his way to Washington, I would say that the timing is just about right. 
   The administration must be more forthcoming with Russia on the issue of missile defense. It must explain to Moscow that this defense is not meant as a threat or an attempt to neutralize Russia. Rather, we are attempting to protect ourselves from the machinations of rogue states and terrorist groups. In my trips to Russia and in visits with Russian legislators and members of the Yeltsin Government, I have continued to inform them of a simple fact: America will protect itself. 
   The Russians--and the world--need to understand that we will proceed with non-proliferation, domestic preparedness, and missile defense to protect the American people against an attack from a rogue state or terrorist group or an accidental or unauthorized attack by another nation. 
   Secondly, Russian nuclear reductions and eliminations are continuing and even accelerating with American help despite the absence of START II ratification. To the extent that those eliminations become constrained, it will be for reasons of resources, not lack of Duma approval of START II. 
   Thirdly, critics of the Cochran bill would argue that the congressional expression of intent embodied in the legislation regarding deployment of a limited missile defense system will prejudice any chances of negotiating appropriate adjustments in the ABM Treaty with the Russians to accommodate such defenses. There I disagree! It is precisely because many Russians have doubted the serious intent of the Clinton administration in actually proceeding with a limited deployment under the ``3+3'' plan that we have been treated to dire predictions out of Moscow about the ``end of arms control'' were the United States to ultimately proceed with missile defense. 
   Rather than prejudicing any opportunity to negotiate changes in the ABM Treaty, I believe that the statement of intent embodied in this legislation to ultimately defend ourselves against limited ballistic missile attacks is a prerequisite to successful ABM modification negotiations. It has never been our technological prowess nor our ability to amass and apply resources to a problem that the Russians have doubted; it has been our political will that has been suspect in Russian eyes when the choices to be made were difficult ones. 
   In conclusion, the ballistic missile threat to our security interests is real. But it is also complex. The Cochran bill recognizes these realities. But the bill also recognizes that it is not the only threat we face nor can it be addressed in isolation from other major security issues and policies. 
   As Senator COCHRAN said, this legislation represents not the end of the missile defense policy and program debate but rather the beginning. If I recall correctly where the two parties stood on the issue of missile defense even a year or two ago, I am struck by the efforts of a few dedicated Members on both sides to bridge the gap in our legislative approaches in the interest of addressing the growing vulnerability of the American homeland to ballistic missile attacks. We have come a considerable distance in the last year in narrowing our differences. Senate passage by a strong majority of this expression of policy intent with regard to the ultimate deployment of an effective limited missile defense system is a measured but essential first step.

   Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce legislation to open foreign markets, eliminate unfair trade barriers and secure for farmers the ability to export their products abroad. By enacting the 1996 FAIR Act, commonly known as Freedom to Farm, we gave farmers to freedom to make planting decisions for themselves, free from government controls. However, Freedom to Farm is a compact. Freedom to Farm means freedom to export, and in exchange for phasing out subsidies, Congress committed to secure free, fair and open markets for our farmer's exports. This legislation will improve opportunities to export at a time when such opportunities are more important than ever for U.S. agriculture. 
   No sector of the economy is more reliant on international trade than agriculture. Approximately three out of ten acres of domestic agriculture production are sold in markets outside of the U.S. and agricultural exports make a positive impact on our international balance of payments. Despite this success, a great deal of untapped export potential still exists. Farmers are reliant on the ability to export and this legislation will enhance that ability. Barriers need to be removed--barriers we impose on ourselves and barriers imposed by others. 
   This legislation addresses several items but none is more important than sanctions. This legislation exempts commercial agricultural exports from unilateral economic sanctions. We impose export barriers on ourselves when we unilaterally sanction foreign countries. Such sanctions do not preclude the targeted country from looking elsewhere for agricultural commodities. U.S. competitors quickly fill the void left when the U.S. denies itself market access. Sales are lost and our status as a reliable business partner suffers. We often do more harm to ourselves than we do to the target country. Unilateral sanctions have cost billions of dollars in U.S. income and have cost thousands of U.S. jobs. We must end the practice of closing foreign markets for our own exports at a time when such exports are more vital than ever for agriculture in this country. 
   Apart from sanctions, a number of barriers are imposed on U.S. farm exports by other countries. The World Trade Organization will hold an important round of agricultural negotiations later this year in Seattle. These negotiations offer an important opportunity to address tariff and non-tariff barriers to U.S. agricultural exports. We must take advantage of this opportunity to open foreign markets and eliminate unfair export barriers. This legislation provides important guidelines for these and other negotiations.

   Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I am introducing today a bill to address what has become an increasingly heavy burden for middle-income taxpayers: the Alternative Minimum Tax, or AMT. My bill would retroactively index to inflation the exemptions used to calculate an individual taxpayer's AMT liability. The indexation would begin in 1993--the last time these exemptions were raised. The AMT is conspicuous for its lack of indexation. Under the regular income tax, the tax rate structure, the standard deductions, the personal exemptions, and certain other structural components are indexed so that taxpayers are not pushed into higher income tax brackets just because their income has kept pace with the cost of living. 
   The Joint Tax Committee estimates that in 1997, 605,000 taxpayers were subject to the AMT. According to these same estimates, which take into account the changes in the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997, taxpayers subject to the AMT could total 12 million by 2007. This is an increase of more than 1,800 percent in the number of taxpayers paying this particular tax. According to the Joint Tax Committee, this dramatic expansion of the AMT's reach can largely be attributed to the lack of indexation of the AMT exemptions. 
   The AMT was created in 1969 after a Treasury Department study revealed that 155 individuals who had annual incomes in excess of $200,000 had avoided paying taxes because of loopholes in the tax code. We can all agree that upper-income individuals should pay their fair share of taxes. The AMT was created effectively to be a tax on the use of incentives and preferences to reduce an individual's income tax liability. However, since its implementation, the AMT has inadvertently created larger tax burdens for the middle-class, who were never meant to be subject to the AMT.

   Mr. LUGAR. Mr. Chief Justice, for the first time in 120 years, and only for the second time in U.S. history, the Senate is about to conclude a Presidential impeachment trial. Our Founding Fathers viewed the power to remove a President as a necessary constitutional safeguard, but they wanted to make certain that the process was sufficiently difficult that the will of the voters would be overturned only for the gravest of reasons. They wrote the words ``high crimes and misdemeanors'' as a threshold, but left it to us to determine what transgressions met this standard. All of us have endeavored to fulfill this enormous responsibility. 
   From the beginning of the consideration of impeachment last year, many Members of Congress in both parties have made public statements expressing their opinions that the President lied to a federal grand jury and that he obstructed justice on numerous occasions. These judgments are apparently shared by large majorities of the American people as illustrated in frequent public opinion polls. The same polls have consistently found that a large majority of Americans do not want the President to suffer the Constitutional consequence of these breaches of law, namely, removal from office. 
   Since the House voted for impeachment, almost all 45 Democrats and some Republicans in the Senate have voiced their skepticism about voting to remove President Clinton from office. Early in the trial, 44 Democrats voted to dismiss the impeachment proceedings outright. Thus, a two-thirds majority vote needed for a guilty verdict has never been a likely outcome of the trial. 
   In the background, most Senate Democrats and several Republicans have worked on a motion to censure President Clinton. Our distinguished colleague, Senator FEINSTEIN, drafted a censure resolution that attracted substantial bipartisan support and was published in the New York Times of February 6, 1999. It stated:  
   Whereas William Jefferson Clinton, President of the United States, engaged in an inappropriate relationship with a subordinate employee in the White House, which was shameless, reckless and indefensible; 
   Whereas William Jefferson Clinton, President of the United States, deliberately misled and deceived the American people and officials in all branches of the United States Government; 
   Whereas William Jefferson Clinton, President of the United States, gave false or misleading testimony and impeded discovery of evidence in judicial proceedings; 
   Whereas William Jefferson Clinton's conduct in this matter is unacceptable for a President of the United States, does demean the Office of the President as well as the President himself, and creates disrespect for the laws of the land; 
   Whereas President Clinton fully deserves censure for engaging in such behavior; 
   Whereas future generations of Americans must know that such behavior is not only unacceptable but also bears grave consequences, including loss of integrity, trust and respect; 
   Whereas William Jefferson Clinton remains subject to criminal and civil actions; 
   Whereas William Jefferson Clinton's conduct in this matter has brought shame and dishonor to himself and to the Office of the President; and 
   Whereas William Jefferson Clinton, through his conduct in this matter, has violated the trust of the American people: Now, therefore, be it 
   Resolved, That the United States Senate does hereby censure William Jefferson Clinton, President of the United States, and condemns his conduct in the strongest terms.  
   Citizens might ask how a Senator could vote for a resolution stating that President Clinton ``deliberately misled and deceived the American people and officials in all branches of the United States Government'' and ``gave false or misleading testimony and impeded discovery of evidence in judicial proceedings'' and yet fail 
   to vote ``guilty'' on articles of impeachment that specifically mention perjury and obstruction of justice. The answer to that question is at the heart of understanding the Senate trial. 
   With few exceptions, Senators recognize that the Constitution gives only one outcome to a verdict of ``guilty,'' namely, removal from office. At the same time, many Senators are shocked by conduct which they call ``shameless, reckless, and indefensible,'' and they want their constituents to know that they have not been fooled or overwhelmed by Presidential charm. They have taken the initiative to explicitly denounce the bizarre conduct and the extraordinary corruption of this President. Members of both parties have deplored the fact that the President conducted an illicit sustained physical sexual relationship in spaces close to the Oval Office and publicly denied this to his family, his staff, and in televised statements to the world only to see all of the elaborate cover-up collapse after DNA tests on the dress of a young woman. 
   But the impeachment trial of President Clinton is not about adultery. The impeachment trial involves the President's illegal efforts to deny a fair result in the suit brought by Ms. Paula Jones. I have no doubt that the President worked deliberately to deny justice in this suit. In doing so, he lied to a federal grand jury and worked to induce others to give false testimony, thus obstructing justice. 
   Ms. Jones has often been described as a small person in our judicial system. In contrast, the President, who at the time of his inaugural takes a solemn oath to preserve and protect equal justice under the law for even the most humble of Americans, is a giant figure. As Senators who also take a solemn oath, we must ask ourselves the fundamental question: ``Is any man or woman above the law?'' 
   The legal defense team for the President does not admit that there is adequate proof of either perjury or obstruction of justice. They contend that Senators must embrace a theory of ``immaculate obstruction'' in which jobs are found, gifts are concealed, false affidavits are filed, and the character of a witness is publicly impugned, all without the knowledge or direction of the President, who is the sole beneficiary of these actions. The President's lawyers further contend that such crimes are, in any event, insufficient to remove the President. The drafters of the Constitution would have rejected these rationalizations for the indefensible Presidential misconduct at issue. They were political men with a profound reverence for the sanctity of the oath and our entire system of justice. They did not suggest that Senators park their common sense and their stewardship for the security of our country at the Senate door as they entered into an impeachment trial.  
   In fact, we have discovered in this trial that the founding fathers wanted the Senate to act as ``triers'' of fact and in the roles of both trial court and jury. Most importantly, they wanted us to act as guardians of the Constitution and thus the liberty and the rights under law of each individual American. Liberty itself is directly threatened when a President subverts the very judicial system that secures those rights. 
   During this trial, I have concluded that the prosecutors made their case. I will vote to remove President Clinton from office not only because he is guilty of both articles of impeachment, but also because I believe the crimes committed here demonstrate that he is capable of lying routinely whenever it is convenient. He is not trustworthy. Simply to be near him in the White House has meant not only tragic heartache for his wife and his daughter but enormous legal bills for staff members and friends who admired him and yearned for his success but who have been caught up in his incessant ``war room'' strategies to maintain him in office. Senator FEINSTEIN begins her censure resolution with the appropriate word ``shameless.'' The President should have simply resigned and spared his country the ordeal of this impeachment trial and its aftermath. 
   We have been fortunate that this damaged presidency has occurred during a time of relative peace and prosperity. In times of war or national emergency it is often necessary for the President to call upon the nation to make great economic and personal sacrifices. In these occasions, our President had best be trustworthy--a truth teller whose life of principled leadership and integrity we can count upon. Some commentators have suggested that with the President having less than two years left in his term of office, the easiest approach is to let the clock expire while hoping that he is sufficiently careful, if not contrite, to avoid reckless and indefensible conduct. But as Senators, we know that the dangers of the world constantly threaten us. Rarely do two years pass without the need for strong Presidential leadership and the exercise of substantial moral authority from the White House. 
   Of particular concern are the implications of the President's behavior for our national security. As Commander-in-Chief, President Clinton fully understood the risks that he was imposing on the country's security with his secret affair in the White House. Even in this post-Cold War era, foreign intelligence agents constantly look for opportunities for deception, propaganda, and blackmail. No higher targets exist than the President and the White House. The President even acknowledged in a phone call with Ms. Lewinsky that foreign agents could be monitoring their conversations. Yet this knowledge did not dissuade the President from continuing his affair. With premeditation, he chose his own gratification above the security of his country and the success of his presidency. Then he chose to compound the damage by systematically lying about it over the span of many months. 
   I believe that our country will be stronger and better prepared to meet our challenges with a cleansing of the Presidency. The President of the United States is the most powerful person in the world because we are the strongest country economically and militarily, and in the appeal of our idealism for liberty and freedom of conscience. Our President must be strong because a President personifies the rule of law that he is sworn to uphold and protect. We must believe him and trust him if we are to follow him. His influence on domestic and foreign policies comes from that trust, which a lifetime of words, deeds, and achievements has built. 
   President Clinton has betrayed that trust. His leadership has been diminished because most Americans have come to the cynical conclusion that they must read between the lines of his statements and try to catch a glimmer of truth amidst the spin. His subordinates have demeaned public life by contending that ``everybody does it'' as a defense of why the President has erred so grievously. But every President does not lie to a federal grand jury. Every President does not obstruct justice. The last President to do so was President Nixon, and he had sufficient reverence for the office to resign before the House even voted articles of impeachment. 
   The impeachment trial must come to an end. The Presidency will be strengthened and our ability as Americans to meet important challenges will be strengthened if we begin to restore our faith in the truth and justice that our government must exemplify and preserve. It will not be enough simply to condemn the tragic misdeeds of President Clinton. He must be removed from office as the Constitution prescribes, and we must celebrate the strength of that same Constitution which also provides a path for a new beginning. 
   Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. I yield the floor.

    Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I rise today to offer legislation amending the Residential Substance Abuse Treatment program, known as R-SAT, to enable jurisdictions below the state level to realize greater benefits from the program. The R-SAT program allows the Attorney General to make grants for the establishment of treatment programs within local correctional facilities, but only a few jurisdictions have been able to take advantage of these grants. 
   The legislation I am offering today will solve this problem by establishing a separate Jail-Based Substance Abuse Treatment Program, or J-SAT. Under this new program, states will be explicitly authorized to devote up to ten percent of the funds they receive under R-SAT to qualifying J-SAT programs. 
   This legislation will provide matching funds to jail-based treatment programs that meet several criteria. First, the program must be at least three months in length. This is the minimum amount of time for a treatment program to have the desired effect. To qualify for funding, a program must also have been in existence for at least two years. This criterion is intended to ensure that jurisdictions which have already demonstrated a commitment to treatment programs at the local level receive first priority for funding. It also ensures that scarce treatment resources are allocated to programs with a demonstrable track record of success. The third criterion for programs seeking J-SAT funding is that the treatment regimen must include regular drug testing. This is necessary to ensure that some objective measure of the program's success is available. Grant recipients are also encouraged to provide the widest range of aftercare services possible, including job training, education and self-help programs. These steps are necessary to leverage the resources devoted to solving the problem of substance abuse, and to give individuals involved in treatment the best possible chance for successful rehabilitation. 
   I am offering this legislation because substance abuse and problems arising from it are putting a severe strain on the resources of local jurisdictions throughout the nation. This is not a minor problem. The Office of National Drug Control Policy indicates that approximately three-fourths of prison inmates--and over half of those in jails or on probation--are substance abusers, yet only a small percentage of inmates participate in treatment programs while they are incarcerated. The time during which drug-using offenders are in custody or under post-release correctional supervision presents a unique opportunity to reduce drug use and crime through effective drug testing and treatment programs. 
   Research indicates that programs like J-SAT can help to reduce the strain on our communities by cutting drug use in half; by reducing other criminal activity like shoplifting, assault, and drug sales by up to 80 percent; and by reducing arrests for all crimes by up to 64 percent. 
   I would also note that jail-based treatment programs are cost effective. In 1994, the American Correctional Association estimated the annual cost of incarceration at $18,330. The Office of National Drug Control Policy states that treatment while in prison and under post-incarceration supervision can reduce recidivism by roughly 50 percent. Thus, for every $1,800 the government invests in treatment, it saves more than $9,000. Former Assistant Health Secretary Philip Lee has estimated that every dollar invested in treatment can save $7 in societal and medical costs.

    Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to a much-loved and respected Hoosier statesman, David Worth Dennis, who passed away on January 6, 1999, at the age of 86. David Dennis represented the eastern section of the State of Indiana in the United States House of Representatives from 1969 to 1975. He served with great courage and distinction on the House Judiciary Committee during the difficult Watergate period. 
   David Dennis' commitment to public service began before and extended beyond his three terms in the House of Representatives. After his graduation from Earlham College and Harvard Law School, he began his career practicing law in Richmond, Indiana. He then served as the prosecuting attorney for Wayne County, Indiana, and then as a First Lieutenant in the JAG Corps of the U.S. Army. He served in the Pacific theater at the end of World War II. Shortly after he came home to Indiana in 1946, he won a seat in the Indiana General Assembly, where he served a total of four terms. 
   I first met Dave during his service in the Indiana House of Representatives, and I frequently corresponded with him during his United States Congressional service. I was pushing the extension of the ``New Federlism,'' in which states and cities obtained and exercised more responsibility. I also was advocating general revenue sharing in which the federal government would send money to states and cities without strings attached in order that the discharge of these additional responsibilities could be paid for. Dave was enthusiastic about diminishing federal prerogatives, but somewhat less enthusiastic about a distribution of federal revenues. 
   Our coming together on the campaign trail in 1974 led to enormous mutual respect. The Judiciary Committee was a battleground for efforts to impeach President Richard Nixon. Dave was a very loyal Republican but, even more importantly, he was a scholarly and thoughtful legislator who believed that insufficient evidence had been produced to vote for articles of impeachment in the Committee. As additional evidence withheld by President  Nixon became known, Dave became outspoken in his condemnation of the cover-up and in his demand that President Nixon should resign. 
   I was privileged to watch at close range a courageous public servant at work who, even in the midst of a partisan election campaign, was never in doubt that he should speak the truth as he saw it and let the chips fall where they may. 
   Neither Dave nor I were successful in the 1974 campaign, but I looked forward throughout subsequent years to our meetings. We not only reminisced about battles of the past, we discussed the future with expectations that great things could occur in our country through constructive leadership. 
   David Dennis remained a leader after returning in 1975 to practice law in Richmond, Indiana. Still active in Republican politics, he continued his career as an attorney, where he was loved and respected by the Richmond community. He was known for his fairness and his dedication to the practice of law. Describing Dave's legal calling, a friend quoted in the Richmond Palladium-Item summed up his dedication: ``He understood it as a service to the community. In the same way, David Dennis saw politics as a profession, not a way to get ahead.'' Dave was truly an advocate who loved the roles he played in both the legislative and the judicial systems of our country. 
   I last saw David Dennis at a Republican dinner in Richmond during the 1994 campaign. He was introduced and received a wonderful ovation from Wayne County Republicans, who revered his service and were so grateful for his continuing citizenship in the community he loved. I was able to keep in touch with news of Dave through his son, William C. Dennis II, who served as a remarkably energetic professor at my alma mater, Denison University. 
   In addition to his extensive public service, David Dennis is remembered by friends and family as an engaging storyteller and a skilled tennis player. Most of all, he is remembered as a loyal friend and loving husband and father. 
   My sympathy is with his children, Bill and Ellen, as well as with his four grandchildren as they remember and celebrate the life of an exemplary Hoosier statesman. This standard bearer of a great Quaker tradition at Earlham College added something very special to Indiana Political life. We will miss his wisdom and grace.

   Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce on behalf of myself and Senators HAGEL, HELMS and ROBERTS a package of legislation intended to minimize or eliminate the burden that estate and gift taxes place on our economy. The estate tax hinders entrepreneurial activity and job creation in many sectors of our economy. Despite the fact that my bills would help all Americans who face this onerous tax, I come to the estate tax debate because of my interest in American agriculture. 
   As Chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee, I have held hearings on the impact of the estate tax on farmers and ranchers. The effects of inheritance taxes are fare reaching in the agricultural community. Citing personal experiences, witnesses described how the estate tax discourages savings, capital investment and job formation. 
   One such story came from a Hoosier, Mr. Woody Barton. He is a fifth generation tree farmer living in the house his great grandparents built in 1885. I visited his 300 acres of forested property last October and can attest to its beauty. Typical of many farmers, Mr. Barton is over 65 years old and wants to leave this legacy to his four children. But he fears that the estate tax may cause his children to strip the timber and then sell the land in order to pay the estate tax bill. His grandmother logged a portion of the land in 1939 to pay the debts that came from the death of her husband. In essence, each generation must buy back the hard work and dedication of their ancestors from the federal government. Mr. Barton believes, and I agree, that the actions of Congress have more impact on the outcome of his family's land than his own planning and investment. This should not be the case. 
   The estate and gift tax falls disproportionately hard on our agricultural producers. Ninety-five percent of farms and ranch operations are sole proprietorships or family partnerships, subjecting a vast majority of these businesses to the threat of inheritance taxes. According to USDA figures, farmers are six times more likely to face inheritance taxes than other Americans. And commercial farm estates--those core farms that produce 85 percent of our nation's agricultural products--are fifteen times more likely to pay inheritance taxes than other individuals. 
   This hardship will only get worse as the agricultural community gets older, with the average farmer about to have a 60th birthday. Many farmers will shortly confront estate and gift taxes when they pass their farm onto the next generation. Recently, the USDA estimated that between 1992 and 2002, more than 500,000 farmers will retire. Only half of those positions will be replaced by young farmers. Demographic studies indicate that a quarter of all farmers could confront the inheritance tax during the next 20 years. 
   To combat this problem, today I offer several legislative alternatives to provide relief to those impacted by this tax. My first bill would repeal the estate and gift taxes outright. My second bill would phase out the estate tax over five years by gradually raising the unified credit each year until the tax is repealed after the fifth year. My third bill would immediately raise the effective unified credit to $5 million in an effort to address the disproportionate burden that the estate tax places on farmers and small businesses. My last bill would raise the gift tax exemption from $10,000 to $25,000. 
   I believe the best option is a simple repeal of the estate tax. I am hopeful that during this Congress, as members become more aware of the effects of this tax, we can eliminate it from the tax code. However, even if the estate tax is not repealed, the unified credit must be raised significantly. Despite our most recent success in raising the exemption level, inflation has caused a growing percentage of estates to be subjected to the estate tax. My second bill is intended to highlight this point and provide a gradual path to repeal. 
   My third bill focuses on relieving the estate tax burden that falls disproportionately on farmers and small business owners. By raising the exemption amount to $5 million, 96 percent of estates with farm assets and 90 percent of estates with non-corporate business assets would not have to pay estate taxes, according to the IRS. 
   The final bill in this package would raise the gift tax exemption from $10,000 to $25,000. This level has not been adjusted since 1982. Over the years, the inflation has eroded this exemption amount, and I believe this level must be raised to provide Americans with an additional tool for passing productive assets to the next generation. 
   Despite its modest beginnings in 1916, the estate tax has mushroomed into an exorbitant tax on death that discourages savings, economic growth and job formation by blocking the 
   accumulation of entrepreneurial capital and by breaking up family businesses and farms. With the highest marginal rate at 55 percent, more than half of an estate can go directly to the government. By the time the inheritance tax is levied on families, their assets have already been taxed at least once. This form of double taxation violates perceptions of fairness in our tax system. 
   If we are sincere about boosting economic growth, we must consider what effect the estate tax has on a business owner deciding whether to invest in new capital goods or hire a new employee. The Heritage Foundation estimates that repealing the estate tax would annually boost our economic output by $11 billion, create 145,000 new jobs and raise personal income by $8 billion. These figures underscore the current weight of this tax on our economy. 
   One might expect that for all the economic disincentives caused by the estate tax, it must at least provide a sizable contribution to the U.S. Treasury. But in reality, the estate tax only accounts for about 1 percent of federal taxes. It cannot be justified as an indispensable revenue raiser. Given the blow delivered to job formation and economic growth, the estate tax may even cost the Treasury money. Our nation's ability to create new jobs, new opportunities and wealth is damaged as a result of our insistence on collecting a tax that earns less than 1 percent of our revenue. 
   But this tax affects more than just the national economy. It affects how we as a nation think about community, family and work. Small businesses and farms represent much more than assets. They represent years of toil and entrepreneurial risk taking. They also represent the hopes that families have for their children. Part of the American Dream has always been to build up a business, farm or ranch so that economic opportunities and a way of life can be passed on to one's children and grandchildren. 
   I know first-hand about the dangers of this tax to agriculture. My father died when I was 24, leaving his 604-acre farm in Marion County, Indiana, to his family. I helped manage the farm, which had built up considerable debts during my father's illness. Fortunately, after a number of years, we were successful in working out the financial problems and repaying the money. We were lucky. That farm remains in our family because I have been practicing active estate planning and execution of the plan along with profitable farming for each of the last 40 years. But many of today's farmers and small business owners are not so fortunate. Only about 30 percent of businesses are transferred from parent to child, and only about 12 percent of businesses make it to a grandchild.

   Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation to open foreign markets for U.S. agricultural exports and raise the profile of agriculture in our nation's trade agenda. By enacting the 1996 FAIR Act, commonly known as Freedom to Farm, we gave farmers the right to make planting decisions themselves, free from government controls. But the FAIR Act is a compact. Freedom to Farm means freedom to sell. In exchange for phasing out subsidies, Congress promised its efforts to secure free, fair, and open markets for U.S. agricultural products. The importance of exports to U.S. agriculture has never been greater. This legislation will improve opportunities, allowing us to take advantage of our dominant position in world food trade. 
   Each year, agricultural products make a positive contribution to our international balance of payments. No sector of the U.S. economy is more critically tied to international trade than agriculture. Approximately three out of ten acres of our agricultural production is exported. Farmers are reliant on the ability to export. We can only secure our farmers' and ranchers' future opportunities by removing trade barriers--those we impose on ourselves and those imposed by others. 
   Mr. President, this bill addresses several items, none of which is more important than sanctions reform. Unilateral economic sanctions often keep our farmers out of major markets. Such sanctions do not preclude the targeted country from buying agricultural commodities elsewhere. Rather, sanctions often have a more profound effect on our own country. U.S. competitors are often quick to offset the effect of our sanctions, in the process harming U.S. commercial interests. Contracts are lost and our status as a reliable business partner suffers. A cardinal test of foreign policy is to determine that, when we use sanctions internationally, our actions do less harm to ourselves than to others. Unilateral food sanctions fail that test. 
   Bans on food exports strike at the most basic human need, the availability of food. Authoritarian regimes can survive food sanctions. It is the people of these nations that suffer. The use of food as a weapon should, in most cases, be abandoned. This legislation exempts from unilateral economic sanctions humanitarian and commercial farm exports and gives the President the authority to waive the food exemption. 
   Mr. President, sanctions reform is only one aspect of improving market access. Significant tariff and non-tariff barriers still inhibit the free flow of agricultural goods. The World Trade Organization will hold an important meeting later this year in our own country. The talks which will commence at this meeting offer an important opportunity to expand overseas markets for our agricultural exports. One goal of this legislation is to achieve more fair and open conditions of trade, and the bill I introduce today provides important guidelines for these upcoming negotiations. It aims to open foreign markets and eliminate unfair and negative trade policy. Furthermore, a ``special 301'' provision for agriculture is included in this bill. This language is similar to S.219 which was introduced by Senator DASCHLE and Senator GRASSLEY in the 105th Congress and generated bi-partisan support within agriculture. It provides for an investigative process specifically tailored to agricultural trade. The U.S. Trade Representative will use this process to identify those countries which employ unfair trade practices against U.S. agricultural commodities and value-added products. Once in place, remedies which level the playing field are provided. This authority is important as we strive to break down trade barriers and eliminate practices which foreign countries use to bar U.S. agricultural exports.

   Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I am pleased to submit a Senate resolution expressing the sense of the Senate that the income tax system be abolished and replaced with a broad-based consumption tax on goods and services. 
   I supported IRS reform legislation passed last Congress and will continue to work within the confines of our tax system to improve it. However, the fundamental flaws of the income tax system remain. I strongly believe that Congress should abolish the income tax system in its entirety and begin anew. 
   The problems of the income tax are well documented. By taxing savings and investment at least twice, the income tax has become the biggest impediment to economic growth in the country. Each year it costs Americans more than 5 billion hours of time to comply with it. The system is unfair and riddled with loopholes. It favors foreign imports and discourages American exports. As witnesses testified before Congress last year, the IRS regularly violates the privacy rights of individuals while enforcing the income tax. And finally, the system doesn't work. By its own admission, the Internal Revenue Service fails to collect from nearly 10 million taxpayers, with an estimated $127 billion in uncollected taxes annually. Anything this broken should be ended decisively. 
   One can evaluate a tax system using many criteria. It must be: (1) simple, (2) the least intrusive, (3) fair, (4) transparent, (5) border adjustable, and (6) friendly to savings and investment. I have studied tax reform proposals with these six factors in mind. Many are better than the current income tax. But if we are going to overhaul our tax system, we should choose the one that meets these criteria. I have concluded that a national sales tax is the best alternative. 
   An effective tax system should be simple. Under a national sales tax, the burden of complying with the income tax code would be lifted. There would be no records to keep or audits to fear. According to the Tax Foundation, businesses and individuals spend more than $225 billion to comply with the Tax Code. Under a national sales tax, compliance costs would drop by 90 percent. More than 100 million individuals who currently file taxes would be dropped from the tax rolls. With a national sales tax, the money individuals earned would be their own. Its your decision to save it, invest it, or give it to your children. It is only when you buy something that you are taxed. 
   The national sales tax is the least intrusive of the tax proposals. The IRS would be substantially dismantled. The IRS would no longer look over the shoulders of every taxpayer. Americans would not waste time and effort worrying about recordkeeping, deductions, or exemptions that are part of the current Tax Code. 
   The national sales tax is the fairest alternative. Everyone pays the tax including criminals, illegal aliens, and others who currently avoid taxation. Wealthy Americans with lavish spending habits would pay substantial amounts of taxes under the national sales tax. Individuals who save and invest their money will pay less. Gone are the loopholes and deductions that provide advantages to those with the resources to shelter their income. 
   The national sales tax would also tax the underground economy. When criminals consume the proceeds of their activities, they will pay a tax. Foreign tourists and illegal aliens will pay the tax. Tax systems that rely on income reporting will never collect any of this potential revenue. 
   Of course, the fairness test must likewise consider those with limited means to pay taxes. Like the income tax system, a national sales tax can and should be constructed to lessen the tax burden on those individuals with the least ability to pay. One strategy for addressing this problem would exempt a threshold level of goods and services consumed by each American from the federal sales tax. Another strategy is to exempt items such as housing, food or medicine. I am committed to designing a tax system that does not fall disproportionately on the less fortunate. 
   The national sales tax is the most transparent. A federal tax that is evident to everyone would bolster efforts in Congress to achieve prudence in federal spending. There should be no hidden corporate taxes that are passed on to consumers or withholding mechanisms that mask the amount we pay in taxes. Harvard economist Dale Jorgenson estimates that the corporate income tax and its compliance costs increase the cost of goods by 20 to 25 percent. The national sales tax would bring all these hidden costs into the sunshine. Every year the public and Congress should openly debate the tax rate necessary for the federal government to meet its obligations. If average Americans are paying that rate every day, they will make certain that Congress spends public funds wisely. 
   American exports would also benefit from the enactment of a national sales tax. We must adopt a tax system that encourages exports. Most of our trading partners have tax systems that are border adjustable. They are able to strip out their tax when exporting their goods. In comparison, the income tax is not border adjustable. American goods that are sent overseas are taxed twice--once by the income tax and once when they reach their destination. In comparison, the national sales tax would not be levied on exports. It would place our exports on a level playing field with those of our trading partners. 
   But the last and most imperative reason for replacing the income tax  with a national sales tax is that it would energize our economy by encouraging savings. The bottom line is that as a nation, we do not save enough. Savings are vital because they are the source of all investment and productivity gains--savings supply the capital for buying a new machine, developing a new product or service, or employing an extra worker. 
   The Japanese save at a rate nine times greater than Americans, and the Germans save five times as much as we do. Today, many believe that Americans inherently consume beyond their means and cannot save enough for the future. Few realize that before World War II, before the income tax system developed into its present form, Americans saved a larger portion of their earnings than the Japanese. 
   A national sales tax would reverse this trend by directly taxing consumption and leaving savings and investment untaxed. Economists agree that a broad-based consumption tax would increase our savings rate substantially. Economist Laurence Kotlikoff of Boston University estimates that our savings rate would more than triple in the first year. Economist Dale Jorgenson of Harvard University has concluded that the United States would have experienced one trillion dollars in additional economic growth if it had adopted a consumption tax like the national sales tax in 1986 instead of the current system. 
   As I have outlined here today, I believe the national sales tax is the best tax system to replace the income tax. If we enact a tax system that encourages investment and savings, billions of dollars of investment will flow into our country. This makes sense--America has the most stable political system, the best infrastructure, a highly educated workforce and the largest consumer market in the world. Our economic growth and prosperity would be unsurpassed. I am committed to bringing this message of hope to all Americans, and I look forward to working with my colleagues on advancing this important endeavor.
